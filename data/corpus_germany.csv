Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

I think what you're going to see is likely this will. Will cessa to the point where be some form of direction provided to toronto police. Toronto police would likely through a public order response attempt to facilitate a peaceful are peaceful removal. And if then take appropriate measures to make an arrest. It's one thing to attempt to enforce trespass notice, which is you're probably where provincial statute compared to define a lawful order directed to from the court. I'm wondering whether, you know, the university of toronto has any takeaways here. I mention to the beginning how the university's tried different comes to mind you, what happened in alberta. >> I'm sure you're familiar. The university of calgary and the university of alberta edmonton. They moved in quite quickly. And this kind of thing never actually happened here. Do you think the university made a mistake, steve, by allowing this to go on and on and on. >> Well, it's subjective opinion, todd, that sir, question first of all, what happened in calgary? There could be different and it's you could be having different behaviours like speak to a public safety concern. In toronto. I'm not certain what evidence the u of t would put forward is to whether people's access and egress is being prevented to what degree is this creating a risk to students or people having lawful access request. University. And also the point is, sir, in the intel, there's any suggestion of activities occurring within this encampment area. The needs immediate response. So where do we see this going to see probably injunction being issued to toronto police, toronto police will. Inappropriate and unprofessional manner attempt to speak to certain individuals as a group tried cree voluntary compliance if not, then executed minister arrests were record. Yeah, I wonder, you know, the protesters are no doubt aware, steve, that this is likely coming. I mean, they're, you know, they're watching very carefully what's happening here talk to me about worries fears concerns over escalation as police may move in. Yeah, great question. Again. But backers, public order, I've been involved in situations like that years ago in my role as a police officer to supervisor. What you need to do is get information on who the occupants our some of the participants with a demonstration of the knowledgeable are the accoring legal advice. Are their instigators. They're likely to provoke tears. Are there certain people in me? In the crowd during the gathering could be was too take some form of action to press illustrate that its students demonstrating don't know. But you have to separate that from what you see. So you try to speak to people like one person at a time. Treaty creek compliance. He would try to this. You try to deal with the situation for periphery. He would try to globally move all people. So no doubt. Legal counsel says there are no media's. There are people are still me up. Some people have their own agenda. Some people have a mission. I understand that there are still some form of meetings going on with the university of toronto. The courts will wait to see if any remedies will become from snow self within if that's great with some people leave on their own, whether people need to stay back and we need to identify the profile of the individuals or in the account they all there for the series. And one success through gives police a far better chance understanding as to what they might be actually dealing with. Hey, steve, always a pleasure. Thanks for taking a bit of time today. We'll see how it plays out. I hope we can reach out to you again as the story unfolds. >> Thank you to stay tuned for steve summerville, former cop with the toronto police department with his take. Meantime, a solidarity rally was held outside of a toronto jewish girls school earlier. Today is an elementary school together in coming 2 days after shots were fired. At the school on saturday. Ctv's rahim ladhani has more. Showing strength in numbers. A large crowd gathered as parents dropped off their children. >> At base was entry school for class on monday. Everybody's there for each other and that's how we have to stand together as unity in one and show that you hurt one, you hurt us all the show of solidarity comes after evidence of bullet holes in the windows were found over the weekend while no one was inside the school when shots were fired just before 5 saturday morning. The incident has left the jewish community shaken. Oftentimes you did stories on the news and its ads and you try to be empathetic when it's at home. It's a whole different this is not close to home. This is home. Police say it's too early in their investigation to say whether this was a hate crime or an act of terrorism. >> However, politicians have been quick to call the offence antisemitic. >> It involves the boss of empathy and compassion between people. It's a noted the pay over society into hate and and absolutely no place in toronto

since the shooting. Police have increased their presence in certain neighbourhoods, including this jewish girls school. >> None of us want to have to drop her kids off at school behind heavy police presence. But this is unacceptable and things have to change and they hope this solidarity gathering is a step towards that. I was there in ladhani reporting from toronto. Let's go to ottawa a related story. There's a parliamentary committee meeting today to discuss concerns about anti-semitism. The committee will be hearing from a number of different voices, including presidents of different canadian universities, big ones in montreal, toronto and vancouver. >> The committee will talk about antisemitism, including on university campuses and additional measures that might be taken to try and protect canada's jewish community. Listen to this. >> Unequivocally condemns anti-semitism and all forms of racism and discrimination. Anti-semitic acts have no place on our campuses or in our communities. They must be stopped learning and support of campus free from harassment, intimidation or fear for one safety is critical for students and for the integrity of our institutions. >> And includes the presidents of concordia and mcgill in montreal. The university of toronto, which of course is dealing with its pro-palestinian cabin issue. And university of british columbia in vancouver. And we'll be speaking to the committee throughout the day 7. >> Life completely changed for canadians. >> All right, we're going to follow this breaking news. Well, bring you up to speed on an amber alert that has been issued in the province of quebec for 2 young children in the town of saint now sand is located east from quebec city police are looking for a 3 year-old. Her name is evelyn gorge and the 2 year-old charlotte bush. >> It's believed they were taken by 40 year-old kevin gorge. We're not sure if he's the father. Police haven't confirmed the exact relation to those 2 kids. They are reportedly, though, in a 2013 white honda. Take a look at the details here. 2013 white honda civic with a black hood. And the license plate. The quebec plate is 53 va c e. >> And kevin goerges, 1.7 metres tall is believed to be about 100 and 85 pounds. Anyone with any information, either within possibly elsewhere. Ontario, new brunswick, depending should call police immediately. >> Let's take a look at what's happening right now in ottawa. And it is very, very wet in ottawa. And the capital is under a tornado watch environment. Canada issuing this watch for the ottawa gatineau area. >> Just across the river in quebec, strong winds, large hail, torrential rain and favourable conditions for a possible tornado. Here's the warning from environment canada. People in the national capital region and across the river in gatineau should be prepared to take cover if the weather takes a turn to a major international story. More than 2000 people are believed to have been buried alive after a massive landslide in papa new guinea happen again is in the south pacific, just north of australia, fairly remote. The landslide happened 3 days ago on friday, heavy rain and the remoteness of the area in the country where it happened, making rescue and recovery efforts even more challenging. >> They are trying to rescue whatever they can >> By using the taking 6. States. At the cultural forks. And their hands. Of course. >> The government in papa new guinea putting out a national call for support in the search efforts. But getting people to that part of the country. He is very difficult to people in the region itself of also been hesitant to bring in heavy machinery to clear away the debris. Instead, they have been actually looking for those buried by hand. There are also fears that water flowing below the debris could lead to yet another landslide. There's also a lot of difficulty in getting an accurate estimate of the population in that part of papa new guinea because the country's last census was 24 years ago. And there are a lot of people who live in remote villages up in the mountains, back in our country, more than 2 weeks after they were forced out by wildfires close to 5,000 people from fort nelson, british columbia in the northeastern part of that province finally allowed to go back home today. Now the park or lake wildfire is still burning out of control. People are being advise that although they can go home, they need to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. Once again, listen to this. >> The fire is it's, it's stated that it's a mop up stage. So essentially it's the edges of the fire contained it. Stop burning are still fires out on the land a burning in the black racism, nothing on the units that are caused the fire to towards the community. If we get a long dry spell I got has a lot of when that's certainly can change and that's why we're still on evacuation alert. >> Yeah, this is a course great news for people who have been down in fort st. John and other parts pink mountain. Other places in dawson creek, british

Just maybe you want to bolster what I was just saying, julia, what stood out to you as you listened to what the president was laying out there. >> Perhaps not a big surprise with the verdict but still a stark assessment of the situation in gaza, particularly since israel started its offensive in rafah. Just a couple of weeks ago. And the deterioration as the president of the international court was painting a picture of a very difficult situation in terms of the humanitarian conditions on the ground, and he was referencing particularly the facts that there had been evacuation orders issued in advance by israel, warning that it was going into rafah, that led to the displacement of some 800,000 people, according to the united nations. And what I think was interesting from this ruling was the fact that the judges found that that wasn't good enough, the fact that there had been advance warning. They said that the situation to where -- where the people had been moved to simply wasn't good enough, they were living without roofs, without water, without any kind of sanitary conditions, and of course very limited access to aid, which is why the icj has made its judgment that the rafah crossing needs to be reopened. We've been hearing major concerns about the fact that since israel took control of the gaza side of that crossing, there hasn't been any aid coming from egypt into gaza over the last couple of weeks. And although there are other routes and israel has insisted that it isn't blocking aid, that's been a major sticking point for aid groups where we heard the judges talking about the world food program, not having access to a warehouse in rafah as well. So a really stark picture of what's going on there, but, yes, the headlines effectively that the court is ordering israel to halt its rafah offensive, open the rafah crossing and allow investigators in to ensure that israel is complying with an order from earlier in the year by the icj that it meets to prevent a genocide in gaza. >> Heather: just again, getting a little bit of context to all of this, again, ordering the stop to the rafah incursion, some had expected the icj could go even further and order a stop to the entire wars the entire offensive in gaza broadly, that has not happened, nor did it happen with the initial ruling back in january. So this is rafah specific. Interesting that the votes in all of these were 13-2, and the american representative on the international court who's a justice by the name of sarah haul cleveland, she voted were the majority, so she voted in favour of these provisional measures. In terms of the southwestern ontario come of this, this is legally bind bug there is no power to enforce these orders from the international court of justice. By way of understanding, this is brought by south africa, it's part of the larger case, south africa alleges that israel has been involved in acts of genocide. It filed that back last december and this is part of what's making its way through the international court of justice. The main case which deals with that main accusation of genocide it's not expected to start until next we are. Israel has of course denied the case, but this is part of that within what is being investigated and that's part of the, as you said, julia, must be open to any investigators lookings at some of these allegations and looking for evidence. So this is the context to the ruling today. We already know, again, not able to be enforced, israel has already made it clear it will nod adhere to this, whatever it was going to be. No power on earth will stop israel from protecting its citizens and going after hamas in gaza. That's what a government spokesperson has already said. So what is this likely to lead to, as far as israel's response, and I would also like you to look, julia, if you could, to how the world will respond, the kind of isolation, the kind of criticism that we may hear as a result of what the icj has just ruled. >> Well, absolutely. I mean, israel did defend itself at the court last week because it is a member of the united nations and it has to effectively put forward its rebuttal to the south african allegations, so certainly it has been participating in these proceedings and although they are legally binding, as you say, incredibly difficult to enforce on the ground, south africa continuing to press israel on its actions in gaza and although the broader genocide case could take many years, it wants to see pressure put on israel at every stage, particularly as the situation on the ground is evolving. Certainly, we have seen israel already dismiss international courts' efforts to intervene in gaza, saying that israel didn't start this war, it didn't want this war, and it needs to carry out its offensive, it says, in rafah because it's -- the last stronghold of hamas. It says that's necessary to route out hammond every hamas.

certainly that has been its perspective, and although it will be difficult to enforce this, there does add to a growing sense of pressure and isolation on israel, there have been many countries expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza and specifically about the situation in rafah as well which the united states warned against this offensive, although we heard a couple of days ago that the U.S. said no red lines had been crossed there so far. But it does certainly -- verdicts like this, judgments like the icj's judgment today do add to that pressure and help shape the international response, for example, in russia when the icj ruled that its invasion of ukraine was unlawful, that certainly added some legal weight to many countries giving weapons to ukraine. So that is the kind of picture we are expecting going forward there. Could be stronger responses from western countries as this situation in gaza continues. >> We already had, as you and I were talking about, the three countries, spain, ireland and norway going ahead to declare that they will declare an official palestinian state as of next week. Again, as part of this international pressure and growing international condemnation. Julia, thank you. I will let you go for now. Julia chapman going to continue watching the story out of our bureau in london. And as we return to the scenes outside, we do see a small group of pro-palestinian demonstrators. We would expect reaction to come to this judgment from the international court of justice. What we've seen previously is the lawyers for south africa will respond and also the legal team for israel as well. But julia raises a number of questions, what will come of all of this? Will there be suddenly today or increasingly international condemnation? Will any countries go to the point of new sanctions and will there be, as some have been concerned about from the israeli perspective, will this then lead the united nations security council to declare some new form of declaration which would then require the united states to use its veto power in support of israel in all of this? There are many diplomatic and political repercussions to come even if there is no power to enforce this decision just out from the international court of justice.

The icj has ordered israel to keep the rafah border crossing open, to allow investigators access to the gaza territory, and to report back on the measures israel has taken in one month's time. This is all in response to a request from south africa for a cease-fire, the court's ruling is legally binding, but the icj cannot enforce it and israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. >> Outrage over the war in gaza continues to spark strong reaction and protest in this country. A pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto's main campus has just over six hours left to respond to the school's latest bid to end the demonstration. Meagan fitzpatrick is on campus today. >> The university publicly released the offer that has been presented to students at around :30 yesterday. So it outlines the proposed responses to the protesters' demands. When it comes to the students' demands around u of t divesting from companies that support the israeli military, that's one of the demands of the students, not to have any university money invested in those kinds of companies, the university is proposing to set up an advisory committee to do a review of the university's investments, essentially and that advisory committee would be made up of students and staff and faculty and alumni and they are saying representatives from the encampment can suggest membership on that committee and that committee would be asked to report back to the president by no later than the end of october. Also on the students' demand for more disclosure around the university's investments, the school is proposing to set up a working group to look at that, looking at ways of increasing transparency around investments, and that group would be asked to report back by mid july. On the protesters' demand around u of t cutting academic ties with some israeli institutions, the university on that point is essentially saying that's a no go, that the university rejects that demand, saying they will not terminate any partnerships with israeli universities or engage in any academic boycotts. They say they will continue to look at ways of increasing opportunities for palestinian scholars here at the university of toronto. So those are sort of the bare bones of some of the offer that the school is presenting to the protesters. In terms of the timing & this offer now, here's a bit of what the u of. It's president merrick gardener said about that. >> It's also clear that many members of our community feel increasing distress by the presence of the encampment. They feel unsafe, they have reported feelings of -- and experience of discrimination and harassment, we have also had reports of hateful speech and hateful acts which we have reported promptly to toronto police service. After hearing these complaints of our community and after recognizing how long the use of this space has been denied to other members of our community, we felt now is the time to act.

>>> My apologies, that's merrick gertner, not garden temple in he said the offer presented to the student is conditional on them clearing the encampment, not setting it up anywhere else on campus and letting convocation ceremonies proceed uninterrupted. That first convocation ceremony set to be held on june 3rd, right over there. And the president saying those ceremonies will go ahead regardless of whether the students accept this offer. >> That is meagan fitzpatrick on campus at u of t this morning. >> There is breaking news just now from canadian border and customs officers, that they could go on strike as early as next month. In a release just out this morning, their union says workers with cbsa, canada border service agency have voted the 6% in favour of job action. Now, there's no strike date yet, but their union expects to be in an illegal strike position in early june. 90% of border officers are considered essential can't can't walk off the job but it could cause delays for travellers at border crossing as and at airports of course right at the time of the busy holiday season. Now this. >> Hey, this is andrew McCARTHY calling you. >> Hey ally. >> Hey, molly. >> Let's call rob. >> Hello. >> Judge? >> Andrew McCARTHY tracking down the gang for a new documentary about the brat pack.

Also ordering israel to keep the rafah border crossing open for basic supplies for humanitarian aid, to allow investigators access to the territory in gaza to investigate what is at the basis of the south african allegation of genocide, and report back on all measures israel has taken in a month. Those are the four key points from the decision you saw live on cbc morning live, this is all in request for south africa's request for a cease-fire. The ruling is legally binding, the icj cannot enforce it. Israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. Now, we're looking here at live pictures outside the building known as the peace palace, this is the icj, the international court of justice, and we do expect to see as we've seen in past moments on this case lawyers from both sides on the steps of the courthouse responding to the icj decision. We will have that for you live just as soon as we see. As far as reaction, we are just

hearing through reuters from, palestinian authority, here is the statement from the palestinian authority, welcoming the icj decision and saying it represents, quote, an international consensus to end israel's war on gaza. That again from the palestinian presidency, a spokesperson to the reuters news agency. And we will continue to bring you reaction, there is just some reaction and now again to reuters from israel's finance minister, saying that after this ruling, those who demand that israel stop the war are demanding that it should decide to cease to exist, israel will not agree to that. That gives you a sense of the kind of reaction we will see from both sides to come. So we will watch that story very closely through the day here on cbc news network, and just before we go, let's touch base one more time with chris murphy and our forecast heading into the weekend, race weekend in ottawa, all sorts of activities outdoors, all across the country, chris, have a good one. >> Thank you, you too, heather, yeah, big travel weekend in the states, memorial day weekend and again from the upper midwest right down to the southern plains, severe weather there. We've got rain on the north side of our low pressure system. This is the biggest weather maker for today, certainly, in southern manitoba, where we could be looking at more than 50 millimeters worth of rain by the time it ends tomorrow. This is a slow-moving system and locally heavy bands of rain and it's a cold rain, 4° in brandon, 10 in winnipeg, and you will be lucky if you see 10 and we could be getting into wet snow towards riding and turtle and duck mountain, those kind of parts, a little higher elevation. Over towards southern alberta and southern british columbia, another day where we can get some more showers and thunderstorms. Medicine hat has had 110 millimeters of rain so far in may. That is more than double what you would normally get. We could get more thunderstorms there. So there's your heavy rain and wet snow lifting northward, so by tomorrow afternoon, that rain is winding down in the south. More scattered showers and likely thunderstorms into the bc interior and for the south coast, you've got some scattered showers, for the next few days and below seasonal values as well. So the west is getting some beneficial rain, although when you start talking about 50-plus millimeters, we're talking tractors getting stuck in the field. So that's not necessarily good news. But overall, this moisture pattern in the west has been what we needed. Just wish we could get a little bit further north, scattered thunderstorms as mentioned possible, 5 to 15 millimeters of rain for the west coast and this again, portions today, tomorrow, and then there will be more additional rain sunday with those cooler temperatures. Beautiful day in much of the lower great lakes, st. Lawrence river, very warm in the maritimes. Now, keep an eye on your northwest sky because we've got the cold front coming in, so scattered thunderstorms along were it, northwestern new brunswick mid afternoon spreads its way southeastwards through the late afternoon and evening hours, not everybody's going to get a storm, but at this point, we think below severe warning criteria, and there's going to be a chance overnight tonight that southwestern ontario could get a couple of nocturnal storms. That will spread their way eastwards tomorrow, but it's not an all day event saturday. >> The weather update is brought to you by the ""off! Cast"" mosquito forecast.

We begin with breaking news on the israel-hamas war and a ruling just out from the international court of justice in the hague. The judges at the icj had reaffirmed earlier orders in a case brought by south africa, and today they have ordered israel to halt its offensive in rafah. Israel has been ordered to reopen the rafah border crossing to give investigators access and to allow for the flow of aid and humanitarian investors. >> Israel must halt its military actions and any other actions which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza or conditions of life that could bring about the significant destruction. >> A reporter is just outside the court in the hague where that ruling came down. Alex, what can you tell us about the ruling and the potential impact? >> Certainly this ruling we expect would send a clear message and it has done that. The court ordering israel to cease all military operations in rafah. And explaining some of the logic behind that decision. They say the humanitarian situation in rafah can be seen as disastrous, and they are not convinced that israel has put enough in place to cater to that humanitarian support, or to allow for the safe evacuation of civilians. Two fold measures, one, the stopping of all military operations in rafah, and to allow for the axis of the united nations fact-finding mission in rafah as well. Clearly a message from the world court that israel has to do more, must do more, and that things have not approved -- improved since they last ordered israel to do so. Now the bigger question is a bit more complicated. Although these are legally binding orders they are not legally enforceable. The international court of justice says that palestine does not have a police force to enforce these orders. What they can do, or what the un can do is have the security council pass resolutions to sanction israel, force embargoes on israel and have enforcement actions on these orders, but those can be vetoed by the united states. So crucially the relationship between israel and washington dc is not crucial going forward. >> Reporter: as you are speaking, alex -- alex, allegedly hamas has issued a statement, saying that they are urging the security council to implement the icj ruling. Let us move away from the icj for a moment and turn to the icc, where the lead prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant for the israeli prime minister and other top israeli officials, as other -- as well as other members of hamas leadership. Let us talk about the increasing international pressure, presumably, where you are as well, we can hear that screaming, and all the pressure on israel? >> Certainly diplomatic pressure, we have heard spain, ireland and norway saying in a matter of days they will recognize palestinian states. Slovenia and belgium and others should follow suit. But crucially germany and france say the conditions have not been met to recognize palestine as a state, and that remains a big issue. The international criminal court requestinghose arrest warrants , and that decision will be made in a couple of months. That would mean that prime minister netanyahu, defence minister gallant, would not be able to travel to 124 countries around the world, including canada and most of the european union states as well for fear of being arrested. Now also the leadership of hamas , the leaders of hamas who organized the atrocities of october seventh are as well subject to those arrest warrants. But you are right to say that there is a building diplomatic pressure. Perhaps one difference is the new dutch government that will be formed in the next few days, and they seem to be more supportive of israel than the previous one. Globally speaking, more pressure on israel to do more, but there are se excepti >> Natasha: alex caddy eight, at the hague. Thank you. Let us get closer to the actual war. Let us go to gaza, where the israeli army says they have retrieved the bodies of three more hostages killed during the october 7th attack by hamas militants. The military says the recovery was part of a special operation in northern gaza which had seen erce fighting in recent days. Irris makler joins us now from jerusalem. She is tracking not part of the story. What do we know at this stage?

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

( ) >> Todd: welcome back to ctv news channel. Things are going fromad to worse for israel. The country is facing new outrage and condemnation after admitting that there were mistaken air strikes on a refugee camp in southern gaza. Now the country's prime minister benjamin netanyahu yes something unfortunately went tragically wrong promising an investigation. We're hearing upwards of 45 people killed including women and children. Ctv's colton praill is in the capital tracking all of this and what will be out rage colton against israel over this. >> Reporter: todd, we're already seeing it from the international community. This is quick to happen today and continuing as the day goes on. The fact we saw israelist prime minister benjamin netanyahu stand up in the country's parliament today and call this a mistake, say something did tragically go wrong here shows the amount of pressure that israel is under. Unprecedented to this point. We have the ruling of the international court of justice on friday specifically calling out concerns continuing with the military operation in rafah over the loss of life and inability to conduct military operations without dramatic civilian loss of life and following that two days later you have this strike happening at an encampment near rafah where the israeli army the idf says their intelligence told them no civilians would be harmed by this, but as you can see in the video here that's on the screen and the data we have from the gaza ministry of health and important to note that is hamas run. They say 45 dead, 250 or so injured. That number could still climb further. It's a very different scenario than the one that the idf says they green lit. So the fact that you do have the israeli prime minister standing up and acknowledging this speaks to not only the challenge of the situation in rafah but the

international pressure he is facing because since this strike, a number of countries have come out quite strongly. Spain has threatened potential sanctions. They said it may be time to consider that as long as the operation in rafah is ongoing and israel continues to ignore the order from the icj, france said they are out raged by this urging israel to follow the orders. We have also seen a number of very high profile people including the high commissioner of the united states come out and not mince words about this saying that not only was this horrific but entirely predictable outcome even going as far as to say there has been no apparent change in the means or methods of warfare that israel is operating within and so with all of that international pressure, we're seeing much more focus on the way that israel operates as compared to what we have seen in the past. We're seeing a much tighter focus on their decision to continue these bombardments questioning whether casualty rates we are seeing justify the military objective. Israel was quick to point out they did kill two senior hamas commanders in this strike. >> Todd: ctv's colton praill in ottawa with the latest. Thank you. We'll keep an eye on it and you will from the capital. >> Reporter: any time. >> Todd: there is a parliamentary committee also going on in ottawa over growing concern of anti-sematic in canada and it will hear from a number of voices and it already heard from some including prominent presidents including concordia president and talking about anti-semitism on campuses and more measures to be taken to try to protect the jewish community. >> Condemns anti-semitism and all forms of racism and discrimination. Hateful anti-sematic acts have no places on the campuses or in the communities. They must be stopped.

And as the university of toronto threatens legal action if protestors don't clear out by monday morning, hussein says here they're still in talks with the university. >> It's kind of telling considering the university does value property more than the students.

And anyone who has any information about the whereabouts of this vehicle or kevin gore's or those children are being asked to call their local police immediately to the middle east. And israel's prime minister, benjamin netanyahu and his country under fire once again. Now he is calling it a tragic mistake after an airstrike hit a refugee camp in gaza and the rafah area leading to the deaths of dozens of palestinians. Here's more from netanyahu in a row. >> But a few bump into. Comey will be a saying here that they tried to evacuate upwards of a million civilians out of harm's way. Gaza officials, health officials say the strike killed at least 45 people, including women and children. Israeli military claiming the strike killed 2 senior hamas militants. Netanyahu admitting the operation went wrong despite israel's efforts to protect and evacuate civilians. United states is calling on israel to do more to protect civilians. Says it is now working with the israeli defence force to assess what happened. But you can see tense, literally burning and charred vehicles as well. Here at home, the leader of the ndp, jagmeet singh is calling on the trudeau government to do more to send a message to israel. >> We're seeing at the rafah is horrific. We saw women and children burned alive. Intense. And what we've seen from this government is delay. So we'll be asking questions in question period today. What will it take for the prime minister? What will it take for the liberal government to finally send a clear message to netanyahu that is actions are inexcusable. And that we demand the government take every step possible to prevent a genocide. >> These are some of the aftermath during the day what it looked like and you can see charred cars and tense reduced to ashes. It acted comes just 2 days after the international court of justice or icj ordered israel to end its military offensive into rafah. Israel, of course, has not and in all likelihood will not comply with that order, which is unenforceable. There are still tens of thousands of people in that part of rafah, even though that area was designated a so-called safe zone after being pressed by the ndp in question period today about this story. Our foreign affairs minister, melanie joly stood up and called once again for and immediate cease-fire. >> Women and children were burned alive. Intense. They were told they were in a safe zone in a refugee in cabinet, yet they were burned alive. What will it take for this liberal government to send a message to netanyahu that what has happened is inexcusable. >> The killing of innocent civilians is completely unacceptable. And the decisions of the international court of justice are binding the level of human suffering is catastrophic. And that's why mister speaker, we need an immediate cease-fire. >> Meantime, back in our country and 8:00am deadline has now come and gone about 3 hours checking the clock here for demonstrators at a pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto to clear out protest organizers say they plan to hold their ground. It's part of an effort, they say, to force the university to meet their demands. >> We do owe this to community that all fell at a rally with us earlier this morning, where we had hundreds of workers come out or fell. Of course, that represents over a million workers. 54 unions, it shows admin to the people are on our side. We have another meeting scheduled with administration at 5:00pm. And we're hoping to continue negotiation with them at that time. >> Well, here's the thing. Some critics say the university of toronto a caused this by enabling the protesters to stay. They have been there for almost a month now. And a member of the university's chose a different strategy in alberta, for example, university of calgary moved in quite quickly. Toronto decided different approach to be more conciliatory. What started out as a few tense soon grow too upwards of 100 tents. And now it is a stalemate. So how's it all going to play out? Let's bring in ctv's cristina tenalia, she's in our national newsroom following it all for us. They are trespassing. The school is now asking the courts to intervene as well. Christina. Yeah, so tight. Apparently, this group has always been trespassing. According to the university of toronto, while they recognize as an institution and of >> Really as canadians that the right for people of this country to have peaceful

assembly and free expression in the form of protest. They acknowledge their property, despite what some people may believe they say is private property and that, well, they may authorize the use of their property like king's college circle to various groups from time to time and encampment. So an encampment, a gathering of that kind on the university of toronto property that is considered trespassing, that something the university of toronto made clear earlier this month. They say it a second the date they're using as to as to when this encampment popped up is still essentially they have allowed this encampment to remain on the university of toronto property for a club for about a month now under what they say is trespassing. Last night, the university of toronto provided trespassing notices to the protesters actually was in the 4 o'clock hour eastern time and the deadline was 8 eastern this morning. Well, the deadline came and went, as you've noted throughout the day, todd and the protesters remain to here's what's next. What you're looking at on your screen. Here's the university of toronto is noting that they are seeking an injunction in court. Essentially what that means is it that they go to court and and if if granted, if it's successful, it's telling the protesters you have to cease and desist. You got to leave or you will be in contempt of court. The protesters for their part are standing their ground. So they did not leave by the 8:00am eastern time deadline this morning. Also last week on thursday university, the university of toronto president provided a very thorough offer to protesters in terms of what the university was willing to do and how the university was willing to move forward in this, in this process, the protesters for their part, they say not good enough. They presented their own very thorough counter counter offer. Yesterday, the 2 sides are scheduled to meet at some point today. But we're, we're here at an impasse. Here's more from one of the spokespeople for for the palestinian supporters as part of the might of all of this, despite all the horrors and atrocities we're seeing every single day last 234 days. >> U of t continues to tell us they cannot make commitments. And that we must go through a bureaucratic committees committees that will lead us nowhere. But we do not have time for committees. We do not have time to wait.

Todd, we know we have seen this across the country. It's a process that pretty speedy, but could still take a few days in terms of having a hearing, so that we anticipate that they'll be some kind of hearing on this matter the that the injunction application will go before a judge at some point in the next few days. And again, in the meantime, the university in the protesters will meet at some point today. But as we've seen from the group, as we've heard from the pro-palestinian protesters who have gathered for the last month at the university of toronto. They're not satisfied with the offers made by the university. And there is no indication that they're going to leave at any point soon. I mean, they may be compelled by the court, but it may has. One spokesperson for the palestinian group told us earlier today they're concerned it could get ugly. They say, and that they may be forced out by police.

And so I think, you this is the last ditch attempt during very desperate times to have this administration finally pay attention. It is very much like the last ditch attempt that workers that make when they go on strike and from a picket line and it is by the labour movement must and will defend this kind of action.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

As of august first, 450 licensed grocery stores will be allowed to sell coolers in cases of beer. Let's bring in retail expert bruce wender. Bruce, thank you for being here is always. The ontario premier says it is a promise being fulfilled. But what is your take on this rollout? Mag yes, I think it will be good overall. It is sort of taking a chip away at the monopoly or quasi- monopoly that the beers tour. And I do think it offers a lot more convenience. And also help small business. It helps bring traffic into a lot of these variety stores and maybe other groceries. So I do think overall it is a positive move. >> Renée: there is some criticism on the someone of them is about lcb obeying the exclusive wholesaler of alcohol to grocery stores and convenient stores, would you make of that? >> That is sort of it is what it is. Dale cbo's been around for decades, if not a hundred years and they continued to do that, it does show some type of measured approach do this through regulating it through one entity. But the beer side has opened up a lot more in the l cbo has a few problems right now as it relates to getting spirits this summer. But it is what it is. It is sort of a migration towards a democratized alcohol system. >> Renée: now one of the other major concerns of the reimbursement of the beer store of up to $225 million. That is taxpayer money, to support the transition for the store, what is your assessment of that? >> I guess that was a deal between the government and the beer store. But it sounds like part of that is tuesday tried to sort of keep some beer stores open when the volume goes away, because quite a few canadians, I think six or 7000 people in ontario work at the beer store. I think the government is trying to sort of transition those jobs. And in addition, they are using the beers for the primary distribution or redistribution for empties and returns. So do think they are trying to transition this away from the beers for but still leave them with enough so that they can continue operating and helping out where possible. >> Renée: while accessible be easier for the consumer, is there any other benefits that

show it to you? >> The big benefit will be for the convenience store the smaller grocery, this will help bring people into your stores. And that to me is the big plus here. Helping to create some volume for small business, because small businesses got sort of beaten up a lot over the past few years as a result of the pandemic. >> Renée: on the other side of the coin though, does this put jobs in jeopardy, say at the out? There is questions, there will be some shifting jobs to your point, I think eventually from the beer store, can they maintain the same staff that they have not now? Probably not down the road. And the lcb domain need less people as well, but hopefully there will be some more jobs created at some of the local groceries and convenient stores to offset that. >> Renée: all right, that's our time, bruce wender, retail expert think through thinking we appreciate your time you think you have immune. >> Renée: as the summer season rounds the corner into view, some drive-in movie theatres are coming back to life.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

2024-05-373661108,eng,False,2024-05-30,18:51:16,2024-05-30T18:51:16Z,2024-05-30T18:51:03Z,news,0.0,https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/05/nato-baltic-sea-security-nord-stream-balticconnector?lang=en,NATO's Path to Securing Undersea Infrastructure in the Baltic Sea,"To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command center that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea region.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Just maybe you want to bolster what I was just saying, julia, what stood out to you as you listened to what the president was laying out there. >> Perhaps not a big surprise with the verdict but still a stark assessment of the situation in gaza, particularly since israel started its offensive in rafah. Just a couple of weeks ago. And the deterioration as the president of the international court was painting a picture of a very difficult situation in terms of the humanitarian conditions on the ground, and he was referencing particularly the facts that there had been evacuation orders issued in advance by israel, warning that it was going into rafah, that led to the displacement of some 800,000 people, according to the united nations. And what I think was interesting from this ruling was the fact that the judges found that that wasn't good enough, the fact that there had been advance warning. They said that the situation to where -- where the people had been moved to simply wasn't good enough, they were living without roofs, without water, without any kind of sanitary conditions, and of course very limited access to aid, which is why the icj has made its judgment that the rafah crossing needs to be reopened. We've been hearing major concerns about the fact that since israel took control of the gaza side of that crossing, there hasn't been any aid coming from egypt into gaza over the last couple of weeks. And although there are other routes and israel has insisted that it isn't blocking aid, that's been a major sticking point for aid groups where we heard the judges talking about the world food program, not having access to a warehouse in rafah as well. So a really stark picture of what's going on there, but, yes, the headlines effectively that the court is ordering israel to halt its rafah offensive, open the rafah crossing and allow investigators in to ensure that israel is complying with an order from earlier in the year by the icj that it meets to prevent a genocide in gaza. >> Heather: just again, getting a little bit of context to all of this, again, ordering the stop to the rafah incursion, some had expected the icj could go even further and order a stop to the entire wars the entire offensive in gaza broadly, that has not happened, nor did it happen with the initial ruling back in january. So this is rafah specific. Interesting that the votes in all of these were 13-2, and the american representative on the international court who's a justice by the name of sarah haul cleveland, she voted were the majority, so she voted in favour of these provisional measures. In terms of the southwestern ontario come of this, this is legally bind bug there is no power to enforce these orders from the international court of justice. By way of understanding, this is brought by south africa, it's part of the larger case, south africa alleges that israel has been involved in acts of genocide. It filed that back last december and this is part of what's making its way through the international court of justice. The main case which deals with that main accusation of genocide it's not expected to start until next we are. Israel has of course denied the case, but this is part of that within what is being investigated and that's part of the, as you said, julia, must be open to any investigators lookings at some of these allegations and looking for evidence. So this is the context to the ruling today. We already know, again, not able to be enforced, israel has already made it clear it will nod adhere to this, whatever it was going to be. No power on earth will stop israel from protecting its citizens and going after hamas in gaza. That's what a government spokesperson has already said. So what is this likely to lead to, as far as israel's response, and I would also like you to look, julia, if you could, to how the world will respond, the kind of isolation, the kind of criticism that we may hear as a result of what the icj has just ruled. >> Well, absolutely. I mean, israel did defend itself at the court last week because it is a member of the united nations and it has to effectively put forward its rebuttal to the south african allegations, so certainly it has been participating in these proceedings and although they are legally binding, as you say, incredibly difficult to enforce on the ground, south africa continuing to press israel on its actions in gaza and although the broader genocide case could take many years, it wants to see pressure put on israel at every stage, particularly as the situation on the ground is evolving. Certainly, we have seen israel already dismiss international courts' efforts to intervene in gaza, saying that israel didn't start this war, it didn't want this war, and it needs to carry out its offensive, it says, in rafah because it's -- the last stronghold of hamas. It says that's necessary to route out hammond every hamas.

certainly that has been its perspective, and although it will be difficult to enforce this, there does add to a growing sense of pressure and isolation on israel, there have been many countries expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza and specifically about the situation in rafah as well which the united states warned against this offensive, although we heard a couple of days ago that the U.S. said no red lines had been crossed there so far. But it does certainly -- verdicts like this, judgments like the icj's judgment today do add to that pressure and help shape the international response, for example, in russia when the icj ruled that its invasion of ukraine was unlawful, that certainly added some legal weight to many countries giving weapons to ukraine. So that is the kind of picture we are expecting going forward there. Could be stronger responses from western countries as this situation in gaza continues. >> We already had, as you and I were talking about, the three countries, spain, ireland and norway going ahead to declare that they will declare an official palestinian state as of next week. Again, as part of this international pressure and growing international condemnation. Julia, thank you. I will let you go for now. Julia chapman going to continue watching the story out of our bureau in london. And as we return to the scenes outside, we do see a small group of pro-palestinian demonstrators. We would expect reaction to come to this judgment from the international court of justice. What we've seen previously is the lawyers for south africa will respond and also the legal team for israel as well. But julia raises a number of questions, what will come of all of this? Will there be suddenly today or increasingly international condemnation? Will any countries go to the point of new sanctions and will there be, as some have been concerned about from the israeli perspective, will this then lead the united nations security council to declare some new form of declaration which would then require the united states to use its veto power in support of israel in all of this? There are many diplomatic and political repercussions to come even if there is no power to enforce this decision just out from the international court of justice.

The icj has ordered israel to keep the rafah border crossing open, to allow investigators access to the gaza territory, and to report back on the measures israel has taken in one month's time. This is all in response to a request from south africa for a cease-fire, the court's ruling is legally binding, but the icj cannot enforce it and israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. >> Outrage over the war in gaza continues to spark strong reaction and protest in this country. A pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto's main campus has just over six hours left to respond to the school's latest bid to end the demonstration. Meagan fitzpatrick is on campus today. >> The university publicly released the offer that has been presented to students at around :30 yesterday. So it outlines the proposed responses to the protesters' demands. When it comes to the students' demands around u of t divesting from companies that support the israeli military, that's one of the demands of the students, not to have any university money invested in those kinds of companies, the university is proposing to set up an advisory committee to do a review of the university's investments, essentially and that advisory committee would be made up of students and staff and faculty and alumni and they are saying representatives from the encampment can suggest membership on that committee and that committee would be asked to report back to the president by no later than the end of october. Also on the students' demand for more disclosure around the university's investments, the school is proposing to set up a working group to look at that, looking at ways of increasing transparency around investments, and that group would be asked to report back by mid july. On the protesters' demand around u of t cutting academic ties with some israeli institutions, the university on that point is essentially saying that's a no go, that the university rejects that demand, saying they will not terminate any partnerships with israeli universities or engage in any academic boycotts. They say they will continue to look at ways of increasing opportunities for palestinian scholars here at the university of toronto. So those are sort of the bare bones of some of the offer that the school is presenting to the protesters. In terms of the timing & this offer now, here's a bit of what the u of. It's president merrick gardener said about that. >> It's also clear that many members of our community feel increasing distress by the presence of the encampment. They feel unsafe, they have reported feelings of -- and experience of discrimination and harassment, we have also had reports of hateful speech and hateful acts which we have reported promptly to toronto police service. After hearing these complaints of our community and after recognizing how long the use of this space has been denied to other members of our community, we felt now is the time to act.

>>> My apologies, that's merrick gertner, not garden temple in he said the offer presented to the student is conditional on them clearing the encampment, not setting it up anywhere else on campus and letting convocation ceremonies proceed uninterrupted. That first convocation ceremony set to be held on june 3rd, right over there. And the president saying those ceremonies will go ahead regardless of whether the students accept this offer. >> That is meagan fitzpatrick on campus at u of t this morning. >> There is breaking news just now from canadian border and customs officers, that they could go on strike as early as next month. In a release just out this morning, their union says workers with cbsa, canada border service agency have voted the 6% in favour of job action. Now, there's no strike date yet, but their union expects to be in an illegal strike position in early june. 90% of border officers are considered essential can't can't walk off the job but it could cause delays for travellers at border crossing as and at airports of course right at the time of the busy holiday season.

Also ordering israel to keep the rafah border crossing open for basic supplies for humanitarian aid, to allow investigators access to the territory in gaza to investigate what is at the basis of the south african allegation of genocide, and report back on all measures israel has taken in a month. Those are the four key points from the decision you saw live on cbc morning live, this is all in request for south africa's request for a cease-fire. The ruling is legally binding, the icj cannot enforce it. Israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. Now, we're looking here at live pictures outside the building known as the peace palace, this is the icj, the international court of justice, and we do expect to see as we've seen in past moments on this case lawyers from both sides on the steps of the courthouse responding to the icj decision. We will have that for you live just as soon as we see. As far as reaction, we are just

hearing through reuters from, palestinian authority, here is the statement from the palestinian authority, welcoming the icj decision and saying it represents, quote, an international consensus to end israel's war on gaza. That again from the palestinian presidency, a spokesperson to the reuters news agency. And we will continue to bring you reaction, there is just some reaction and now again to reuters from israel's finance minister, saying that after this ruling, those who demand that israel stop the war are demanding that it should decide to cease to exist, israel will not agree to that. That gives you a sense of the kind of reaction we will see from both sides to come. So we will watch that story very closely through the day here on cbc news network, and just before we go, let's touch base one more time with chris murphy and our forecast heading into the weekend, race weekend in ottawa, all sorts of activities outdoors, all across the country, chris, have a good one. >> Thank you, you too, heather, yeah, big travel weekend in the states, memorial day weekend and again from the upper midwest right down to the southern plains, severe weather there. We've got rain on the north side of our low pressure system. This is the biggest weather maker for today, certainly, in southern manitoba, where we could be looking at more than 50 millimeters worth of rain by the time it ends tomorrow. This is a slow-moving system and locally heavy bands of rain and it's a cold rain, 4° in brandon, 10 in winnipeg, and you will be lucky if you see 10 and we could be getting into wet snow towards riding and turtle and duck mountain, those kind of parts, a little higher elevation. Over towards southern alberta and southern british columbia, another day where we can get some more showers and thunderstorms. Medicine hat has had 110 millimeters of rain so far in may. That is more than double what you would normally get. We could get more thunderstorms there. So there's your heavy rain and wet snow lifting northward, so by tomorrow afternoon, that rain is winding down in the south. More scattered showers and likely thunderstorms into the bc interior and for the south coast, you've got some scattered showers, for the next few days and below seasonal values as well. So the west is getting some beneficial rain, although when you start talking about 50-plus millimeters, we're talking tractors getting stuck in the field. So that's not necessarily good news. But overall, this moisture pattern in the west has been what we needed. Just wish we could get a little bit further north, scattered thunderstorms as mentioned possible, 5 to 15 millimeters of rain for the west coast and this again, portions today, tomorrow, and then there will be more additional rain sunday with those cooler temperatures. Beautiful day in much of the lower great lakes, st. Lawrence river, very warm in the maritimes. Now, keep an eye on your northwest sky because we've got the cold front coming in, so scattered thunderstorms along were it, northwestern new brunswick mid afternoon spreads its way southeastwards through the late afternoon and evening hours, not everybody's going to get a storm, but at this point, we think below severe warning criteria, and there's going to be a chance overnight tonight that southwestern ontario could get a couple of nocturnal storms. That will spread their way eastwards tomorrow, but it's not an all day event saturday. >> The weather update is brought to you by the ""off! Cast"" mosquito forecast. Prevention is the best protection from mosquitoes. >> Is that everything you needed to do, or everything you wereableto do? >> You cannot walk away from this money. >> A quick explanation. >> Announcer: Join David Cochrane forPower & Politics, today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.

We begin with breaking news on the israel-hamas war and a ruling just out from the international court of justice in the hague. The judges at the icj had reaffirmed earlier orders in a case brought by south africa, and today they have ordered israel to halt its offensive in rafah. Israel has been ordered to reopen the rafah border crossing to give investigators access and to allow for the flow of aid and humanitarian investors. >> Israel must halt its military actions and any other actions which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza or conditions of life that could bring about the significant destruction. >> A reporter is just outside the court in the hague where that ruling came down. Alex, what can you tell us about the ruling and the potential impact? >> Certainly this ruling we expect would send a clear message and it has done that. The court ordering israel to cease all military operations in rafah. And explaining some of the logic behind that decision. They say the humanitarian situation in rafah can be seen as disastrous, and they are not convinced that israel has put enough in place to cater to that humanitarian support, or to allow for the safe evacuation of civilians. Two fold measures, one, the stopping of all military operations in rafah, and to allow for the axis of the united nations fact-finding mission in rafah as well. Clearly a message from the world court that israel has to do more, must do more, and that things have not approved -- improved since they last ordered israel to do so. Now the bigger question is a bit more complicated. Although these are legally binding orders they are not legally enforceable. The international court of justice says that palestine does not have a police force to enforce these orders. What they can do, or what the un can do is have the security council pass resolutions to sanction israel, force embargoes on israel and have enforcement actions on these orders, but those can be vetoed by the united states. So crucially the relationship between israel and washington dc is not crucial going forward. >> Reporter: as you are speaking, alex -- alex, allegedly hamas has issued a statement, saying that they are urging the security council to implement the icj ruling. Let us move away from the icj for a moment and turn to the icc, where the lead prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant for the israeli prime minister and other top israeli officials, as other -- as well as other members of hamas leadership. Let us talk about the increasing international pressure, presumably, where you are as well, we can hear that screaming, and all the pressure on israel? >> Certainly diplomatic pressure, we have heard spain, ireland and norway saying in a matter of days they will recognize palestinian states. Slovenia and belgium and others should follow suit. But crucially germany and france say the conditions have not been met to recognize palestine as a state, and that remains a big issue. The international criminal court requestinghose arrest warrants , and that decision will be made in a couple of months. That would mean that prime minister netanyahu, defence minister gallant, would not be able to travel to 124 countries around the world, including canada and most of the european union states as well for fear of being arrested. Now also the leadership of hamas , the leaders of hamas who organized the atrocities of october seventh are as well subject to those arrest warrants. But you are right to say that there is a building diplomatic pressure. Perhaps one difference is the new dutch government that will be formed in the next few days, and they seem to be more supportive of israel than the previous one. Globally speaking, more pressure on israel to do more, but there are se excepti >> Natasha: alex caddy eight, at the hague. Thank you. Let us get closer to the actual war. Let us go to gaza, where the israeli army says they have retrieved the bodies of three more hostages killed during the october 7th attack by hamas militants. The military says the recovery was part of a special operation in northern gaza which had seen erce fighting in recent days. Irris makler joins us now from jerusalem. She is tracking not part of the story. What do we know at this stage?

All right here. Subscribe now atCRAVE.CA. >> This is certainly a surprise to us, but just at depths of need right across the country that unfortunately is not being met with a sense of urgency. Canada has reached a critical turning point as more people are struggling with poverty and food insecurity. >> That was on for too many events. That was not too many things and the person were there. >> 3 young males, including a 15 year-old boy are dead after being stabbed in a fight in montreal. He says at the start and important state. I'm from dallas tonight. Ireland, norway and spain plan to formally recognize a palestinian state move, angering israel. But a welcome by hamas. You're watching ctv news channel. I'm roger petersen. Thank you very much for joining us. >> Well, some sobering numbers when it comes to food insecurity in canada, in its annual poverty report. Cards. Food banks. Canada warns that we have reached a critical point as poverty and food insecurity worsened in every corner of the country. Canada received an overall grade of d minus. That's a drop from the d last year, only to provinces nova scotia and prince edward island managed to improve the rest of the country remain stagnant or worsened. >> Putting together housing plan, looking at yours, social assistance or benefits rates, making sure their indexed to inflation so that people are falling further and further behind into poverty. And then what we're suggesting for provinces that don't and put together a coordinated poverty reduction plan with with target so that you can hold your government to account and citizens can see that your government is taking action. Digging deeper into the numbers. The report found that more than 44% of people are feeling worse off when compared to last year. >> The percentage of people paying more than 30% of their income on housing hit 43.6% in 2024. Joining us now to discuss this further is neil hetherington, the ceo of the daily bread food bank. Neil, thank you for joining us. Unfortunately, you have to join us. >> Unfortunately, this is yet another it's an academic report that showing very clearly what we're feeling on the ground every single day here at the daily bread food bank here in toronto. >> How do we bring about change? I mean, we hear these reports after report after report. What do we do? >> Well, I think that's the frustrating part to us here at the food bank is we know the policy we know what is going on in the city and in the country. A it is a failing mark canadians overall are feeling financially worse off about 50% are financially worse off the year prior than they are this year. And we we know the policy alternatives, we know that it's, there is a lack of affordable housing income supports are not keeping pace and precarious employment is on the rise. >> Now we were seeing from 2021. The usage is up 50% of food banks. Where's that coming from? Is it to people, some people who are already destitute, are they just getting used to be using the food bank's accepted as part of their life or is it are more and more people being driven into situations where they have to turn to you. >> You know, it's, it's new people every single unfortunately are welcoming about 12 to 13,000 torontonians who have never used a food bank before are coming to the food bank for the very first time on a monthly basis. We're growing at 3 to 5% here in city of toronto, each every single month. This past april, there were 311,000 client visits up from about 60,000 and pre-pandemic. So the numbers continue to escalate. And you asked, you know, importantly, who's coming to the food bank individuals more than 50% to have a employment. And yet they can't make ends meet largely because of inflation that has started to, to taper moose. I'm very, very pleased to see the numbers that came out last week or so showing that inflation is under 3%. On the right trajectory >> How are you keeping up in toronto with this, with this growing demand? Well, it's not we're keeping up because there's incredible volunteers. There's a wonderful network of

agencies were responding to the call. But I got to tell you, rodger, the there is a growing sense of concern and a growing sense of frustration we have for year after year said there are clear policy alternatives that need to be implemented. Policies like the canada disability where if we, you know, just invested in that type of a program. We have the possibility of lifting up about a million and half canadians out of into a situation where they might thriving community. We know the policy solutions, we just need to have the governments at all levels have the fortitude and courage be able to implement them. And how would that work? That policy changes like to see. >> Well, yeah, I mean, when it comes to the canada disability benefit, we were very hopeful that it would be fully funded, meaning that somebody who currently is on disability in ontario, they receive about $1300 federally. There is to be a better $1000 top up to that. So they could at least be at the poverty the I was pleased to see in the federal budget, the re emphasis on affordable housing. So making sure that we are back building affordable housing and making sure that their rent supplements in place. And then I think provincially there are a whole host of measures to to start to decrease precarious employment to many people come to the food bank have full-time working, but are unable to have that allow them to be able to thriving community. We talk about the government helping out what the private sector do. >> Well, I think the private sector in a more often than not looking to to making sure that they are paying living wages. So not just minimum wage, but living wages so that their employees can have a decent place to live in the community that they're, they're working. You're right, it's not just a full exercise, but they ultimately have a duty of care to make sure that everybody's right to housing and everybody's right to food is realized so that food banks like the daily bread, food bank and food banks, canada all across the country can start to see the lineups decrease rather than the trajectory that they're currently on. >> And I mean, I know you do what you focus on and which is one of the most expensive cities in the world. But this is also an issue in smaller towns and and smaller municipalities. >> Abs, absolutely. And they don't have the same supports that we might have in a in larger urban areas. I mean, you just have to look at what's on the screen right now, right across the country. We're seeing, you know, a lot of red, we're seeing, you know, seasoned ease across the country when it comes to investments in affordable housing, when it comes to making sure that people have that a decent incomes, making sure that we've got an economy that allows businesses to thrive so that they can pay those living wages. >> Ok neal, thank you very much for joining us today. Always appreciate it. Neil hetherington is the ceo of the daily bread food bank. We're also getting a better sense of how canadians feel about the state of grocery prices in canada. The majority believe costs at stores are still climbing. A new leger poll found 29% blame the ryman rising costs on grocery chains who they believe are attempting to increase their profit margins. Senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at dalhousie university. Sylvain charlebois says he's not surprised. >> People have less money to spend on too. And they feel they feel desperate. And so they're looking to blame something, someone and he's is seeing ad to the one component, the supply chain that most people understand is the grocery store. But food inflation is much more complicated than that. But I'm not surprised to see the anger. The collective anger from some people out there. >> The federal government has introduced a voluntary code of conduct for major grocers to trying to promote fairness and transparency in the industry. Canada's biggest grocer loblaw has signed on industry minister francois-philippe champagne says he is hopeful others will follow suit. >> Seeing that inflation is going down. Why we have in recent years with respect to loblaw signing on it's a step in the right we have been in touch with walmart and costco and I'm hopeful that he will sign and that's, you know, if you talk grocers of kind of one of the key step to stabilize prices in canada. So we're going to keep about what we're going to keep on working with that. But I'm hopeful that everyone in the >> And frustration over high grocery prices pumped prompted a boycott of loblaw own stores this month. Now organizers say the protest we'll go beyond may 1st. According to the organizers, people supporting the boycott want to keep the movement going a release as the boycotters find a focus on advocacy efforts in the months ahead. Emily johnson is one of the key organizers and says the boycott has been a uniting moment for community members.

>> Ideally, what we wanted to do was just raise awareness of the drastically increasing cost of groceries means, you know, the fact that we do have control and power as consumers we never imagined in a million years that we had today. You know, 80,000 members on our subreddit own and and that there are 20,000 members between should kochan are instagram, it's its and we're just incredibly surprised by the viral atf. It. >> Well, a lot has pushed back against criticism of the company, saying it's not responsible for higher food prices. The canadian grocery chain has been expanding its discount stores to accommodate for the higher prices. And a live look in london, 10 downing street where we're waiting to hear from british prime minister rishi sunak's. He will be delivering a statement outside that famous store there likely announcing a summer general election. We'll take you there live when the prime minister speaks. Norway, spain and ireland have announced their intention to formally recognize a palestinian state, a declaration that would take effect on tuesday spoken with a number of of the heaters and counterparts. >> I'm confident that for other countries will join us and taking this important step in the coming weeks. >> Leaders from the 3 countries say they hope the move brings new momentum toward a 2 state solution, adding it's not a decision against israel or in favour of hamas, but instead one in support of peace. Israel reacted angrily to the move, calling the decision distorted. >> Israel claims that this is a reward to hamas. And I suggested it is not a reward ice who has no interest in 2 states, has no interest in the continuation of israel's existence. It's, it's a reward to moderates in the palestinian authority who already cooperate with israel. >> Israel has now recalled its ambassadors to ireland, norway and spain and some of their envoys. Hamas, meantime, welcomed the news news and is calling on other nations to follow suit. Meanwhile, in rafah, food distribution has been suspended due to a lack of supplies and insecurity. That according to the united nations. Well, prime minister trudeau says he is sticking by house speaker greg fergus, despite another controversy. We have full confidence in rexburg fergus as a. >> As a speaker, that is a common says a, a independent minded leader. The was dealt with was addressed by the party and by the house leader. It was unfortunate mistake. >> The issue is an invitation to a quote, summer evening with greg fergus and also referenced reckless policies of the conservatives, both conservative and bloc mp's are calling on fergus to step down. Ctv news political commentator scott reid says he doesn't see the attacks on fergus stopping anytime soon. Greg fergus is never going to moment's peace as speaker, he will be under constant fire. The conservatives opposed him when he was a candidate for speaker. >> They have pounced on the stakes city is made and they've made it clear that even in instances like this, where the mistake wasn't really his, they're going to hold him to account. So I think you're going to see great for guests on the grill over and over and over again. >> Let's go back to london now, where british prime minister rishi sunak is making a statement. >> I stood behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building behind me. I told you that we faced a generation defining moment and that we as a society would not be judged by some government action. >> But by the small acts of kindness that we showed, one of us. You met that challenge. And then some and I have never been proud to be british. When I introduce the follows skate. I did so not because I saw rick country simply in need of desperate help, little bit. We want. But because ice or a country, his future hung in the balance. I could be bold interest in the 10's of millions of you at home, that you would rise to the moment or I could accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth, it was no choice at all. I have never and will never leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days. Ally and you do that because you've seen it. I was like did that. I will forever do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it's easy to forget the scale of what we've been through. We were hit by pandemic upended

normal life. Who would have thought that the government would have to tell us how many times a day we could leave odds. Then just as we were recovering from covid full return to europe. With putin's invasion of ukraine energy bill spiring. I came to office the bubble to restore economic stability economic stability is the bedrock of any future success. Whether that is rising wages and good jobs investment in our public services. All the defensive, the country. And because of all collective sacrifice and your homework. We have reached 2 major milestones in delivering that stability. Showing that when we work together, anything as possible. Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted. Outpacing germany, france and the united states. >> And this morning, it was confirmed that inflation is back to normal. This means that the pressure on price israelis and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and parties I set out on work. I recognize that it is not always been easy. Some of you with any just be starting to feel the benefit. And for some, it might still be hard. When you look at your bank balance. But this hold and economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The question now is how and who do you trust to time that foundation into a secure future for you, your family and our country. Is the moment for britain to choose its future. To decide whether we want to build on the progress we have made risk going back to square one with no plan and no certainty. And today I spoke with his majesty, the king to request the dissolution of parliament. The king has grown to this request. We will have a general election on the 4th of july. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold. Putin's russia is waging a brutal war in ukraine and will not stop there. If he succeeds. That war is also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the middle east. The forces of business to extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and a volatile society here at heart. China, it's looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a leading technology. And migration is being weaponized by a stall states threatened the integrity of our. These uncertain times cool for a clip. Lot bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has stopped. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children. I cannot and will not play. We have got everything right. No government. I'm proud of what we have achieved together. The bold actions we have taken. I'm confident about what we can do in the future. We've tackled inflation controlled at caldwell cuts taxes and increase the state pension by 900 pounds. We've reduced taxes on investment, can seize the opportunities of brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow the business. That record amounts of funding into our nhs and ensure it is now trading. The doctors in the U.S. says it needs in the decades to come. We've reformed education and our children. Now the best returns in the west. We parts always energy security and your family finances over environmental do in our approach. And that's their right. We fully funded an increase in defence spending to 2 and a half percent of gdp. We made a decision to invest more in local transport you actually use rather than endlessly plow more money into hs 2. We set out a comprehensive plan to reform our welfare system to make it fast for those who pay for it as well as those who need it. Immigration is finally coming down and we all stopping the boats with our one departments. We will ensure that the next generation gross out smoke-free. I hope that my work since I became prime minister. Shows that we have apply and all for pat to take bold action necessary for all countries to flourish. I stuck with that plan and always been honest with you about what is needed, even when that's been difficult. Because I'm guided by doing what is right for our country. Not what is easy. I can say the same thing for the labour party. Because I don't know what. And in truth. I don't think, you know, ina. And that's because they have to plan. There is no action. And as a result, the future can only be on site. And with that. On the 5th of july and the

customer on will be prime minister. He has shown time and time again that he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made to become lately that once he got the job. How can you know that he would do exactly the same thing if he were to become prime minister. If you don't have the conviction to stick to anything you say. If you don't have the courage to tell people what you want to do. And if you don't have a plan. How can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times. Over the next few weeks. I will fight for every vote I will on your trust. I will prove to you. Only a conservative government led by me. Will not put a hold and economic stability at risk. Can restore pride and confidence in our country. And with a clear plan and bold action will deliver a secure future for you. Your family and our united kingdom. >> And you've been watching british prime minister rishi sunak standing outside of 10 downing street to announce that there will be a general election on july 4th. Now the conservatives have been saying for some time, it was going to be too early back end of the year, that they would have this election said they're announcing it for july. The 4th. It is a and has it happened at a time when his party is trailing the labour party. They're way behind in the polls. According to that end, even cirnac is struggling with his within his party. He took over only a year and a half ago. We have more coming (Dramatic music) (Cheering) I've got good news. There is a murderer - Oh! - walking among us. [gasps] Fantastic! I'm sorry, what?

To drake us our reputation through the mud. >> And 2 brand us as a criminals and we have not been charged with any crimes on november 10, 2 officers were called to the yorkville area at bay and bloor. >> Posters were glued to the doors and windows of an indigo bookstore and red paint had been splattered. The 11 accused had all been charged with multiple offences, including mischief over $5,000. Allegations of of postering in paint don't even meet the standard set out by the court of appeal for mischief. >> There is an important case called jeffers that encourage people to read it discusses the importance of how how posters in our communities are used for free expression expression by people. In response, the crown attorney's office says >> This decision should not be seen as a criticism of the police determination that there were reasonable grounds for the arrests of these 4 individuals. However, the standard for proceeding with a prosecution is properly higher and more rigorous. The indigo bookstore has been the subject of boycott campaigns for years over its founders has stick foundation for loans. Soldiers advocates say calling out the company is a form of activism against a foundation which offers scholarships to people without family in israel, who nevertheless served in the israeli military as jews, we say calling out companies that support israeli war crimes is a legitimate form of protest targeting indigo is not antisemitic. >> Lawyers for the 7 people who are still being prosecuted are calling for all charges to be dropped.

The victims include a 15-year-old and two others age 23 and 25. Cbc's reporter has more from montreal. >> Reporter: what police are essentially saying today is we know that it was about 15-16 people, who were part of this altercation. And the big piece of news that we have is that police are saying that it is not linked to gang violence. But that it is just a personal conflict between these people. But police are not really giving much more details than that. Which know this happened around 7:00 P.M. last night in montreal. But aside from that, they say they really are still investigating. They're trying to identify all the people who are at the scene. Trying to identify witnesses. Trying to get camera footage of the area. But they're still very much in the early stages of this investigation. And trying to figure out where to go from here. They say they have one or two suspects, but they say at this point, no one has been arrested. It's simply too early in the investigation. >> Natasha: cbc reporter in montreal. >>> The head of quebecor is calling on the federal government to intervene on the deal between loblaws. The owner says the deal would push the company out of loblaws stores. Cbc's janyce McGREGOR reports. >> Reporter: if you shopped in an loblaws-owned store, you may have seen the mobile shop kiosks. They're independent. They market themselves as not a affiliated with any telecom company. Saying they don't pick favorites. Saying they work for consumers in their promotional materials. As you say, they're located across canada. They are now accused by the head of quebecor of engaging in some behaviour to try to shutout certain carriers from those shops. Pierre carl palado's letter to industry minister champaign says he's become aware of a new deal that would see these stores in grocery stores only carry products from rogers and bell. They have worked together on a joint venture called glen tell. And in the future, it apparently will have a supply contract so that the mobile shop only includes their products and their services. We remember, of course, freedom mobile, the quebecor kind of brand of cell service, it has only been a part of video tron québec for the last year. It was previously part of shaw communications. Shaw had to divest, sell it off as part of its merger with rogers. The intent was for quebecor to run a forced national cell phone carrier. It made a equipment to keep prices low in western canada and ontario to expand its 5g infrastructure to give consumers more choice. But if they're going to be shutout of certain shops, palado's point is will that come to pass? The telecom shop tells cbc, it only accounts for 5% of the total sales of phones and cell phone plans in canada. It says because it has an only limited market presence, it doesn't think decisions it might make about, you know, its suppliers necessarily affects competition in the sector on a national scale. It says it does continue to offer a range of options to its customers. But, you know, the concern here is that that range has shrunk with this new deal. >> Natasha: so in palado's's letter he's directing the minister champaign. What actions could the federal government take? >> Reporter: what are the minister's powers and limitations? He was stopped on his way into the liberal's national caucus meeting on parliament hill this morning and here's what he had to say. >> That's a question for the competition bureau. A letter should be addressed to the competition bureau and as you know we give them the powers to fully conduct the ministry investigation. >> Reporter: are you saying you have no power? >> It's the competition that has the power. >> Reporter: it's impacted because the minister does not direct the investigations that the competition bureau might choose to undertake. It's possible -- >> Natasha: we're going to interrupt janyce and take you to london, england, where the

british prime minister is making an announcement. >> As I stand as your prime minister, I can't help to reflect my first proper introduction was over fours ago. I sat behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building. I told you we face a generation-defining moment and we as a society would not be judged as government action but the small acts of kindness we show one another. You met that challenge and then some. I have never been prouder to be british. When I introduced the following scheme, I did so not because I saw a country simply in need of desperate help. Albeit, we were. But because I saw a country whose future hung in the balance. I could be bold and trust in the tens of millions of you at home you could rise to the movement or accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth, it was no choice at all. I have never and will never leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days alone. And you know that because you've seen it. I will do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it's easy to forget the scale of what we've been through. We were hit by a pandemic that upended normal life. Who would have thought the government would tell us how many times a day we could leave our homes? Just as we were recovering from covid, war returned to europe with putin's war on ukraine sent your energy fills skyrocketing. I came to office to restore economic stability, the bedrock of future success. Whether that is rising wages and good jobs, investment in our public services, or the defence of the country. And because of our collective sacrifice and your hard work, we have reached two major milestones in delivering that stability. Showing that when we work together, anything is possible. Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted, out pacing germany, france and U.S. and this morning, it was confirmed inflation is back to normal. This means the pressure on prices is relieved and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and priorities I set out are working. I recognise that it's not always been easy. Some of you will only just be starting to feel the benefits. For some, it might still be hard when you look at your bank balance. But this hard-earned economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The question now is how and who do you trust to turn that foundation into a secure future for you, your family, and our country? Now, it's a moment for britain to choose its future. To decide whether we want to build on the progress we've made oris can going back to square one with no plan and no certainty. Earlier today, I spoke with his majesty the king to request the dissolution of parliament. The king granted this request and we will have the general election on the 4th of july. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold war. Putin's russia is waging a brutal war in ukraine and will not stop there if he succeeds. That war made it too clear the risk to our energy security. In the middle east, the forces of extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are ex-employeded by extremist who seek to undermine our values and define our society at home. China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead in technology. And migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times, call for a clear plan. And bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has that plan. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children. Now I cannot and will not play the we have got everything right. No government should. But I am proud of what we've achieved together. The bold actions we have taken, the confidence about what we can do in the future. We've tackled inflation, controlled debt, cut workers' taxes, and increased state pension by 900 pounds. We've reduced taxes on investments and seized the opportunity for brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow a business. But record amounts of funding into our N.H.S. ensure it's training the doctors and nurses it needs to the decades to come. We've reformed education in our

children and are now the best readers in the western world. We prioritized energy security and family finances over environmental dogma in our approach to net-zero. We fully funded increase in defence spending to 2.5% of G.D.P. we made a decision to invest more in local transport so you use rather than endlessly pile more money into H.S. 2. We set out a plan to reform welfare system to make it fair for those who pay for it and those who need it. Immigration, is finally coming down. We're stopping the boats with our rwanda partnership. And we will ensure that the next generation grows up smoke-free. I hope that my work since I became prime minister shows we have a plan and are prepared to take bold action necessary for our countries to flourish. I stopped with that plan and always been honest with you about what is needed even when that has been difficult because I'm guided by doing what is right for our country, not what is easy. I can't say the same thing for the labour party. Because I don't know what they offer. In truth, I don't think you know either. That's because they have no plan. There is no bold action. And as a result, a future can only be uncertain with them. On the 5th of july -- or I will be prime minister. He has shown time and again he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made once he became leader once you got the job, how do you know he won't do the same thing if he were to become prime minister? If you don't have the conviction to stick to anything you say, if you don't have the courage to tell people what you want to do, and if you don't have a plan, how can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times? Over the next few weeks, I will fight for every vote. I will earn your trust, and I will prove to you that only a conservative government, led by me, will not put our hard-earned economic stability at risk. Can restore pride and confidence in our country. And with a clear plan and bold action, will deliver a secure future for you, your family, and our united kingdom. >> Natasha: okay. Folks, we've been taking you live to a rainy london. And that was british prime minister rishi sunak confirming what many of us were keeping he would say. There's going to be a general election in the U.K. an election day is going to be on july 4th. Let's bring in cbc's julia chapman, who was watching alongside at our london bureau. Julia, it's such a british scene powering down on the prime minister. And very punk rock. I don't know if it was a coincidence or someone was trying to drown him out. A huge mood-setter. Tell us what we should anticipate. >> Reporter: it's the news we were anticipating. It's against the backdrop of protesters. Rishi sunak confirms there will be a U.K. general election on july 4th. He's taken the decision to go early when it comes to calling this election. He had a few more months until he would have been forced to do so. Five years into this parliament. So there is certainly now a big campaign gaining momentum in the next six weeks as rishi sunak tries to paint the conservative party as the party of stability and he pointed to some of what he sees as the party's achievements over the last few years. Indeed, the conservative party has been in power for 14 years. He's the fifth prime minister during that time to run the united kingdom. He talked about the furlough scheme that he oversaw when he was a chancellor, the country's finance minister, during the covid period. How it helped people who were out of work to stay afloat. He pointed to his policy of trying to phase out smoking, a policy moving through parliament and will have to be rushed through in order to be approved before this election. Polls put him 20 points behind the labour party. He took aim at labour. Saying he doesn't know what the party stands for and he doesn't think the electorate does either. The leader will spend the next

And the broadway subway extension project is also delayed by a year, now expected the province says the delays are related to covid-19 and worldconflicts. However, critics say these delays a other projects. >> Speaker: the problem is every time they are behind schedule or over budget or both, that restricts other capital projects from being undertaken with a hit to our deficit which will be warmed by the rating agencies and we are going to see higher borrowing costs which we can the projects to be built, capital projects it n be under right now. >> Jennifer: at this point the both projects are unclear.

We'll get perspective coming up. And we're seeing a rebound in the major markets right now, particularly lead by the nasdaq after yesterday's. Sound off, it was 2 days in a row. So we are bouncing back from these levels. Cannon hall law will get great perspective from billionaireinvestor ken fisher. He's got his eye on the long game and they'll tell us about the best buys in the market right now.

How business pastor generations and get the view of the beauty landscape and how it evolves during economic cycles. But first, here's a look at some of the top stories we're tracking for you right here in the bnn bloomberg newsroom. Canada's competition watchdog has launched investigations into the parent companies of loblaws and sobeys. The competition bureau alleges that the grocery chains engaged in anti-competitive conduct and you so-called property controls to limit grocery competition. Sobeys owner empire is called the inquiry unlawful. Loblaw and empire are 2 of the 3 major grocery canadian players.

Willie's weight-loss and diabetes treatments generated more than 2 billion dollars in sales in the 1st quarter of this year. Let's take a look at this recovery day. It's pretty broad based 10 of the 11 sectors are moving higher, everything but telcos. And as we take a look at the tone south of the border, decisively positive except for the dow here here, too. We do have a broad based recovery when it comes to the sectors. Yesterday, the dow plunging largely on weakness in boeing, boeing's recovering little bit. It's up about one percent. But today, the key drag coming from salesforce, the stock down about 3% knocking 52 points off the index. (Funky hip hop music) well, about 5 months into the year and already investors are sitting on some pretty tidy gains. 12 and a half percent for the nasdaq, 7% nearly for the tsx. It may leave you wondering, can the gains can continue because when you average out how these in indices perform every year, we're about at average performance with the rest of the year. Still to go, our next guest says that's maybe not the right way to look at things. Let's bring in ken fisher is executive chair and co-chief investment officer of fisher investments. And can you make this great point that averaging doesn't necessarily tell you the story of what is truly happening. Year over year. >> Thanks for having me back on amber. I do appreciate only on 3 weeks ago in field really lucky the day. The reality is often. Averages mislead in this case. And I wrote about this in global mail column. The fact is that history I were you look at it, america, europe, canada o all slightly different, basically that averages are made of extreme

years. Years close to the average, just don't happen very years. You get some down years, you get very few being down years. But the average year is for the s&p 500 ever just 10%. Go back to 1925 little over. That's a long way to think about it. Logically, you know, g bull market or mine bear market. Well, if you're a bull market, you want to, expect returns that would be normal to a bull market. And they are, they average over 20%, almost anywhere in the developed typically low 20's. So if you think about a last year, i-20 the 20's. That would be normal market. And so we're a bull market now and we're actually do the year and we're average numbers and we still a ways to run because it's a bull market. Yeah, I think that's the kind of so what of, of crunching these numbers is, don't get spooked by the numbers. >> You've seen so far this year because there can be a lot more there. And then it goes to what is underpinning that view that the bull market can continue. Is it that? >> Growth remains generally robust. And even though rates are elevated, seems like a lot of these companies can make a good go of it. >> So it just got back from. We go back to look at the 2022 bomber. Central banks had got near to finish raising rates. 10. Depending on where you are in the world. Markets at a bottom between september between july and september. When you think about october, when you think about that. So banks said euro bank almost every where they're still hiking rates at a pretty good clip. The fed was still doing. 75 beats a clip and the markets going up anyway. Fact of the matter is where moose, the market is current expectations for future reality. And the reality has been that the economy normal growth economy a little on the low side, yes, connelly implosion, the lockdowns in bounces back in a way above average rate of 6% average annual pass almost everywhere. Percent america and then it starts slowly descending back to normal. And we've had pretty much normal gdp growth rates in the developed world, a little below that still feels abnormal. Everything's that post covid fields have a normal and makes people more negative incentive. That is the jon templeton famously said bull markets are born on pessimism. Grow on skepticism, mature on optimism. And I I knew for ian were far so I'd like to ask you that in the context of ai you have seen and you think so deeply about the markets there certainly. >> Areas that can get ahead of themselves. What do you make of the frenzy for artificial intelligence, how much it makes up the broad market and whether it is creating a bit of a distortion. I think that's. >> Home perception. That's wrong. Let me help you with that. Look at all of the countries around the world hit new highs this year or 15 year highs this year. They little to no tech in the middle. Britain. Trump's germany. Denmark. Not a new all-time high, but a 15 year high in spain, you can go down the mountain of the netherlands. Also, it's got some tech but you can go to see that bull market is much broader than people think. But all the countries that don't have. Much any initative all-time highs in this cycle and this year and the last couple months. >> And then we can add to that list as driven by commodities. What do you make of the commodity rally? Does it make sense to you? I am not a good forecast. Commodity. >> They're inherently bowl, but of course, that's not good or bad. And the reality the features last few years also made them a little wacky. And I would hazard a forecast there. I do think and I have said and I wrote a column on this that energy is going to be strong as this year progresses started off. Well, and I think it will continue on the back half of the year because producers have the introduction of new supply coming on in overtime that haul prices sport fossil fuels. Back up to high end of

their last year's range. And then an environment where. Energy prices go up, but don't go through the roof. The big mega drillers do really that's a view on energy. I want to take you back. I asked ai and whacked asked directly broader tech sector just is, is that an area that you see can continue going higher. >> The answer is yes. And the reality is, we're in a very good environment for but let me just say every market, some parts speed and some parts ai and this time obviously leading big tech. Is the world doing well, smaller having more problems there growing, but not overly robust growth economy is perfect for companies that actually can grow in a fairly low growth environment is one of the reasons why growth stocks, including parts of growth that our tech are doing well going back yearly to ai. I want to make a point about macro sentiment tied to that. If you think about the jon templeton phrases, I said when you get into that euphoria it's not about singles of big companies that are strong in their category. It's about I banking world creating garbage to flow into the market, place the ipos and otherwise to take advantage of the euphoric money. And when you get euphoria, pick up in ipos in ipos of substantial quality can do get that, but that's okay. It's part of the world that we're creating some dream for those who are malicious euphoric and want have some hopes and dreams or something much more than a piece of paper garbage. And we haven't seen that. That's what we had some of which spots. >> You're absolutely right. So that's insight that maybe we're not quite at that euphoria you picked up on something you said about these growth stocks. And I think those that are more value oriented. If you look at it, you know, plain vanilla s&p value index for says that growth index, it has been underperforming. You know, when when did the valley investors get a break? >> Put that into perspective for you this way. Because earlier just a few moments ago, he talked about how the dow done so well relative to let's the s&p 500 nasdaq, which you know that in the s&p 500 at all, intraday all-time high yesterday and nasdaq's doing better still why and when. Best time for the value side is when growth picks up. Central banks cut short relative to long rates little down the road from here. Why is it true? Was always the most important questions or you're fundamentally correct in the y on the rate cutting part is because that impacts banks propensity to went win short rates fall long-term rates. Banks were in the core business of taking huge return to positive basin, making long-term loans get more eager to land and the easiest to win or the value companies. They weren't lending too much before or otherwise. Substantive companies as lending comes true real in the world, the value companies become more growth like and actually in really well in the market, the time to see that is with a lag 2. Central banks cutting rates. Well, it sure goes a long rich richard free market senate and it has the global economy continues to improve. >> Now I know you said, you know, like to forecast commodities, I know you don't like to hang your hat too much on interest rates and speculate on when they're going to cut. Are they going >> So you know, I outside portland, oregon for a long and it's like in america to centre of illegal drugs being legal. You get a kind illegal drug, you only leader and you are down the street downtown 10 o'clock in the more you do have freak. Just coming up to you crazy things and you don't want to be close to those people because a crazy because you can't predict what they say and that's what I think the central you know, people that are just crazy. Most central bank and eurobank the did crazy. And when you try to predict what crazy people too. >> Care I'm going to leave it on that analogy. That was beautiful. Thank you very much. That's ken fisher joining the executive chair and co-chief investment officer at fisher investments. We're going to take a quick break when we come back. We're tracking shares of gildan, a stunning resignation of the board and the ceo glenn. Sure mandy, back as ceo. But does that mean if you're a shareholder will find out when

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Just maybe you want to bolster what I was just saying, julia, what stood out to you as you listened to what the president was laying out there. >> Perhaps not a big surprise with the verdict but still a stark assessment of the situation in gaza, particularly since israel started its offensive in rafah. Just a couple of weeks ago. And the deterioration as the president of the international court was painting a picture of a very difficult situation in terms of the humanitarian conditions on the ground, and he was referencing particularly the facts that there had been evacuation orders issued in advance by israel, warning that it was going into rafah, that led to the displacement of some 800,000 people, according to the united nations. And what I think was interesting from this ruling was the fact that the judges found that that wasn't good enough, the fact that there had been advance warning. They said that the situation to where -- where the people had been moved to simply wasn't good enough, they were living without roofs, without water, without any kind of sanitary conditions, and of course very limited access to aid, which is why the icj has made its judgment that the rafah crossing needs to be reopened. We've been hearing major concerns about the fact that since israel took control of the gaza side of that crossing, there hasn't been any aid coming from egypt into gaza over the last couple of weeks. And although there are other routes and israel has insisted that it isn't blocking aid, that's been a major sticking point for aid groups where we heard the judges talking about the world food program, not having access to a warehouse in rafah as well. So a really stark picture of what's going on there, but, yes, the headlines effectively that the court is ordering israel to halt its rafah offensive, open the rafah crossing and allow investigators in to ensure that israel is complying with an order from earlier in the year by the icj that it meets to prevent a genocide in gaza. >> Heather: just again, getting a little bit of context to all of this, again, ordering the stop to the rafah incursion, some had expected the icj could go even further and order a stop to the entire wars the entire offensive in gaza broadly, that has not happened, nor did it happen with the initial ruling back in january. So this is rafah specific. Interesting that the votes in all of these were 13-2, and the american representative on the international court who's a justice by the name of sarah haul cleveland, she voted were the majority, so she voted in favour of these provisional measures. In terms of the southwestern ontario come of this, this is legally bind bug there is no power to enforce these orders from the international court of justice. By way of understanding, this is brought by south africa, it's part of the larger case, south africa alleges that israel has been involved in acts of genocide. It filed that back last december and this is part of what's making its way through the international court of justice. The main case which deals with that main accusation of genocide it's not expected to start until next we are. Israel has of course denied the case, but this is part of that within what is being investigated and that's part of the, as you said, julia, must be open to any investigators lookings at some of these allegations and looking for evidence. So this is the context to the ruling today. We already know, again, not able to be enforced, israel has already made it clear it will nod adhere to this, whatever it was going to be. No power on earth will stop israel from protecting its citizens and going after hamas in gaza. That's what a government spokesperson has already said. So what is this likely to lead to, as far as israel's response, and I would also like you to look, julia, if you could, to how the world will respond, the kind of isolation, the kind of criticism that we may hear as a result of what the icj has just ruled. >> Well, absolutely. I mean, israel did defend itself at the court last week because it is a member of the united nations and it has to effectively put forward its rebuttal to the south african allegations, so certainly it has been participating in these proceedings and although they are legally binding, as you say, incredibly difficult to enforce on the ground, south africa continuing to press israel on its actions in gaza and although the broader genocide case could take many years, it wants to see pressure put on israel at every stage, particularly as the situation on the ground is evolving. Certainly, we have seen israel already dismiss international courts' efforts to intervene in gaza, saying that israel didn't start this war, it didn't want this war, and it needs to carry out its offensive, it says, in rafah because it's -- the last stronghold of hamas. It says that's necessary to route out hammond every hamas.

certainly that has been its perspective, and although it will be difficult to enforce this, there does add to a growing sense of pressure and isolation on israel, there have been many countries expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza and specifically about the situation in rafah as well which the united states warned against this offensive, although we heard a couple of days ago that the U.S. said no red lines had been crossed there so far. But it does certainly -- verdicts like this, judgments like the icj's judgment today do add to that pressure and help shape the international response, for example, in russia when the icj ruled that its invasion of ukraine was unlawful, that certainly added some legal weight to many countries giving weapons to ukraine. So that is the kind of picture we are expecting going forward there. Could be stronger responses from western countries as this situation in gaza continues. >> We already had, as you and I were talking about, the three countries, spain, ireland and norway going ahead to declare that they will declare an official palestinian state as of next week. Again, as part of this international pressure and growing international condemnation. Julia, thank you. I will let you go for now. Julia chapman going to continue watching the story out of our bureau in london. And as we return to the scenes outside, we do see a small group of pro-palestinian demonstrators. We would expect reaction to come to this judgment from the international court of justice. What we've seen previously is the lawyers for south africa will respond and also the legal team for israel as well. But julia raises a number of questions, what will come of all of this? Will there be suddenly today or increasingly international condemnation? Will any countries go to the point of new sanctions and will there be, as some have been concerned about from the israeli perspective, will this then lead the united nations security council to declare some new form of declaration which would then require the united states to use its veto power in support of israel in all of this? There are many diplomatic and political repercussions to come even if there is no power to enforce this decision just out from the international court of justice.

Cbc News Explore. >> Under the genocide convention, as israel must immediately halt its military offences and any other action in the rafah -- >> Breaking this hour, as you just heard live on cbc morning live, the united nations international court of justice has ordered israel to halt its offensive, its incursion into rafah, which began earlier this month. The icj has ordered israel to keep the rafah border crossing open, to allow investigators access to the gaza territory, and to report back on the measures israel has taken in one month's time. This is all in response to a request from south africa for a cease-fire, the court's ruling is legally binding, but the icj cannot enforce it and israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. >> Outrage over the war in gaza continues to spark strong reaction and protest in this country. A pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto's main campus has just over six hours left to respond to the school's latest bid to end the demonstration. Meagan fitzpatrick is on campus today. >> The university publicly released the offer that has been presented to students at around :30 yesterday. So it outlines the proposed responses to the protesters' demands. When it comes to the students' demands around u of t divesting from companies that support the israeli military, that's one of the demands of the students, not to have any university money invested in those kinds of companies, the university is proposing to set up an advisory committee to do a review of the university's investments, essentially and that advisory committee would be made up of students and staff and faculty and alumni and they are saying representatives from the encampment can suggest membership on that committee and that committee would be asked to report back to the president by no later than the end of october. Also on the students' demand for more disclosure around the university's investments, the school is proposing to set up a working group to look at that, looking at ways of increasing transparency around investments, and that group would be asked to report back by mid july. On the protesters' demand around u of t cutting academic ties with some israeli institutions, the university on that point is essentially saying that's a no go, that the university rejects that demand, saying they will not terminate any partnerships with israeli universities or engage in any academic boycotts. They say they will continue to look at ways of increasing opportunities for palestinian scholars here at the university of toronto. So those are sort of the bare bones of some of the offer that the school is presenting to the protesters. In terms of the timing & this offer now, here's a bit of what the u of. It's president merrick gardener said about that. >> It's also clear that many members of our community feel increasing distress by the presence of the encampment. They feel unsafe, they have reported feelings of -- and experience of discrimination and harassment, we have also had reports of hateful speech and hateful acts which we have reported promptly to toronto police service. After hearing these complaints of our community and after recognizing how long the use of this space has been denied to other members of our community, we felt now is the time to act.

>>> My apologies, that's merrick gertner, not garden temple in he said the offer presented to the student is conditional on them clearing the encampment, not setting it up anywhere else on campus and letting convocation ceremonies proceed uninterrupted. That first convocation ceremony set to be held on june 3rd, right over there. And the president saying those ceremonies will go ahead regardless of whether the students accept this offer. >> That is meagan fitzpatrick on campus at u of t this morning. >> There is breaking news just now from canadian border and customs officers, that they could go on strike as early as next month. In a release just out this morning, their union says workers with cbsa, canada border service agency have voted the 6% in favour of job action. Now, there's no strike date yet, but their union expects to be in an illegal strike position in early june. 90% of border officers are considered essential can't can't walk off the job but it could cause delays for travellers at border crossing as and at airports of course right at the time of the busy holiday season. Now this. >> Hey, this is andrew McCARTHY calling you. >> Hey ally. >> Hey, molly. >> Let's call rob. >> Hello. >> Judge? >> Andrew McCARTHY tracking down the gang for a new documentary about the brat pack.

Also ordering israel to keep the rafah border crossing open for basic supplies for humanitarian aid, to allow investigators access to the territory in gaza to investigate what is at the basis of the south african allegation of genocide, and report back on all measures israel has taken in a month. Those are the four key points from the decision you saw live on cbc morning live, this is all in request for south africa's request for a cease-fire. The ruling is legally binding, the icj cannot enforce it. Israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. Now, we're looking here at live pictures outside the building known as the peace palace, this is the icj, the international court of justice, and we do expect to see as we've seen in past moments on this case lawyers from both sides on the steps of the courthouse responding to the icj decision. We will have that for you live just as soon as we see. As far as reaction, we are just

hearing through reuters from, palestinian authority, here is the statement from the palestinian authority, welcoming the icj decision and saying it represents, quote, an international consensus to end israel's war on gaza. That again from the palestinian presidency, a spokesperson to the reuters news agency. And we will continue to bring you reaction, there is just some reaction and now again to reuters from israel's finance minister, saying that after this ruling, those who demand that israel stop the war are demanding that it should decide to cease to exist, israel will not agree to that. That gives you a sense of the kind of reaction we will see from both sides to come. So we will watch that story very closely through the day here on cbc news network, and just before we go, let's touch base one more time with chris murphy and our forecast heading into the weekend, race weekend in ottawa, all sorts of activities outdoors, all across the country, chris, have a good one. >> Thank you, you too, heather, yeah, big travel weekend in the states, memorial day weekend and again from the upper midwest right down to the southern plains, severe weather there. We've got rain on the north side of our low pressure system. This is the biggest weather maker for today, certainly, in southern manitoba, where we could be looking at more than 50 millimeters worth of rain by the time it ends tomorrow. This is a slow-moving system and locally heavy bands of rain and it's a cold rain, 4° in brandon, 10 in winnipeg, and you will be lucky if you see 10 and we could be getting into wet snow towards riding and turtle and duck mountain, those kind of parts, a little higher elevation. Over towards southern alberta and southern british columbia, another day where we can get some more showers and thunderstorms. Medicine hat has had 110 millimeters of rain so far in may. That is more than double what you would normally get. We could get more thunderstorms there. So there's your heavy rain and wet snow lifting northward, so by tomorrow afternoon, that rain is winding down in the south. More scattered showers and likely thunderstorms into the bc interior and for the south coast, you've got some scattered showers, for the next few days and below seasonal values as well. So the west is getting some beneficial rain, although when you start talking about 50-plus millimeters, we're talking tractors getting stuck in the field. So that's not necessarily good news. But overall, this moisture pattern in the west has been what we needed. Just wish we could get a little bit further north, scattered thunderstorms as mentioned possible, 5 to 15 millimeters of rain for the west coast and this again, portions today, tomorrow, and then there will be more additional rain sunday with those cooler temperatures. Beautiful day in much of the lower great lakes, st. Lawrence river, very warm in the maritimes. Now, keep an eye on your northwest sky because we've got the cold front coming in, so scattered thunderstorms along were it, northwestern new brunswick mid afternoon spreads its way southeastwards through the late afternoon and evening hours, not everybody's going to get a storm, but at this point, we think below severe warning criteria, and there's going to be a chance overnight tonight that southwestern ontario could get a couple of nocturnal storms. That will spread their way eastwards tomorrow, but it's not an all day event saturday. >> The weather update is brought to you by the ""off! Cast"" mosquito forecast.

We begin with breaking news on the israel-hamas war and a ruling just out from the international court of justice in the hague. The judges at the icj had reaffirmed earlier orders in a case brought by south africa, and today they have ordered israel to halt its offensive in rafah. Israel has been ordered to reopen the rafah border crossing to give investigators access and to allow for the flow of aid and humanitarian investors. >> Israel must halt its military actions and any other actions which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza or conditions of life that could bring about the significant destruction. >> A reporter is just outside the court in the hague where that ruling came down. Alex, what can you tell us about the ruling and the potential impact? >> Certainly this ruling we expect would send a clear message and it has done that. The court ordering israel to cease all military operations in rafah. And explaining some of the logic behind that decision. They say the humanitarian situation in rafah can be seen as disastrous, and they are not convinced that israel has put enough in place to cater to that humanitarian support, or to allow for the safe evacuation of civilians. Two fold measures, one, the stopping of all military operations in rafah, and to allow for the axis of the united nations fact-finding mission in rafah as well. Clearly a message from the world court that israel has to do more, must do more, and that things have not approved -- improved since they last ordered israel to do so. Now the bigger question is a bit more complicated. Although these are legally binding orders they are not legally enforceable. The international court of justice says that palestine does not have a police force to enforce these orders. What they can do, or what the un can do is have the security council pass resolutions to sanction israel, force embargoes on israel and have enforcement actions on these orders, but those can be vetoed by the united states. So crucially the relationship between israel and washington dc is not crucial going forward. >> Reporter: as you are speaking, alex -- alex, allegedly hamas has issued a statement, saying that they are urging the security council to implement the icj ruling. Let us move away from the icj for a moment and turn to the icc, where the lead prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant for the israeli prime minister and other top israeli officials, as other -- as well as other members of hamas leadership. Let us talk about the increasing international pressure, presumably, where you are as well, we can hear that screaming, and all the pressure on israel? >> Certainly diplomatic pressure, we have heard spain, ireland and norway saying in a matter of days they will recognize palestinian states. Slovenia and belgium and others should follow suit. But crucially germany and france say the conditions have not been met to recognize palestine as a state, and that remains a big issue. The international criminal court requestinghose arrest warrants , and that decision will be made in a couple of months. That would mean that prime minister netanyahu, defence minister gallant, would not be able to travel to 124 countries around the world, including canada and most of the european union states as well for fear of being arrested. Now also the leadership of hamas , the leaders of hamas who organized the atrocities of october seventh are as well subject to those arrest warrants. But you are right to say that there is a building diplomatic pressure. Perhaps one difference is the new dutch government that will be formed in the next few days, and they seem to be more supportive of israel than the previous one. Globally speaking, more pressure on israel to do more, but there are se excepti >> Natasha: alex caddy eight, at the hague. Thank you. Let us get closer to the actual war. Let us go to gaza, where the israeli army says they have retrieved the bodies of three more hostages killed during the october 7th attack by hamas militants. The military says the recovery was part of a special operation in northern gaza which had seen erce fighting in recent days. Irris makler joins us now from jerusalem. She is tracking not part of the story. What do we know at this stage?

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Well, if you're a bull market, you want to, expect returns that would be normal to a bull market. And they are, they average over 20%, almost anywhere in the developed typically low 20's. So if you think about a last year, i-20 the 20's. That would be normal market. And so we're a bull market now and we're actually do the year and we're average numbers and we still a ways to run because it's a bull market. Yeah, I think that's the kind of so what of, of crunching these numbers is, don't get spooked by the numbers. >> You've seen so far this year because there can be a lot more there. And then it goes to what is underpinning that view that the bull market can continue. Is it that? >> Growth remains generally robust. And even though rates are elevated, seems like a lot of these companies can make a good go of it. >> So it just got back from. We go back to look at the 2022 bomber. Central banks had got near to finish raising rates. 10. Depending on where you are in the world. Markets at a bottom between september between july and september. When you think about october, when you think about that. So banks said euro bank almost every where they're still hiking rates at a pretty good clip. The fed was still doing. 75 beats a clip and the markets going up anyway. Fact of the matter is where moose, the market is current expectations for future reality. And the reality has been that the economy normal growth economy a little on the low side, yes, connelly implosion, the lockdowns in bounces back in a way above average rate of 6% average annual pass almost everywhere. Percent america and then it starts slowly descending back to normal. And we've had pretty much normal gdp growth rates in the developed world, a little below that still feels abnormal. Everything's that post covid fields have a normal and makes people more negative incentive. That is the jon templeton famously said bull markets are born on pessimism. Grow on skepticism, mature on optimism. And I I knew for ian were far so I'd like to ask you that in the context of ai you have seen and you think so deeply about the markets there certainly. >> Areas that can get ahead of themselves. What do you make of the frenzy for artificial intelligence, how much it makes up the broad market and whether it is creating a bit of a distortion. I think that's. >> Home perception. That's wrong. Let me help you with that. Look at all of the countries around the world hit new highs this year or 15 year highs this year. They little to no tech in the middle. Britain. Trump's germany. Denmark. Not a new all-time high, but a 15 year high in spain, you can go down the mountain of the netherlands. Also, it's got some tech but you can go to see that bull market is much broader than people think. But all the countries that don't have. Much any initative all-time highs in this cycle and this year and the last couple months. >> And then we can add to that list as driven by commodities. What do you make of the commodity rally? Does it make sense to you? I am not a good forecast. Commodity. >> They're inherently bowl, but of course, that's not good or bad. And the reality the features last few years also made them a little wacky. And I would hazard a forecast there. I do think and I have said and I wrote a column on this that energy is going to be strong as this year progresses started off. Well, and I think it will continue on the back half of the year because producers have the introduction of new supply coming on in overtime that haul prices sport fossil fuels. Back up to high end of

their last year's range. And then an environment where. Energy prices go up, but don't go through the roof. The big mega drillers do really that's a view on energy. I want to take you back. I asked ai and whacked asked directly broader tech sector just is, is that an area that you see can continue going higher. >> The answer is yes. And the reality is, we're in a very good environment for but let me just say every market, some parts speed and some parts ai and this time obviously leading big tech. Is the world doing well, smaller having more problems there growing, but not overly robust growth economy is perfect for companies that actually can grow in a fairly low growth environment is one of the reasons why growth stocks, including parts of growth that our tech are doing well going back yearly to ai. I want to make a point about macro sentiment tied to that. If you think about the jon templeton phrases, I said when you get into that euphoria it's not about singles of big companies that are strong in their category. It's about I banking world creating garbage to flow into the market, place the ipos and otherwise to take advantage of the euphoric money. And when you get euphoria, pick up in ipos in ipos of substantial quality can do get that, but that's okay. It's part of the world that we're creating some dream for those who are malicious euphoric and want have some hopes and dreams or something much more than a piece of paper garbage. And we haven't seen that. That's what we had some of which spots. >> You're absolutely right. So that's insight that maybe we're not quite at that euphoria you picked up on something you said about these growth stocks. And I think those that are more value oriented. If you look at it, you know, plain vanilla s&p value index for says that growth index, it has been underperforming. You know, when when did the valley investors get a break? >> Put that into perspective for you this way. Because earlier just a few moments ago, he talked about how the dow done so well relative to let's the s&p 500 nasdaq, which you know that in the s&p 500 at all, intraday all-time high yesterday and nasdaq's doing better still why and when. Best time for the value side is when growth picks up. Central banks cut short relative to long rates little down the road from here. Why is it true? Was always the most important questions or you're fundamentally correct in the y on the rate cutting part is because that impacts banks propensity to went win short rates fall long-term rates. Banks were in the core business of taking huge return to positive basin, making long-term loans get more eager to land and the easiest to win or the value companies. They weren't lending too much before or otherwise. Substantive companies as lending comes true real in the world, the value companies become more growth like and actually in really well in the market, the time to see that is with a lag 2. Central banks cutting rates. Well, it sure goes a long rich richard free market senate and it has the global economy continues to improve. >> Now I know you said, you know, like to forecast commodities, I know you don't like to hang your hat too much on interest rates and speculate on when they're going to cut. Are they going >> So you know, I outside portland, oregon for a long and it's like in america to centre of illegal drugs being legal.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment.

Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli Niinistö and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.
