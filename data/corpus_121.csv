The levy was introduced in the autumn of 2022 and reimburses the company Trading Hub Europe, which is responsible for organizing the German gas market, for costs incurred to ensure the security of the energy supply.

Getting rid of the levy would significantly reduce the costs of gas transit through Germany and support joint efforts by Germany's neighbours to move away from imported Russian gas, according to Sven Giegold, the top deputy to Economy Minister Robert Habeck.

""We will be supporting greater integration of the energy markets in Europe,"" Giegold said.

The levy not only affects companies and consumers in Germany, but also importers in neighbouring countries that purchase gas via German pipelines.

Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic planned to raise their continued objections to the levy at the EU energy minister meeting.

Giegold said he assumes the levy will continue to be charged inside Germany to cover the costs of securing energy supplies.

The levy was last extended until April 2027. Beginning in July, it is set to rise from the current €1.86 ($2.01) to €2.50 per megawatt hour.

According to calculations by the consumer comparison website Verivox, the gas storage levy will account for around 2% of a typical German household's gas bill after the levy increases in July.

Giegold said Germany's government has agreed on repealing the levy. Because it would require a change to German law and could go into effect no earlier than the beginning of 2025.

He said that it was never the German government's intention to hinder the integration of gas markets in Europe.

""It's quite the opposite. This levy was used to finance the filling of gas storage facilities, which has helped us to maintain a more independent and stable market in Europe,"" he said.

Central and Eastern European countries have criticized the increased transit costs caused by the levy, which makes importing gas from Western Europe more difficult.

EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson has also criticized the levy and its impact on European energy markets. Simson said she sent multiple letters to Berlin over the policy.

Giegold's comments provoked some criticism from within Germany's governing coalition. Michael Kruse, a politician with the free-market liberal Free Democrats (FDP), called the remarks premature and expressed concern about the impact on German consumers.

""It must be ensured that users of German gas storage facilities from abroad receive an appropriate share of the storage levy. These costs must not be passed on to German gas customers,"" Kruse told dpa.

Trading Hub Europe, however, said that the impact on German gas consumers would likely be minimal, since calculations so far have assumed very low quantities of cross-border gas shipments moving through Germany.

Austrian Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler called Giegold's remarks ""good news."" She said that cross-border shipments of gas from Germany to Austria had fallen drastically after Germany imposed the levy, making it harder for the country to shift away from buying Russian gas.

""I am pleased that the many talks and also the pressure from neighbouring countries have helped and that the German government is now tackling this,"" she said.",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!

The charge is levied on all gas exiting the German grid, to consumers and at cross-border interconnection points.

THE introduced the levy to recoup the cost of purchasing 50TWh of gas in summer 2022 on the spot market, without hedging it forward. It bought this gas at an average price of around €175/MWh.

The levy is ""significantly influenced"" by completed and forecast sales of that stored gas, THE said. Prices fell more sharply than expected last winter and weighed on expected revenues, leading to the increase in the charge. THE also attributed the increase to consumption and transit volumes having each declined during the previous levy period.

THE said today that it has now sold all the volumes it originally purchased. It sold around 37.5TWh in December 2023-April 2024 at an average price of roughly €48.50/MWh, generating revenues of €1.42bn. The market area manager in winter 2022-23 sold 12.5TWh at an average price of €77.50/MWh. THE generated revenues of €996mn from sales in July 2022-April 2023, the firm's accounts show.

Now that THE has sold all the gas that it bought in summer 2022, it must recoup its remaining losses fully through the levy.

The firm's gas storage levy neutrality account showed a deficit of €6.69bn still to be recouped as of the end of last month. That said, the firm's accounts do not yet show revenues generated by the levy in March or April.

The levy is scheduled to remain in place until the end of March 2027, previously extended from the same date in 2025. THE reassesses the levy for each six-month period.",argusmedia.com,news,Argus Media,,0.06666666666666665,454166132,1,,eng-9588552

In the summer of 2022, when Russia stopped supplying gas to Germany, the government authorised large-scale purchases to ensure storage facilities were well-filled before winter. When gas prices dropped, market operator Trading Hub Europe (THE) levied a surcharge on gas flows to recoup the cost.

As of July, the charge will be increased by another 34% to €2.50 per MWh, THE announced on Tuesday. The announcement comes amid a prolonged three-way stand-off between Vienna, Berlin and Brussels.

Austria, supported by countries like Poland, Hungary and Czechia, says the surcharge obstructs their move away from Russian gas as non-Russian gas imported through Western European LNG terminals becomes more costly due to the added German transit fee.

Vienna says the fee violates the EU's free movement of goods rule. Asked by an EU lawmaker, the Commission said it is ""carefully monitoring the situation in the EU and is in contact with German authorities regarding the legality of the gas storage fee"".

The German government has insisted in the past that the storage fee is in line with EU rules and contributes to the stability of the European gas market - by financing annual storage obligations.

""We are continuing to hold intensive talks with the Commission and the member states on this issue,"" a spokesperson for the German Ministry of Economy and Climate Action told Euractiv.

Trading Hub Europe, which runs the German market and is tasked with levying the charge and keeping gas storages full, explained the surge in the context of a rapid drop in gas prices.

""In 2022, THE purchased some 50 TWh of gas at an average price of approx. 175 EUR/MWh for injection into storage,"" THE recounted, adding that while they managed to sell a quarter of the gas at 50% of the purchase price, the remaining volume had to be sold at less than a third of the purchasing price.

Among experts and industry associations, the charge is rather unpopular.

""The European Commission should now get into gear and put its foot down,"" said Christoph Dolna-Gruber, an expert from Austria, adding that the charge had triggered a downward spiral: Less gas flows through Germany in response to the charge, resulting in higher charges to recoup the massive gas trading losses.

Power industry association Eurelectric, for its part, said the charge violates the EU'S free trade principles.",euractiv.com,news,EurActiv.com,,0.07450980392156858,454005431,51,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/10848759-800x450.jpg,eng-9585860

RWE and Equinor have signed a new supply contract for between 10 and 15 terrawatt hours (equivalent to ca. 1 - 1.5 billion cubic metrers - bcm) of natural gas per year from now until 2028.

This new bilateral agreement builds upon the long-standing relationship between RWE and Equinor. The contract is priced at market terms and the gas will be delivered at Germany's virtual trading hub THE (Trading Hub Europe).

""Germany and Norway have been energy partners ever since Norwegian gas exports first started more than 45 years ago. I am very pleased that we continue to develop this partnership and that we can announce another bilateral agreement between Equinor and RWE, which is one of many companies that see Norwegian gas as an enabler for energy security as well as of the energy transition,"" says Helge Haugane, Equinor's senior vice president Gas & Power.

Andree Stracke, CEO of RWE Supply & Trading:

""We are delighted to have signed a long-term gas supply agreement with our partner Equinor. For us as a global energy trader gas plays an important role in the energy transition. The newly concluded gas supply agreement adds a further important building block to our Pan-European natural gas portfolio contributing to security of supply.""

Earlier this year RWE and Equinor announced their plan to develop large-scale value chains to ensure security of supply and reduce emissions in response to the German-Norwegian Partnership on Climate, Renewable Energy and Green Industry.

The first step is to invest in and develop gas fired power plants in Germany that are ready to use hydrogen as feedstock as soon as it becomes available on an industrial scale in the country. These plants are also subject to the power plant strategy announced by the German government, which aims to create a suitable regulatory framework for new gas-fired power plants.

Key elements in the value chain will be exports of low carbon hydrogen from Norway to Germany which could help speed up the development of a hydrogen economy. Gradually, green hydrogen will also be produced using power from wind farms along the pipeline route.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.3647058823529412,453446072,1,,eng-9563546
