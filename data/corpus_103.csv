NATO has inaugurated a specialised centre focused on the security of extensive undersea energy pipelines and cables, which are crucial for global communications, energy supply, and economic stability yet remain vulnerable to attacks.

The newly established NATO Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure (CUI) is based at NATO Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM) in Northwood, UK. The centre, which recently achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC), serves as a networking and knowledge hub that supports Commander MARCOM in decision-making, force deployment, and action coordination.

Royal Navy Vice Admiral Mike Utley, Commander MARCOM, said: ""Securing CUI goes beyond posturing to deter future aggression; it includes robust coordination, to actively monitor and counter malign or hybrid threats, denying any aggressor the cover of 'plausible deniability'.

""Through the wide networks we are establishing in the new centre, that job will become much easier to achieve. And if, in the future, nations seek NATO assistance, we will be ready to help them using our networks and data.""

The centre functions as the operational hub at MARCOM, whilst a strategic hub is located at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. This dual-hub structure aims to enhance cooperation between NATO allies, partners, and the private sector. The importance of civilian stakeholder engagement was highlighted by the Norwegian Oil Industry, which expressed its support in a joint statement along with Offshore Norge, gas transport operator Gassco AS, and energy company Equinor ASA.

""It's been a year of strong teamwork defining and establishing the centre here at MARCOM, and we are now seeing the results as we reach this important milestone,"" said Danish Navy Captain Niels Markussen, Director of the NATO Shipping Centre.

""We've overcome many challenges to get here. Strong cooperation from cross-functional areas across MARCOM have been key to success, including operations, intelligence, IT, and Civil Military Cooperation (CIMIC). We've also worked tirelessly with other NATO entities including NATO HQ, SHAPE, SACT, and CMRE, as well as many civilian organisations.""

The formal launch comes after NATO HQ hosted the inaugural meeting of NATO's Critical Undersea Infrastructure Network last week, where senior experts exchanged information and shared expertise against the backdrop of evolving threats to CUI.

Professor James Bergeron, MARCOM's Political Advisor, drew attention to the centre's role in surveillance and accountability.

""Protecting every inch of CUI is hard,"" Bergeron admitted. ""But what we can do, and it's a phrase we've used a lot lately, is try to deny deniability. If a malefactor is going to try to harass, undermine or clandestinely attack offshore infrastructure, undersea infrastructure, the main thing we seek to achieve is that they cannot get away with it.

""Instead, they will be spotted, the cameras will be snapping, the underwater sensors will be monitoring, and there will be a signals trail of liability, so that they're not going to be able to deny their actions and will ultimately be held liable.""

Allies first agreed to establish the Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure at MARCOM during the Vilnius Summit last year -- a decision reaffirmed by Defence Ministers in February. Contributing nations now include Denmark, Germany, Norway, Poland, Türkiye, the UK, and the USA, with Greece, Portugal, and Sweden soon to join.

The establishment of the centre represents a significant part of NATO's ongoing efforts to safeguard critical undersea infrastructure. By bolstering coordination and employing advanced monitoring technologies, the alliance aims to protect these vital assets from malign activities and assure accountability for any actions that might threaten them.

This investment will boost reservoir production, thereby sustaining the high gas export levels from the Troll and Kollsnes value chain up to 2030.

Stage 2 of the Troll Phase 3 project entails drilling eight new wells from two new templates with subsea controls extended from existing ones. Additionally, a new gas flowline will be laid to connect with the Troll A platform, accompanied by modification work on Troll A. The first wells are expected to begin production by the end of 2026.

""This project is exceptionally profitable and will ensure sustained high gas production from the Troll field. The partnership's decision is crucial for maximizing the capacity of our existing infrastructure. We have opted to collaborate with reliable and familiar suppliers, most of whom already have framework agreements with us,"" says Geir Tungesvik, Equinor's executive vice president of Projects, Drilling & Procurement.

""It's a significant advantage that several of them have prior experience from the earlier stage of the Troll Phase 3 development. We will leverage this experience to ensure safe and efficient project delivery and implementation,"" says Tungesvik.

The new infrastructure will boost reservoir production by approximately 55 billion standard cubic meters of gas. At its peak, this development will contribute around 7 billion standard cubic meters of gas annually.

"" Since 2022, we've been collaborating with our partners, Gassco, and the Norwegian authorities to optimize energy deliveries from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). This initiative aims to enable Troll and Kollsnes to sustain their significant contributions to the NCS's role in ensuring European energy security during demanding periods. According to Kjetil Hove, Executive Vice President for Exploration and Production Norway, the gas from Troll alone meets approximately 10% of Europe's demands.

The initial phase of gas extraction from the Troll West gas field commenced in 2021, incorporating eight wells along with a freshly constructed pipeline leading to the Troll A platform, alongside a new inlet module. This segment of the endeavor contributed to prolonging plateau production by 5-7 years. The upcoming Stage 2 is poised to expand plateau production by approximately four years, thereby mitigating production decline over the subsequent 10-12 years.

The enhancements made at the Kollsnes processing facility have led to a rise in the plateau production of Troll gas. Previously capped at 121 million standard cubic meters of gas per day, the maximum output has now been elevated to 129 million. With the introduction of new Troll wells, an additional 20 million standard cubic meters of gas per day will be added to the production tally.",chemanalyst.com,news,chemanalyst.com,,0.3568627450980393,454576933,1,,

This ambitious project aims to reinforce Europe's energy security by ensuring high levels of gas export.

Expanding the Troll Field Infrastructure

The Troll field, a foundation of Norway's energy production, has been developed in multiple phases. Phase 1 focused on the Troll East gas resources, leading to the establishment of the Troll A platform and the Kollsnes gas plant, with gas exported to Europe via the Zeepipe pipelines. Phase 2 targeted the Troll West oil resources, resulting in the Troll B and C platforms and their associated infrastructure. The first part of Phase 3 began producing gas from the gas cap overlying the oil column in Troll West.

New Investments and Developments

Equinor, in partnership with Gassco and Norwegian authorities, plans to invest more than NOK 12 billion (approximately $1.13 billion) to further develop the Troll West gas area. This investment is expected to support eight new wells from two new templates, subsea control extensions from existing templates, and a new gas flowline to the Troll A platform. The project, known as Troll Phase 3 (TP3 II), aims to accelerate reservoir production and maintain high gas export levels through 2030.

Kjetil Hove, Equinor's executive vice president for Exploration and Production Norway, highlighted the importance of the project. He noted that it will help enable Troll and Kollsnes to maintain their crucial role in ensuring the Norwegian Continental Shelf's support for European energy security, especially in difficult times. He also mentioned that the gas from Troll alone supplies approximately 10% of Europe's demand.

Enhancing Production and Infrastructure

The new development is expected to produce around 55 billion standard cubic meters of gas, with an annual peak contribution of approximately 7 billion standard cubic meters. Recent upgrades at the Kollsnes processing plant have increased the maximum production capacity from Troll to 129 million standard cubic meters of gas per day. The new infrastructure should further boost this output by an additional 20 million standard cubic meters of gas per day.

The first stage of gas production from the Troll West gas asset, initiated in 2021, extended plateau production by five to seven years. The second stage aims to extend it further by around four years and mitigate production decline over the next decade.

Contracts and Partnerships

Several contracts have been awarded for the TP3 II project. OneSubsea secured the front-end engineering and design contract, with an option for detailed engineering, procurement and construction of subsea production systems, including umbilicals.

The pipelaying contract for the 36-inch gas pipeline was awarded to Allseas, while Odfjell Drilling's Deepsea Aberdeen rig will drill eight production wells on the Troll field. These drilling activities are scheduled to commence in late 2025 or early 2026, with an estimated cost of NOK 1.3 billion ($122.9 million).

Sustaining Europe's Energy Supply

The Troll field partners -- Equinor Energy (30.58%, operator), Petoro (56%), Norske Shell (8.10%), TotalEnergies EP Norge (3.69%), and ConocoPhillips Skandinavia (1.62%) -- continue to emphasize the field's vital role in Europe's energy landscape. With substantial reserves still untapped, Troll is Norway's largest gas producer, with an annual export volume that's equal to around 10% of gas consumption in Europe.

Equinor's continued investment in the Troll field highlights its commitment to bolstering Europe's energy security and sustaining long-term gas production.

Looking at the latest Intercontinental Exchange Index data, the number of positions for the Dutch TTF natural gas futures for the week ending May 17, 2024, totaled 2.88 billion lots for both long and short positions.

Of this total, the majority was contributed by commercial undertakings at 64.25%, which includes unregulated traders, commercial enterprises, family office and university endowment funds, according to the ICE index data.

After this, the largest proportion was contributed by investment funds at 24.05%, which comprises investment funds, unit trusts ETFs and hedge funds.

In third place was investment firms or credit institutions at around 11.68%, which account for brokers, and proprietary traders in commodity derivates.

The rest of the positions were accounted for by other financial institutions and operators with obligations under directive 2003/87/EC.

While physical players in the market hold the largest proportion of positions, traders have pointed to investment funds playing an increasing role in the last few years.

""You saw it a lot last year, where US hedge funds would look more at that [news, geopolitical, global risks] rather than supply-demand fundamentals,"" an LNG trader said, adding that some intraday volatility was more sentiment driven by US players rather than fundamentals.

Intraday dynamics

For most of the winter 2023-24 heating season, European gas and LNG markets remain structurally bearish, with EU gas inventories this year starting the injection season at record highs, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) data.

However, during intraday trading sessions, European gas markets saw downwards pressure in the early morning sessions before spiking in the afternoon.

Activity has picked up this week due to growing bullish signals, however, similar intraday trends have been seen recently.

""The latest positioning data shows that investment funds reduced their net long in TTF by 11.66 million contracts over the last week to 91.55 million contracts as of 17 May, the first decline since early April,"" Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy, and Ewa Manthey, commodities strategist, at ING said in a May 23 note.

Algorithm-based trading

Another LNG trader attested to period of weakness during morning sessions, noting the emergence of price spikes in the afternoon, suggesting hedge funds do not necessarily react to market fundamentals but focus more on geopolitical risks and have focus on ""algorithm-based trading.""

""It used to be Dated Brent that just reacted to the geopolitical risks now it's more gas [and LNG],"" the second LNG trader said, adding that you now see gas, LNG markets reacting to oil-related news despite the current bearish market fundamentals.

""They do not care about fundamentals,"" a UK-based gas trader said, pointing to the substantial impact of institutional derivatives players.

Further to this, the source stated such players could ""easily move the market"" if the level of certain positions were triggered.

Likewise, a Germany-based trader observed that US-based institutional players tend to trade on news rather than European gas market fundamentals, highlighting outages at the Norwegian Continental Shelf as an example.

""I know there was excessive maintenance on Gassco side and possibility to extend and market [price] overreaction,"" a gas trader said. ""And today it seems to back, but price reached the April 16 level, I don't think it will continue, hedge funds have already started to decrease their long positions on TTF.""

Facts about Troll Partnership: Equinor Energy AS 30.58% (operator), Petoro AS 56%, AS Norske Shell 8.10%, TotalEnergies EP Norge AS 3.69%, ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS 1.62%.

Troll is Norway's largest gas producer, with substantial reserves still underground.

The annual export volume from Troll corresponds to an estimated 10% of Europe's gas consumption.

Annual energy production from the Troll field corresponds to approx. 3 times the annual Norwegian hydropower production.

The vast resource base has made it necessary to plan the development and production in three phases:

Phase 1 is the gas in Troll East, which resulted in Troll A, the Kollsnes gas plant and associated infrastructure. The gas is exported to Europe via the Zeepipe pipelines; Phase 2 is the oil in Troll West, which resulted in the Troll B and C platforms and associated infrastructure. The oil is sent to the oil terminal at Mongstad; Phase 3 involves producing the gas cap overlying the oil column in Troll West, while also continuing the production of oil. The produced gas goes to Troll A and onward in existing infrastructure. Phase 3 stage 2 will accelerate gas volumes from Troll West. Eight wells will be drilled from two subsea templates.

Equinor and the Troll partners have decided to invest just over $1.13 billion (NOK 12 billion) to further develop the gas infrastructure in the Troll West gas province, offshore Norway.

Equinor said the investment would accelerate production from the reservoir and thus maintain the current high gas export levels from the Troll and Kollsnes value chain leading up to 2030.

Stage 2 of the Troll Phase 3 project includes eight new wells from two new templates with subsea controls extended from existing templates.

A new gas flowline will be laid as a tie-back to the Troll A platform, and the project will also perform modification work on Troll A. The first wells are scheduled to come on stream at the end of 2026.

""This is a highly profitable project that will secure high gas production from the Troll field. The partnership's decision is important in order for us to fully utilize the capacity of existing infrastructure. We've chosen to use solid, familiar suppliers, most of which already have framework agreements with us,"" said Geir Tungesvik, Equinor's executive vice president, Projects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP).

The new infrastructure will accelerate production from the reservoir equivalent to about 55 billion standard cubic metres of gas. At its peak, the annual contribution from the new development will amount to around 7 billion standard cubic metres of gas.

""We have been working alongside our partners, Gassco and the Norwegian authorities to maximize energy deliveries from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) since 2022. This project will allow Troll and Kollsnes to continue their substantial contributions to the role of the NCS in guaranteeing European energy security in challenging times. The gas from Trollalone meets around 10 % of Europe's demands,"" said Kjetil Hove, executive vice president for Exploration and Production Norway.

The first stage of gas production from the Troll West gas province started in 2021 and included eight wells and a new pipeline to the Troll A platform, as well as a new inlet module. This part of the project helped extend plateau production by 5-7 years. Stage 2 will further extend plateau production by around four years and reduce the production decline over the next 10-12 years.

Plateau production of Troll gas has increased as a result of recent upgrades at the Kollsnes processing plant. Maximum production from Troll used to be 121 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. This has now been increased to 129 million. Production from the new Troll wells will amount to about 20 million standard cubic metres of gas per day.

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the DES Northwest Europe and Mediterranean markers for July at $10.445/MMBtu May 21, up 33.4 cents/MMBtu on the day, and at the highest levels seen since Dec. 27, when it was at $10.756/MMBtu.

At the same time, Platts assessed the East Med marker at $10.645/MMBtu, also the highest seen since Dec. 27.

LNG prices across Europe are under pressure, with market participants looking to compete for cargoes against Asia. Heat waves in Asia have sparked stronger seasonal demand, creating sturdy competition between the European and Asian LNG supply.

In comparison, JKM also recently reached a price high of $11.498/MMBtu on May 20 -- the highest since Dec. 18 -- before falling slightly to $11.485/MMBtu May 21, Commodity Insights data showed.

Although Europe is comfortable with high gas inventories, European LNG supply has constricted week on week. In both the NWE and Mediterranean, LNG traders saw sellers with the flexibility in taking cargoes toward Asia over Northwest Europe and suggested that prices in Europe need to increase further to attract selling interest.

""No expectation [for demand] to pick up, people cannot pay, [Europe is] completely out of price,"" an LNG trader said.

While natural gas prices have strengthened recently amid continued geopolitical uncertainty and a tightening supply environment for both pipeline flows and LNG imports into the continent, European natural gas prices have yet to reach highs touched in mid-April.

Despite an uptick in planned maintenance on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, which analysts at Commodity Insights expect will reduce flows from these assets by 11% month on month, Norwegian gas nominations have remained relatively strong averaging 300.5 million cu m/d in May so far basis data from offshore pipeline Gassco.

Although most of the ongoing maintenances on the Atlantic side are planned, the market is still wary of any potential extensions which could put pressure on the market going into the third quarter, where injections are expected to be stronger.

""There is a lot of maintenance in the North Sea...Just because [the maintenances] are planned doesn't reduce the potential impact if things go wrong,"" an Atlantic-based trader said. ""With a relatively tight LNG market, this skews risk to the upside.""

Historically as TTF prices increase, LNG-TTF spreads would widen. However, LNG-TTF spreads have remained persistently narrow due to increased global competition for LNG, sources said. Traders pointed to a ""new normal"" with expectations that the spreads will stay narrow as European bids remain relatively strong to attract cargoes.

""I am bullish on LNG-TTF spreads, TTF seems to be lagging behind the [geopolitical] news,"" a second LNG trader said, adding that European prices were still falling behind those seen in Asia.

Platts assessed NWE LNG prices at a 17.5 cents/MMBtu discount to the TTF Dutch gas hub price. The discount has averaged around 41 cents/MMBtu this year so far, compared with the 2023 average of $1.70/MMBtu.

Similarly, East and West Med prices have been strong compared with TTF which has made it uneconomical to import LNG, pushing European and Med market participants to replenish supply on inland pipeline volumes.

""PVB [the Spanish gas hub price] has been strengthening the past few days which is indicating a tightening [LNG] market and that is the same in the East Med too,"" the second LNG trader said.

A Med-based trader said: ""[The] market seems tight, and any news can push prices to spike.""

""Pipegas has great activity, we have this LNG freeze, but pipeline gas is a more hot environment, especially with the narrow LNG-TTF spreads it makes more sense to buy on gas,"" another Med-based trader said.

However, the tight spreads were disincentivizing LNG flows into the continent as the prices, albeit high for European buyers, were unable to compete with the cargoes heading to Asia.

""The only ones that are buying is because they have a firm commitment or they really need it,"" another trader said. ""Everyone is cancelling.""

Sendout levels from EU LNG hubs stood at 2,789 GWh/d May 18 and 2,797 GWh/d May 19, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe data -- the lowest the bloc has seen since Oct. 8's 2,710 GWh/d.

Sendout was also down sharply on the year, averaging at 3,092 GWh/d for the first 19 days of May, 24% lower than 4,048 GWh/d during the same period last year.

The low sendout levels are a sign of weak LNG demand in the region as current price levels and competition from the East is prompting market players to rely more heavily on gas.

""I think it's just a reflection of weak LNG demand,"" David Lewis, LNG Analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights, said. ""Norwegian flows have remained robust and demand has been tempered by mild weather and strong renewables generation.""

Indeed, Europe has imported a total of 5.5 million mt of LNG in May so far this year, according to Commodity Insights data May 21. These are the lowest levels seen since September, when imports totaled 5.4 million mt between Sept. 1-21. The imports are also down 32% from same time last year.

On the gas side, total exit nominations from the Norwegian Continental Shelf reached just under 9.61 Bcm over April for an average daily sendout of 320 million cu m, according to data from offshore pipeline operator Gassco.

Despite a recent uptick in maintenance that analysts at S&P Global expect to reduce NCS production by 11% month on month over May, average daily sendout from Norway has so far remained relatively robust at around 304 million cu m/d according to further Gassco data.

The European market is still awaiting higher summer temperatures, which could provide an impetus to LNG imports in certain European regions, although until then healthy gas inventory levels are dampening any urgency to import LNG for injections.

Gas inventory levels in the EU were 67.2% full as of May 19, according to GIE data, up from 65.2% at the same time last year.

""It's an indication that the market is softening as the inventory is full,"" said an Atlantic-based LNG trading analyst.

The tight spreads between LNG and gas, despite low demand, are also disincentivizing LNG trade in the region, with gas prices picking up in tandem with the JKM -- the benchmark price for delivering cargoes into North Asia. Europe is going strong on bids, but the prices are still in favor of Asia.

The JKM for July delivery was last assessed by Platts, part of Commodity Insights, at $11.498/MMBtu May 21, up 32.6 cents/MMBtu on the day, while the LNG DES Northwest Europe Marker for July was at $10.111/MMBtu May 20 -- a discount of 14 cents/MMBtu to the July TTF hub futures price.

There are a few ongoing maintenances in the region, which could have some effect on sendout levels for certain countries. However, this is usually counterbalanced by upticks seen in other regions.

""There are definitely quite a few regas maintenances out there,"" Lewis said. ""For instance, Germany only has two active FSRUs [floating storage and regasification units] at the moment due to maintenance at the Lubmin FSRU and the delays to other terminals. But what's interesting is that other NWE countries have not seen an uptick to compensate for the reduced regas capacity.""

Of all the European nations, only Poland has seen slight upticks in LNG imports year on year, and, Finland, Greece and Turkey have seen small increments month on month, while all the other countries have been bogged down by heavy declines.

Most of the regions in Europe, except for East Med and the Baltics, have been priced out, according to market participants. This is pivoting the region's reliance from LNG to the relatively cheaper pipeline gas.

The front-month values at the Dutch TTF -- Europe's bellwether natural gas hub -- have been largely stable at around Eur28-32/MWh since May began. Platts last assessed the TTF front-month contract at Eur31.925/MWh (equivalent to $10.172/MMBtu) on May 20.

In north-west Europe, falling wind speeds could lift demand for gas from power plants over the weekend.

""Technically, the TTF day-ahead hit a wall at the 30 euros/MWh 21-day moving average as a potential resistance threshold,"" said LSEG gas analyst Yuriy Onyshkiv.

The day-ahead price settled at 30 euros/MWh on Thursday and was yet to trade at the time of writing, according to LSEG data.

""If it breaks through it, the price may continue demonstrating further gains. However, the technical signals are mixed, while fundamentally our balance forecast is sideways. Meanwhile, the market is seeking further signals for direction,"" he added.

Norway now supplies 30% of the bloc's gas; Gazprom provided about 35% of all Europe's gas before the war.

And of the more than 109 Bcm of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year -- enough to power Germany until 2026 -- roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by Equinor.

So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.

Equinor's visibility ""dramatically changed with reduced flows from Russia,"" said Irene Rummelhoff, the company's head of midstream, marketing and processing. ""There was a point in time where [Europe] almost took us for granted. That is no longer the case.""

Part of the company's good fortune has to do with a broader shift in Europe's relationship to oil and gas, Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, chief analyst for sustainable finance at Nordea Bank Abp, said in an interview.

Five years ago, ""there was a lot of talk about the green transition and how we were starting to see the oil and gas industry sunset,"" she said. ""Then Covid happened, then the war in Ukraine, and now you simply don't see it anymore. The focus has turned to energy security.""

The notion that natural gas won't disappear anytime soon, a view strongly endorsed by the oil and gas gas industry, has thrust Norway to the center of the conversation around securing Europe's energy resources.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck -- who is also in charge of climate policy in the region's biggest economy -- made an official visit to Oslo in early January 2023. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled two months later to Norway's Troll natural gas field, which provides 10% of the continent's supplies.

EU energy czar Kadri Simson has also visited Norway twice in the past two years. Speaking at an event in the Norwegian capital in March, Simson told a hall filled with the country's oil and gas elite that ""the EU continues to count on Norway as a partner for conventional sources,"" and offered her appreciation for its help during the energy crisis.

The non-EU member has never been shy about the importance it places on natural gas -- Norway has long advocated that gas should place a central role in the bloc's green transition -- and now it is finding more willing counterparts.

In late April, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked Norway for enabling his country to become independent of Russian gas ""within just a few months,"" and praised it as ""the perfect partner"" for securing Germany and Europe's supply.

Norway's new role as a natural gas purveyor to Europe has been very profitable -- gas exports hit a record high of 1.4 trillion kroner ($130 billion) in 2022.

Equinor's growing relevance in Europe came into sharp focus last summer, when the company announced that maintenance at some of its biggest gas facilities was being extended. Within minutes, gas prices rose almost 20%.

The response was especially intense as traders had mostly been betting that prices would slump. Sluggish demand and the fact that the region's gas inventories would be full by the end of the summer had led them to think that Europe had finally gotten over the worst of the energy crisis. Unusually hot weather on the continent, which normally increases energy use, amplified concern.

The unplanned outages severely reduced Norway's exports for a few weeks and prompted trading desks across the continent to weigh the ""Equinor maintenance effect"" more heavily in their models.

As the price of gas became even more exposed to the company's status, traders started to pay closer attention to the daily messages sent out by another Norwegian company, Gassco AS, about changes to maintenance schedules across the country.

Within Equinor, there are ""information barriers and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations so that all market participants can access market sensitive information at the same time,"" a company spokesman said, adding that Gassco acts as a ""neutral and independent system operator.""

Traders were already on alert for surprise outages. Until the end of 2021, Gazprom had mostly been a reliable supplier -- a big reason why gas prices stayed stable over the last decade. When interruptions suddenly started to happen more frequently, prices spiked, triggering the energy crisis.

What nobody knew back then is that reducing gas flows was part of the run-up to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Around November, traders started to account for the loss of Russian supply in their pricing models.

Europe is on a far better footing than it was a year ago, but circumstances remain volatile. Any threat to fuel supply can roil markets, and that, in turn, can have downstream effects: persistent price swings in the natural gas market can encourage industrial companies to limit their fuel usage and push household bills higher.

""Norway is expected to meet more of Europe's gas needs this summer as its facilities bounce back from the extensive maintenance seen last year,"" BloombergNEF's Nnenna Amobi wrote in a note on May 1. ""But,"" she added, ""unplanned outages could yet curtail flows and send prices upward.""

At the same time, natural gas supplies from Norway may reach a new record this year. Equinor has been working to increase its capacity, and to reduce bottlenecks by streamlining maintenance work. The mantra within the country's government - often repeated by energy minister Terje Aasland - is that Norway will be a ""stable and long-term supplier of energy"" for decades to come.

It remains to be seen whether that will pan out. With a new wave of LNG from the US and Qatar coming online in the next few years, ""the importance of Equinor and Norway's gas to Europe is going to eventually decline,"" said Christopher Kuplent, Bank of America Corp.'s head of European energy research, noting that Norway will ""find it hard to organically grow its gas production and therefore export substantially more."" The new projects will, he added, ""make it, at least on paper, a little more comfortable for the European gas consumer to negotiate prices down.""

Moreover, said Equinor's Rummelhoff, a jump in the volumes of liquefied natural gas being imported to Europe recently has already helped ""normalize the market.""

For now, focus within Equinor is on keeping things running as smoothly as possible. ""Do we feel under pressure?

Norway's new role as gas purveyor to Europe has been very profitable -- gas exports hit a record high of 1.4 trillion kroner ($130 billion) in 2022 -- but it has also cast a question mark over Norway's green future. While the country has become a leader in initiatives like the transition to electric vehicles, the recent surge in demand for gas has had the effect of redirecting financial resources and talent back into the oil and gas sector. Organizations such as Greenpeace have expressed concern that Europe's embrace of Norwegian gas could come at the expense of the broader green transition.

And for traders, going all in on Equinor brings a different set of problems.

Equinor's growing relevance in Europe came into sharp focus last summer, when the company announced that maintenance at some of its biggest gas facilities was being extended. Within minutes, gas prices rose almost 20 percent.

The response was especially intense, as traders had mostly been betting that prices would slump. Sluggish demand and the fact that the region's gas inventories would be full by the end of the summer had led them to think that Europe had finally gotten over the worst of the energy crisis. Unusually hot weather on the continent, which normally increases energy use, amplified concern.

The unplanned outages severely reduced Norway's exports for a few weeks and prompted trading desks across the continent to weigh the ""Equinor maintenance effect"" more heavily in their models. As the price of gas became even more exposed to the company's status, traders started to pay closer attention to the daily messages sent out by another Norwegian company, Gassco AS, about changes to maintenance schedules across the country.

Within Equinor, there are ""information barriers and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations so that all market participants can access market sensitive information at the same time,"" a company spokesman said, adding that Gassco acts as a ""neutral and independent system operator.""

Traders were already on alert for surprise outages. Until the end of 2021, Gazprom had mostly been a reliable supplier -- a big reason why gas prices stayed stable over the last decade. When interruptions suddenly started to happen more frequently, prices spiked, triggering the energy crisis.

What nobody knew back then is that reducing gas flows was part of the run-up to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Around November, traders started to account for the loss of Russian supply in their pricing models.

Europe is on a far better footing than it was a year ago, but circumstances remain volatile. Any threat to fuel supply can roil markets, and that, in turn, can have downstream effects: persistent price swings in the natural gas market can encourage industrial companies to limit their fuel usage and push household bills higher. ""Norway is expected to meet more of Europe's gas needs this summer as its facilities bounce back from the extensive maintenance seen last year,"" BloombergNEF's Nnenna Amobi wrote in a note on May 1. ""But,"" she added, ""unplanned outages could yet curtail flows and send prices upward.""

At the same time, natural gas supplies from Norway may reach a new record this year. Equinor has been working to increase its capacity, and to reduce bottlenecks by streamlining maintenance work. The mantra within the country's government - often repeated by energy minister Terje Aasland - is that Norway will be a ""stable and long-term supplier of energy"" for decades to come.

It remains to be seen whether that will pan out. With a new wave of LNG from the US and Qatar coming online in the next few years, ""the importance of Equinor and Norway's gas to Europe is going to eventually decline,"" said Christopher Kuplent, Bank of America Corp.'s head of European energy research, noting that Norway will ""find it hard to organically grow its gas production and therefore export substantially more."" The new projects will, he added, ""make it, at least on paper, a little more comfortable for the European gas consumer to negotiate prices down.""

The notion that gas won't disappear anytime soon, a view strongly endorsed by the gas industry, has thrust Norway to the center of the conversation around securing Europe's energy resources. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck -- who is also in charge of climate policy in the region's biggest economy -- made an official visit to Oslo in early January 2023.

EU energy czar Kadri Simson has also visited Norway twice in the past two years.

The notion that gas won't disappear anytime soon, a view strongly endorsed by the gas industry, has thrust Norway to the center of the conversation around securing Europe's energy resources. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck -- who is also in charge of climate policy in the region's biggest economy -- made an official visit to Oslo in early January 2023. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled two months later to Norway's Troll natural gas field, which provides 10% of the continent's supplies.

EU energy czar Kadri Simson has also visited Norway twice in the past two years. Speaking at an event in the Norwegian capital in March, Simson told a hall filled with the country's oil and gas elite that ""the EU continues to count on Norway as a partner for conventional sources,"" and offered her appreciation for its help during the energy crisis.

Because Norway's gas prices are higher than Russia's, there was some fuming after Russian exports shrank about Norway benefiting at Europe's expense. But criticism abated as governments and traders accepted the new market conditions. The non-EU member has never been shy about the importance it places on gas -- Norway has long advocated that gas should place a central role in the bloc's green transition -- and now it is finding more willing counterparts. In late April, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked Norway for enabling his country to become independent of Russian gas ""within just a few months,"" and praised it as ""the perfect partner"" for securing Germany and Europe's supply.

Norway's new role as gas purveyor to Europe has been very profitable -- gas exports hit a record high of 1.4 trillion kroner ($130 billion) in 2022 -- but it has also cast a question mark over Norway's green future. While the country has become a leader in initiatives like the transition to electric vehicles, the recent surge in demand for gas has had the effect of redirecting financial resources and talent back into the oil and gas sector. Organizations such as Greenpeace have expressed concern that Europe's embrace of Norwegian gas could come at the expense of the broader green transition.

And for traders, going all in on Equinor brings a different set of problems.

Equinor's growing relevance in Europe came into sharp focus last summer, when the company announced that maintenance at some of its biggest gas facilities was being extended. Within minutes, gas prices rose almost 20%.

The response was especially intense as traders had mostly been betting that prices would slump. Sluggish demand and the fact that the region's gas inventories would be full by the end of the summer had led them to think that Europe had finally gotten over the worst of the energy crisis. Unusually hot weather on the continent, which normally increases energy use, amplified concern.

The unplanned outages severely reduced Norway's exports for a few weeks and prompted trading desks across the continent to weigh the ""Equinor maintenance effect"" more heavily in their models. As the price of gas became even more exposed to the company's status, traders started to pay closer attention to the daily messages sent out by another Norwegian company, Gassco AS, about changes to maintenance schedules across the country.

Within Equinor, there are ""information barriers and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations so that all market participants can access market sensitive information at the same time,"" a company spokesman said, adding that Gassco acts as a ""neutral and independent system operator.""

Traders were already on alert for surprise outages. Until the end of 2021, Gazprom had mostly been a reliable supplier -- a big reason why gas prices stayed stable over the last decade. When interruptions suddenly started to happen more frequently, prices spiked, triggering the energy crisis.

What nobody knew back then is that reducing gas flows was part of the run-up to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Around November, traders started to account for the loss of Russian supply in their pricing models.

Europe is on a far better footing than it was a year ago, but circumstances remain volatile. Any threat to fuel supply can roil markets, and that, in turn, can have downstream effects: persistent price swings in the natural gas market can encourage industrial companies to limit their fuel usage and push household bills higher. ""Norway is expected to meet more of Europe's gas needs this summer as its facilities bounce back from the extensive maintenance seen last year,"" BloombergNEF's Nnenna Amobi wrote in a note on May 1. ""But,"" she added, ""unplanned outages could yet curtail flows and send prices upward.""

At the same time, natural gas supplies from Norway may reach a new record this year. Equinor has been working to increase its capacity, and to reduce bottlenecks by streamlining maintenance work. The mantra within the country's government - often repeated by energy minister Terje Aasland - is that Norway will be a ""stable and long-term supplier of energy"" for decades to come.

It remains to be seen whether that will pan out. With a new wave of LNG from the US and Qatar coming online in the next few years, ""the importance of Equinor and Norway's gas to Europe is going to eventually decline,"" said Christopher Kuplent, Bank of America Corp.'s head of European energy research, noting that Norway will ""find it hard to organically grow its gas production and therefore export substantially more."" The new projects will, he added, ""make it, at least on paper, a little more comfortable for the European gas consumer to negotiate prices down.""

Moreover, said Equinor's Rummelhoff, a jump in the volumes of liquefied natural gas being imported to Europe recently has already helped ""normalize the market.""

For now, focus within Equinor is on keeping things running as smoothly as possible. ""Do we feel under pressure? We've always felt that,"" remarked Kjetil Hove, the company's head of production in Norway.

Then came news of a leak at Europe's biggest liquefied natural gas plant, located above the Arctic circle in Norway.

The problem -- discovered during a planned test of the facility's safety systems -- was quickly repaired, but not before it caused a momentary spike in the price of natural gas. Back in the Netherlands, it served as an uncomfortable reminder of the power of a single company, Equinor ASA.

In the more than two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy prices soaring, the Norwegian oil and gas giant has quietly picked up the crown that once belonged to Russia's Gazprom PJSC. Norway now supplies 30% of the bloc's gas; Gazprom provided about 35% of all Europe's gas before the war. And of the more than 109 billion cubic meters of natural gas Norway exported to Europe last year -- enough to power Germany until 2026 -- roughly two-thirds was marketed and sold by Equinor.

So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.

Equinor's visibility ""dramatically changed with reduced flows from Russia,"" said Irene Rummelhoff, the company's head of midstream, marketing and processing. ""There was a point in time where [Europe] almost took us for granted. That is no longer the case.""

The company's new prominence has also raised questions about whether European leaders are, once again, putting their countries at risk by relying too heavily on a single supplier. Although Norway is perceived as a steady trading partner with a long and consistent history of delivering energy to Europe, extended outages and its handling of maintenance challenges, both of which affect energy prices, have had ripple effects across the continent.

Part of the company's good fortune has to do with a broader shift in Europe's relationship to fossil fuels, Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, chief analyst for sustainable finance at Nordea Bank Abp, said in an interview.

Fast forward to today, along with fellow companies of the same league, Shell is writing a chapter that could position the oil and gas industry as the fourth major adopter of Additive Manufacturing. Angeline Goh, 3D Printing Technology Manager at Shell, takes us through a journey rich in lessons, collaborations and hope for the future.

As you probably already know, healthcare, aerospace and automotive are the major adopters of AM. If AM is continuously opening up new applications across these industries and more, the technology's ability to respond to a billion-dollar problem, at multiple levels can be enough to position the oil and gas industry as another source of growth for the technology. That problem is supply chain uncertainty.

Unused or outdated parts take up storage space, resulting in increased inventory costs. Added to that the inability to identify and track obsolete spares, operational downtime, or safety and regulatory compliance, one may understand why oil and gas industries are riding a costs roller-coaster.

Since Covid-19, AM has emphasized its ability to address these challenges, giving oil and gas companies like Shell the chance to make the most of their resources - in-house, they have powder DED, SLM, SLS, SLA, FDM, Multi-jet fusion across a fleet of about 15 3D printers in Amsterdam and India:

""Today, we are using 3D printing to print obsolete spare parts on demand for our assets; develop novel equipment and rapidly prototype engineering designs. By developing an in-house capability, we want to bridge the gap between 3D printing manufacturers and the energy industry, and also become informed users of the service externally,"" Goh explains.

While these resources supported the production of medical equipment during the Covid-19 pandemic, and in some development projects like the one conducted with the OEM B.F.E Bonney Forge, Shell does not aim to become a manufacturer. Just like Equinor, the company believes in a new digital inventory ecosystem, whereby it is important that manufacturing of spare parts for their asset is done locally as much as possible, leveraging qualified 3 party local service providers to provide true lead time reduction and sustainability gains. As such, they only use their facilities for internal R&D and asset support projects.

Key areas of interest and collaborations

""There isn't a typical day at work for us in the 3D Printing [unit] when it comes to R&D alongside asset support, but there are 5 broad categories of work that keep me busy, and the allocation of time to the categories may vary from day to day,"" Goh said before listing:

Needless to say, the challenges may differ from one project to another, but one common thread in their job is that given the high standards of the energy industry for health, safety and environmental concerns, the introduction of any new technology needs to be thoroughly proven by robust and comprehensive testing and adequate data points.

Taking the example of the work they are doing with Kongsberg Ferrotech, Equinor, SINTEF, and Gassco, to develop 3D printing technologies for subsea equipment repair and maintenance, she explains:

""This is certainly a challenge for example, when there are no AM standards for hyperbaric and mobile applications.

The team has to harmonize applicable standards for the scope of repair, and we are working in close collaboration with vendors, operating companies and the class societies to achieve that. In this process of introducing AM-based subsea repair, it is important to identify and manage the risks as we go about engaging our assets that are candidates as pathfinders. In this way, we then build confidence in the whole value chain. A comprehensive qualification program with participation from the inventor and manufacturer to the first user asset is required to demonstrate the quality and value of subsea AM repairs.""

In this vein, in Goh's view, enhancing quality management would drastically improve the way we source 3D-printed spare parts across the industry but not only. Improved lead time, costs and acceptance for AM also require a focus on data and people.

As far as data are concerned, ""improvement leveraging online quality monitoring data for defect detection and quality control that reduces the amount of post-manufacturing testing"" should be a key area of focus for the industry as it ""is important to achieve higher-right-first time prints and reduce overall lead time and cost of the technology.""

Furthermore, I like the idea that Goh puts people at the heart of change. Let's be honest. Transformation is notorious for its pitfalls and challenges - but perhaps the most common mistake organizations often make is neglecting the so-called ""soft side"" of change. Goh sees the importance of focusing on people - and collaborations in particular, with end-users ""to upskill the community on knowledge of the technology, to build trust in the technology, as well as manage the changes in work processes related to [its adoption].""

""Similarly, there are advocates for digital inventory in the supplier companies that are original equipment manufacturers. However, even these advocates need support to transform their organizations to the new ways of supplying. Strategy and processes will have to change, and these require effort and attention to be implemented effectively,"" she adds.

Can AM divisions of oil and gas companies do their part in this sustainability journey?

The oil and gas industry is facing increasing demands to clarify the implications of energy transitions for their operations and business models, and to explain the contributions that they can make to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The increasing social and environmental pressures on many oil and gas companies raise complex questions about the role of these fuels in a changing energy economy, and the position of these companies in the societies in which they operate.

While improving the sustainability of its operations is a multi-faceted ambition, Goh reaffirms that Shell is pursuing both immediate and long-term opportunities to mitigate the impacts their operations have on people and the environments they operate in.

While the company's ESG and sustainability journey is a topic that goes beyond her scope of expertise, she remains hopeful on what AM can do - especially when it comes to going beyond the development of novel designs to reduce the emission of operations and the local on-demand spare parts production:

""More can be achieved in improving repeatability and reducing the variation of printer quality, in the development of secure and autonomous transfer of data to remote printers for manufacturing and availability of AM specific datasheet for a wider range of material used by our industry to facilitate on-demand, local manufacturing.""

""Beyond the technical scope, the community can help propel growth in the adoption of the technology by sharing success stories as well as lessons learned on AM applications. There are various platforms for exchanging knowledge and experiences and I am certainly participating in a number of them and hope to see these forums grow. An example of AM community coming together to share experiences and inspire others is a book that I've read and found helpful. It is called the AM Change Management Guide and is published by the Mobility Goes Additive Group (MGA). There is a lot of effort still needed to develop new guidelines and standards requiring contributions from all partners in the AM ecosystem. Published standards would support the development of legislation to support the AM adoption,"" she concludes.",3dadept.com,news,3D ADEPT MEDIA,Kety S.,0.0980392156862746,453129955,1,https://3dadept.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Angeline-Goh-1-scaled.jpg,
