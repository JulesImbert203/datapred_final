It encompasses three prestigious events: the 29th International Caspian Oil and Gas Exhibition - Caspian Oil&Gas, the 12th Caspian International Energy and Green Energy Exhibition - Caspian Power, and the 29th Baku Energy Forum. The Caspian Oil&Gas and Caspian Power exhibitions will be held in the Baku Expo Centre, while the Baku Energy Forum will be held in the Baku Convention Centre, which is built with an ecological concept.

Every year, the Baku Energy Week, comprising three important events, gathers energy industry leaders from across the globe, drawing attention to Azerbaijan. The participation of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, at the opening ceremony of the Baku Energy Week underscores the prestigious status of this event.

The Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan supports the events held within the Baku Energy Week, and the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) acts as the main partner.

Approximately 300 companies from 37 countries have confirmed their participation in the Baku Energy Week. Alongside Azerbaijan, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, India, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Qatar, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States and Uzbekistan participates at the event. The composition of this year's exhibition has been enriched by new companies, constituting 15% of the total participants, with a notable interest in green energy in Azerbaijan. Well-known companies, accounting for 40% of the exhibition space, are also prominently featured.

This year, in 2024, the Baku Energy Week is coinciding with a significant event. This year marks the 30th anniversary since the signing of the ""Contract of the Century,"" a pivotal moment that ushered in a new era in the oil history of the country. This milestone will be duly reflected in the program of the Baku Energy Week. The ""Contract of the Century"" is widely regarded as the bedrock of Azerbaijan's energy strategy. It was established under the guidance of the esteemed politician and statesman, National Leader Heydar Aliyev, and transformed Azerbaijan into one of the world's oil exporters. Hence, it was through the ""Contract of the Century"" that the cornerstone of our independent state's oil strategy was laid.

Concurrently, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Caspian Oil&Gas exhibition. The initiative for Azerbaijan to host international exhibitions was brought forward by Heydar Aliyev, the founder of the Independent Azerbaijan State. In 1994, National Leader Heydar Aliyev supported the initiative to hold Azerbaijan's first specialized exhibition of the oil and gas industry. Ever since then, the Caspian Oil&Gas exhibition has become a gathering place for top professionals in the field of oil, gas and energy.

Letters of greeting were sent to the participants from the leaders of the USA, the UK, and Türkiye. Heads of state institutions, energy companies, and diplomatic missions of foreign countries to Azerbaijan actively partake in the Baku Energy Week. It is anticipated the attendance of high-ranking dignitaries at this year's Baku Energy Week: Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technologies of the United Arab Emirates, Managing Director of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), Chairman of Masdar Company, and President of COP28, Alparslan Bayraktar, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources of the Republic of Türkiye, Peter Szijjarto, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, Csaba Lantos, Minister of Energy of Hungary, Harry Kemian, Senior Adviser on Multilateral Energy Diplomacy at the US Department of State's Bureau of Energy Resources, Haysam Al-Qais, Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Cristina Lobillo Borrero, European Commission Director General for Energy, Mohamed Hamel, Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), Francesco La Camera, Director General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Atsuko Hiroshe, Acting Secretary General of the International Energy Charter, Angela Wilkinson, Secretary General and Executive Director of the World Energy Congress, Abdulbaqi K AlSalait, energy adviser to the Iraq Ministry of Oil, Tina Sersen, State Secretary for Energy at the Ministry of Ecology, Climate and Energy of the Republic of Slovenia, Abdelkrim Aouissi, Secretary General of the Algerian Ministry of Energy and Mines, and Gordon Birrell, Executive Vice President of Production & Operations for bp.

By bridging traditional energy sectors with emerging green energy fields, Baku Energy Week serves as a platform for pioneering achievements and best practices in this domain. Thus, in 2024, Baku Energy Week coincides with another important event. By the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, 2024 was declared the "" Green World Solidarity Year "" in Azerbaijan. This notable event will be reflected in the program of events of the Baku Energy Week.

In recent years, Azerbaijan has become recognized as a centre where international business events are organized. Azerbaijan actively participates in congress and exhibition activities and has a developed infrastructure. Entrusting Azerbaijan with the organization of such a prestigious event as the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - COP29, corroborates once again the status of the country as a successful organizer of international and large-scale events in the world. As Baku Energy Week gathers energy industry stakeholders ahead of this landmark event, it reaffirms Azerbaijan's pivotal role in the energy sector and its contribution to global energy security.

Baku Energy Week serves as a platform where current issues in the energy sector are discussed, and important parties in the energy industry come together. This event attracts international representatives and organizations to discuss energy security, energy production, transportation, and other critical global issues. Events, projects, and conferences held during the Baku Energy Week help establish new cooperation in the field of energy, exchange experiences, and determine new directions of development.

The Caspian Oil&Gas exhibition will focus on major oil and gas projects in the Caspian region and energy security in the region. Important topics covered by the exhibition include the development of oil and gas fields, oil and gas transportation and production, telecommunications and IT, oil and gas processing, construction and installation works in the energy sector, and innovative technologies, among others. The exhibition will also showcase innovations in artificial intelligence, the drilling sector, as well as the production and storage of oil and non-gas products.

At the Caspian International Energy and Green Energy exhibition - Caspian Power, innovations in the field of development and use of energy and renewable energy sources by international and local companies, as well as any related proposals will be on the agenda. Solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, thermal energy, nuclear energy, engineering and energy equipment, electric vehicles and electric cars, energy and resource-saving technologies, as well as the other topics will be discussed at the exhibition.

A series of sessions and panel discussions will also take place within the framework of the exhibition. Throughout the course of the exhibition days, panel discussions will be held on the topics of "" Breaking the mold: Reshaping energy solutions"", ""New technologies and digitalization"", ""Paving the Way Forward: The Future with Eco-Cars and the Increasing Popularity of Electric Vehicles in Azerbaijan"", ""Radiation safety during the transport of radioactive materials"", ""Pioneering AI in Energy"", ""Challenging to inspect pipelines - An update on in-line inspection methods and technology"", ""Carbon accounting in the gas value chain and how trends will shape carbon markets of the future"", as well as "" The role of women in the oil and gas sector of Azerbaijan"".

Yet another prestigious event to also be organized within the framework of the Baku Energy Week is the Baku Energy Forum. Energy issues crucial to both Azerbaijan and the Caspian region as a whole will be on the agenda at the forum. Customarily, more than 600 delegates are expected to attend the forum. At this year's event, topics such as "" International Cooperation for Energy Security and Sustainability"", ""Energy security 2.0"", ""International Cooperation for Energy Security and Sustainability"", "" New Technologies and Digitalisation"", ""Gas dialogue: The role of gas supply during the energy crisis"", "" Exploration and Production Opportunities in the Caspian Region"", "" Oil Flows: Cross-Logistics and Infrastructure Development in Azerbaijan"" and "" The role of human capital in a successful energy transition"" will be discussed. On the eve of COP29, a special session called "" Empowering and accelerating green transition: strategies for COP29 and for Green World"" was also added to the program of the Baku Energy Forum. Special guests from other countries were invited to participate in the session as speakers.

Environmental issues and the threats they pose to the Earth, along with strategies for their prevention, as well as topics such as green energy, hold a prominent place in the program of events within the Baku Energy Week. Embracing the ""Zero Waste"" principle, aimed at waste prevention, the use of printed media will be minimized during the 2024 Baku Energy Forum, with a preference for electronic media. Additionally, in alignment with the international ""Zero Food Waste"" initiative, optimal food usage principles will be applied during the forum.

Additionally, as part of the Baku Energy Forum, the start-up ""Ecoleaf,"" established by students of the ""MiniBoss"" school, will be showcased. The concept behind this start-up revolves around pencils with seeds embedded in their heads and notebooks containing plant seeds. These eco-friendly products will be presented to forum participants.

Additionally, traditional bilateral business meetings (B2B, B2G) will take place during the events of Baku Energy Week. Here, representatives from local and foreign companies will have the opportunity to engage in face-to-face discussions regarding potential cooperation and future partnerships.

Additionally, within the framework of the event, the foyer of the Baku Expo Center will feature an exhibition including a semi-submersible drilling rig maket named after Heydar Aliyev, collection of digital images from the author of digital content ""Mədəni"" and handcrafted pieces made by students from the Design Faculty of the Western Caspian University.

The event attracts many sponsors. This year's sponsors of Baku Energy Week, whose key partner is SOCAR, includes the companies ""ABB"", ""ACWA POWER"", ""ADNOC"", ""AIQ"", ""Ansaldo Energia"", ""AZFEN"", ""Baku Steel Company"", ""bp"", ""Caspian Drilling Company"", ""Caspian Marine Services"", ""Deloitte & Touch"", ""GAP Construction"", ""GL"", ""INPEX"", ""John Wood Group PLC"" (""Wood""), ""KOLIN Construction"", ""Masdar"", ""MOL Group"", ""Nobel Energy"", ""Photomate"", ""Saudi Aramco"", ""SEE BREEZE"", ""SLB"", ""TEKFEN"", ""TotalEnergies"", ""Türkiye Petrolleri"", ""Uniper"" and ""Ural Steel"". The ""Boston Consulting Group"" company acts as an intellectual partner of the Baku Energy Forum.

The organizers of the event are ""Iteca Caspian"", ""Caspian Event Organizers"" and their international partners ""ICA Events"", ""CEM FZ LLC"". Baku Energy Week is actively supported by the Association of Azerbaijan Exhibition Organizers (ASTA) in 2024, similarly to last year. The companies ""AzExpoMontage"" LLC, ""Caspian Freight Services"", ""Ateshgah Insurance"", ""Hyatt Regency Baku"", ""Ibis Baku City"", ""Radisson Hotel Baku"", ""Lilac"" and ""Greenwich Travel Club"" act as official partners to the event.

Swiss landmark decision on the admissibility of intra-EU investment arbitration

By Michael Feit Dr. iur., LL.M., Attorney at Law Partner Direct phone: +41 58 658 55 08 [email protected]

and Francesca Borio MLaw, Attorney at Law Senior Associate Direct phone: +41 58 658 57 61 [email protected]

The legal and political backdrop or the ""crusade"" of the EU against investment arbitration

In March 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decided in Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V. that the arbitration clause contained in the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between the Netherlands and Slovakia was incompatible with EU law. This judgment steered EU law into collision course with investment arbitration.

In May 2020, 23 EU member states signed the Agreement for the termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties between the Member States of the European Union (Termination Agreement), by which all intra-EU BITs between the signatories were terminated. In the Termination Agreement, the signatories confirmed that intra-EU BIT arbitration clauses were ""contrary to the EU Treaties and thus inapplicable"".

The CJEU rendered further judgments confirming the incompatibility of intra-EU investment arbitration clauses with EU law, namely Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy LLC in September 2021 (regarding the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)), Republic of Poland v. PL Holdings Srl in October 2021 (regarding ad hoc arbitration), and the DA v. Romatsa et al. decision in September 2022 (regarding the unenforceability of the Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula et al. v. Romania ICSID award).

In April 2024, the European Parliament voted for a withdrawal of the EU from the ECT.

Most recently, Spain (the appellant before the Swiss Supreme Court (Court)) announced in May 2024 in the State Official Gazette its withdrawal from the ECT. This decision was taken after investors had initiated numerous arbitrations against Spain in relation to its renewable energy reforms.

The Swiss landmark decision

By decision 4A_244/2023 dated 3 April 2024, the Court upheld jurisdiction of a Swiss seated ad hoc arbitral tribunal over a claim brought by a French investor against Spain under the ECT.

In the arbitration proceeding, Spain objected that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear a claim between an investor from an EU member state and an EU member state. The tribunal dismissed the objection, and Spain filed a set-aside application before the Court.

In its introductory remarks, the Court commented that for several years now, EU bodies had been waging a ""crusade against international arbitration"" regarding intra-EU disputes. The Court did not mince words in its decision.

The Court noted that state courts outside of the EU have no obligation to adhere to EU law. Therefore, decisions rendered by the CJEU, and thus also the Komstroy judgement, are not binding on a Swiss court deciding on a set-aside application against an award rendered by a Swiss seated tribunal.

The Court further stated that it generally accepts the opinion expressed by the supreme court of the state that enacted

the foreign law in question. However, the Court is more reluctant to do so when the question arises whether the rules adopted by a community of states, such as the EU, take precedence over rights deriving from a multilateral treaty, such as the ECT. In case of a conflict between these rules, the community of states may be tempted, as in Komstroy, to assert the primacy of its own law over that of the multilateral treaty.

Following a detailed analysis, the Court concluded that the unconditional consent given by Spain in the arbitration clause contained in Article 26 ECT did not exclude intra-EU disputes.

The Court also rejected the notion that there was a conflict between Article 26 ECT and EU law. The Court was not convinced by the reasoning given in Komstroy, noting that it was essentially, if not exclusively, based on the requirement to preserve the autonomy of EU law, without taking any account of international law or the rules of interpretation of treaties.

The Court continued that even if Article 26 ECT were incompatible with EU law, nothing under public international law would suggest that EU law should take precedence over the ECT.

In conclusion, the Court dismissed the set-aside application.

Recent trends and the impact of the decision

Without being exhaustive, the following trends can be observed inside and outside of the EU:

Arbitral tribunals routinely confirm their jurisdiction in intra-EU disputes. By way of example, in the ICSID arbitration Adria Group B.V. and Adria Group Holding B.V. v. Croatia, the tribunal rejected in October 2023 Croatia's objection that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the investors' claims

arising out of the Croatia-Netherlands BIT. The notable exception to the rule constitutes Green Power Partners K/S and SCE Solar Don Benito APS v. Spain, in which the tribunal declined its jurisdiction under the ECT because it was an intra-EU dispute.

State courts within the EU are expected to deny the existence of a valid arbitration agreement in intra-EU disputes. In Germany, for example, a party can prior to the constitution of the tribunal request a state court to declare the arbitration proceedings inadmissible. On that basis, and upon application by Croatia, the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt declared a German-seated UNCITRAL arbitration brought by Austrian investors under the Austria-Croatia BIT inadmissible.

Pursuant to the German Supreme Court, a party can even file such an application against ICSID arbitrations brought under the ECT. In line therewith, German courts declared the ICSID arbitrations Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd and others v. Germany, Uniper SE, Uniper Benelux Holding B.V. and Uniper Benelux N.V. v. Netherlands and RWE AG and RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV v. Netherlands inadmissible.

Similarly, state courts within the EU have set aside awards on intra-EU grounds (such as in the matters Triodos SICAV II v. Spain, Norvenergia II - Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v. Spain and PL Holdings in Sweden) and have refused to enforce intra-EU ICSID awards (such as in the matter Micula in Luxemburg and Sweden).

However, when enforcement actions are brought outside of the EU, EU state courts tend not to interfere. By way of illustration, the Landgericht Essen dismissed in April 2024 Spain's request for an anti-enforcement injunction to

prevent the enforcement of the intra-EU ICSID award in RWE Innogy GmbH and RWE Innogy Aersa S.A.U. v. Spain in the United States, holding that no obligation exists under the CJEU case law to resist enforcement of ICSID awards outside of the EU.

State courts outside of the EU generally allow enforcement of intra-EU awards, even though there are some uncertainties.

In recognition and enforcement proceedings of an ICSID award under the ECT in the United Kingdom, the High Court ruled in Infrastructure Services and Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Spain that the EU Treaties and the Achmea and Komstroy judgments do not trump pre-existing treaty obligations under the ICSID Convention. Therefore, EU law does not constitute a legal basis to refuse the enforcement of ICSID awards.

In the United States, two district judges rendered opposing decisions with regard to Spain's request to dismiss the investors' petitions to enforce awards based on the case law of the CJEU. One district court judge rejected Spain's intra-EU objection with regard to the two ICSID awards 9REN Holding S..R.L. v. Spain and NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. v. Spain. In contrast thereto, the other district court judge dismissed the petition to enforce the award rendered by an ad hoc Geneva seated UNCITRAL tribunal in Blasket Renewable Investments LLC v. Spain. The three enforcement proceedings are currently pending before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

In this context, what is the potential impact of the Court's decision? A number of commentators criticized the CJEU for limiting its analysis to EU law. The Court, however, conducted a broader international law assessment and its decision has been widely lauded as wellreasoned. State courts outside of the EU

2

faced with set-aside and enforcement requests might, therefore, take guidance by the decision of the Court. The decision could, thus, further tip the scale in favor of upholding jurisdiction and enforcement.

Conclusion

Within the EU, intra-EU disputes face, as some commentators noted, a hostile environment. Outside of the EU, however, the recent decision of the Court confirms the trend that intra-EU investment arbitrations are viewed as valid and enforceable. EU investors are, therefore, well advised to place the seat of the arbitration and to seek enforcement in a non-EU state. To increase protection, however, investors should consider taking proactive steps by structuring their investments within the EU through a non-EU state. Switzerland with its leading investment protection network is an excellent choice.

Prospects have brightened for green reforms to a controversial international treaty that protects fossil fuel investments, as ministers of European Union states agreed on Thursday that countries can still choose to support the reforms despite the bloc's decision to quit the pact.

In a statement, a gathering of EU ministers called the Council of the EU said the decision ""unlocked the process of modernisation of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) for its non-EU contracting parties"".

The compromise allows the EU as a body to withdraw from the treaty, while individual EU member states can stay in and approve the green reforms at a conference due to take place this year, if they wish.

The ECT currently allows all energy companies - including coal, oil and gas firms - to sue governments over climate and other policies they see as a threat to their current and future profits.

The proposed reforms to modernise the ECT, which are due to be voted on in November, would make it easier for ECT countries to prevent the treaty being used as a basis for lawsuits involving fossil fuel assets that are affected by green economy measures.

However, with several European countries already filing their notice to leave the ECT, it is unclear whether a sufficient number of EU states will stay in the treaty long enough to get the reforms approved. As part of today's EU Council agreement, the EU confirmed it would leave the treaty.

Other ECT member states, including Japan and Kazakhstan, only grudgingly agreed to back the reforms under pressure from the European Commission.

For the ECT ""modernisation"" proposal to be adopted, none of the treaty's member governments - now numbering 49 - must vote against it at November's conference. Then three-quarters of ECT members need to ratify the reforms for them to take effect.

If the reforms fail, the ECT's members across Europe and Asia will be unable to remove its protection for fossil fuel investments and - due to a 20-year sunset clause - even EU countries that have left would be exposed to lawsuits for that period.

Post-Soviet treaty

The ECT was conceived in the 1990s to boost investment flows between Western and post-Soviet countries. But its provisions to deter states from grabbing private assets have since been used by energy companies to fight back against climate policies.

In 2020, a British oil and gas company sued Slovenia over what it called ""unreasonable"" environmental protections"", while German energy company Uniper threatened to sue the Dutch government for €1 billion ($1.1bn) over its coal phase-out plans.

In lawsuits brought under the ECT last November, British oil company Kelsch is suing the EU, Germany and Denmark for at least 95 million euros ($102m) over a windfall tax on energy firms.

G7 offers tepid response to appeal for ""bolder"" climate action

The European Commission reacted to these and other cases by attempting to remove fossil fuels from the list of investments protected by the ECT - with the aim that it would apply only to clean energy assets.

For two years, efforts by EU negotiators were repeatedly blocked by Japan and Kazakhstan. But in June 2022, a ""flexibility mechanism"" was agreed that would allow ECT states to end protection for fossil fuels, as long as no other ECT state objected.

Europe divided

Despite European Commission negotiators finally winning this right, EU member countries were divided on how to apply it.

Governments like France, Spain and Luxembourg wanted to immediately end protection for fossil fuel investments but faced push-back from several Eastern European countries.

They agreed a compromise to stop protection for new fossil fuel investments but to continue it for existing investments for ten years - a decision that angered climate campaigners.

Southern Africa drought flags dilemma for loss and damage fund

Friends of the Earth's Paul de Clerck said at the time it would ""lock the EU in fossil fuel investment protection"" for a decade.

Despite this agreement, by the time the annual ECT conference came around in November 2022, EU governments no longer unanimously backed the reforms the European Commission had negotiated, and so they were shelved.

Locking in Asian fossil fuels

The EU's stalling on the reforms drew an angry response from then head of the ECT secretariat, Guy Lentz of Luxembourg.

In a letter to the leader of the European Parliament in February 2023, he warned that if the EU withdrew as a bloc before approving the modernisation, it would amount to ""an express prohibition"" for other ECT members to better align with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Tensions rise over who will contribute to new climate finance goal

He added that failure to agree reforms would essentially allow fossil fuel companies to sue EU states for longer because of an existing 20-year sunset clause, which means energy companies can bring lawsuits against governments for two decades even after a country leaves the treaty.

EU states wanted to neutralise this sunset clause by agreeing a side deal between themselves not to apply the treaty. But Lentz said these attempts ""may not provide the expected legal certainty"". Campaigners accused him of ""bluffing"".

Numbers game

EU countries then continued to debate among themselves whether to stay in or leave the ECT and - if they withdrew - whether to modernise it before exiting.

Despite the ongoing talks, France, Germany and Poland officially left the ECT in December 2023. Luxembourg and Slovenia will leave in June and October 2024 respectively. Portugal, the UK, Spain and the EU will leave next year.

This debate was resolved today, with EU states' ministers agreeing to a compromise, brokered by the Belgian government. Governments that want to can stay and support the modernisation, but the EU itself can start process of exiting right away.

Belgian energy minister Tinne Van der Straeten said her government had ""worked tirelessly to break this complex deadlock and found a balance acceptable and useful to all"".

The deal essentially makes the reforms contingent on timing and EU countries' commitment to reform.

By November, after Luxembourg and Slovenia exit, there will be 47 ECT member states, including 22 from the EU. Eleven more - including the United Kingdom and Switzerland - are in Europe but not in the EU. Nine others are in Central Asia and three in the Middle East, with Japan and Mongolia the remaining two.

E3G analyst Eunjung Lee said ECT modernisation ""is still uncertain"" but added ""with the EU Council decision today, it is probable that the modernisation might pass, particularly if the voting takes place via correspondence"".

The ECT approved this option in October 2022. It means the conference's chair sets a deadline by which any objections should be sent in.

""This will make things easier than voting at a conference, because unless there is a clear objection, the modernisation will be adopted"".

But even if the reform is approved, Lee said the ratification by three-quarters of countries ""could take forever"".

Decreasing Cost of Electrolysis as an Emerging Technology is Driving Growth in the Clean Hydrogen Market

As renewable energy technologies have advanced and become more affordable over the years, the cost of electrolysis - the process of using renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen - has been steadily decreasing. Electrolysis is a key technology for producing clean hydrogen from water using renewable electricity sources such as solar and wind.

With falling equipment costs and improving electrolysis efficiencies, clean hydrogen produced via electrolysis is becoming an increasingly competitive alternative to hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Various technology improvements and economies of scale are expected to result in continued cost reductions, helping electrolysis based clean hydrogen gain acceptance across more applications.

Stringent Emission Norms is another driver fueling demand for Clean Hydrogen

""We can do a lot of good things on the grid"", said Bernard, one of the main panelists at the event. The recently held Belgrade Energy Forum gathered more than 500 participants from 30 countries from across the globe.

""A regulated market is the most important thing for us to implement all this. So that we are all motivated and so that we can cooperate. Because the energy sector needs smart grids, and a smart grid does not exist without smart users. The grid exists for the participants in the grid,"" in the words of the head of NGEN Group.

More challenges are coming, particularly in cyber security, in the segments of grid digitalization and decentralization, he underscored.

It made sense to establish NGEN Group and operate in the sector only after the establishment of the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E) and the introduction of joint regulations, according to Bernard.

""The grid used to operate top-down - there was the production, and then all users consumed the power. Everything goes in both directions now and big systems will lose their control over the grid. I think it will be discussed a lot,"" he stated.

A tough year for clean hydrogen prospects is giving way to more optimism on projects and demand, writes Pamela Machado

The clean hydrogen sector still lacks tangible progress and final investment decisions (FIDs) for projects remain few and far between, but it is reaching a moment of reckoning essential for market maturity, delegates at the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam said this month.

When asked whether they were more or less positive than a year ago, industry participants gave diverging answers, but there was widespread agreement that progress on clean hydrogen has been slower than expected in what one called ""the year of doldrums"". Increasing material and financing costs, the unstable geopolitical situation and a lack of clarity on regulatory frameworks are just some of the challenges developers have faced.

This is a ""grim environment if you were expecting the Swiss army knife approach"" to work, industry body the Australia Hydrogen Council chief executive Fiona Simon said, alluding to the misguided expectation that hydrogen could be used across all sectors to help decarbonise. ""We are coming to terms"" with the real use and appropriate applications of hydrogen, Simon said, pointing to green steel production. ""We are converging on the same concepts and same policies.""

The industry has reached the point where it is becoming a lot clearer which projects will actually materialise. A greater sense of realism is underpinning discussions, according to Dutch gas company Gasunie chief executive Willemien Terpstra. But delegates widely urged more policy action, especially on the demand side. Spurring on demand will be key to getting to more FIDs, Spanish utility Iberdrola's hydrogen development director, Jorge Palomar Herrero, said. ""We can have great intentions and great projects but without the demand they are not going to happen."" Even in Europe, which has pushed ahead with efforts to stimulate demand, these have not been enough to spur offtake, Herrero said.

Demand-side incentives alone will likely not be enough and eventually there will have to be consumption obligations too, some said. ""Carrots"" may help to reduce project costs and kick-start production, but ""sticks"" will be key, delegates heard. Consumption mandates could accelerate momentum in emerging markets that have big ambitions for exports to future demand centres, World Bank private-sector arm IFC energy chief investment officer Ignacio de Calonje said.

Governments are now ready to act on these requests, according to Brussels-based industry body the Hydrogen Council's director for policy and partnerships, Daria Nochevnik. ""The penny has dropped,"" Nochevnik told Argus, noting that the need for demand-side action was the number one priority outcome of a ministerial-executive roundtable held in Rotterdam this month.

But governments must also remove red tape to speed things up, delegates said. European developers in particular are increasingly frustrated with the paperwork involved in funding applications, German utility Uniper vice-president for hydrogen business development Christian Stuckmann said. Shortening lengthy permitting and funding processes is high on governments' lists, Nochevnik noted.

Some delegates renewed calls for a wider acceptance of ""blue"" hydrogen -- made from natural gas with carbon capture and storage -- to address concerns that, if it is up to renewable hydrogen alone, things will start too late or not at all. There appeared to be widespread consensus that blue hydrogen will have a key role to play, especially in a transitional period, as it can already deliver significant emissions reductions. But there is a ""stigma"" in Europe, industrial gas firm Linde vice-president for clean energy David Burns said. This could hamper its adoption, which many delegates argued the world cannot afford.",argusmedia.com,news,Argus Media,,0.1607843137254903,454269205,1,,eng-9593160

ST. PETERSBURG, May 24. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region has upheld Gazprom Export's claim against the Czech Republic's CEZ banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

In case of violation of the ban, the court ruled to recover 57.7 mln euro from the Czech company in favor of Gazprom Export.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company CEZ a. s. from continuing proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce <...>. In case CEZ a. s. fails to comply with the ruling of the court on this case <...> an award in favor of Gazprom Export LLC [in the amount of] 57,734,000 euros in rubles at the rate of the Bank of Russia will be paid by the company CEZ a. s.,"" the judge said.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that CEZ be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva, and that it be fined if CEZ failed to comply with the judicial act.

It was reported in February 2023 that the Czech energy company CEZ (70% of shares owned by the state) had initiated an arbitration worth $45 mln against Gazprom Export due to a gas shortfall in 2022.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts. The Russian company won all its claims to ban the continuation of legal proceedings abroad.

Gazprom Export has also filed similar lawsuits against Swiss DXT Commodities, French Engie and Czech innogy Energie, with hearings scheduled for May 24 and June 19.",tass.com,news,TASS,,-0.06666666666666665,454235982,1,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,eng-9589934

As of 2020, the majority of hydrogen (∼95%) is produced from fossil fuels by steam reforming of natural gas and other light hydrocarbons, partial oxidation of heavier hydrocarbons, and coal gasification.

Hydrogen produced is mostly used by petroleum refineries and fertilizer producing companies. A total of 99% of hydrogen comes from fossil fuel reforming, as it is the most conventional and cost-effective method. However, it is not beneficial for the environment due to CO2 emission. Green hydrogen is produced from electrolysis. Electrolysis is the method used to produce green hydrogen as it uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and gives out zero carbon emissions. One of the objectives that various nations have set for 2050 is the decarbonization of the earth. The generation of an element like hydrogen, which produces green hydrogen, is one of the key factors in achieving this goal because it now accounts for more than 2% of worldwide CO2 emissions. For instance, the European Union (EU) released a unique hydrogen policy in 2020 that combines initiatives to support green hydrogen generation capacities' rapid growth. By 2023, Florida Power & Light plans to have a 20 MW green hydrogen plant up and running. The 1.75 gigawatts Okeechobee gas-fired plant owned by FP&L will utilize this hydrogen in a 20% blend.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 22. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region upheld Gazprom Export's claim against Austria's OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

The court ruled that the Austrian company will have to pay Gazprom Export if it violates the ban.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company OMF Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce <...>. In case the company OMF Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH fails to comply with the ruling of the Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region <...> an award in favor of Gazprom Export LLC [in the amount of] 575,266,000 euros in rubles at the rate of the Bank of Russia will be paid,"" the judge said.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and that it be fined if it failed to comply with the judicial act.

Gazprom Export's lawyer insisted in court that because of sanctions, the company can not get proper legal representation and justice abroad. In particular, a number of EU law firms refused to work with Russian companies, and an agreement on streamlining the issuance of visas was also canceled. Nevertheless, the OMV representative claimed that no personal sanctions had been imposed against Gazprom Export, and the Austrian company proposed - within the same arbitration court - to transfer the hearings to other jurisdictions (including Dubai or Istanbul), but did not receive any response.

OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH is a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG. In June 2018, an agreement was signed to extend the existing contract between Gazprom Export LLC and OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH to supply Russian natural gas to Austria until 2040. Previously, the contract was signed through 2028.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts. The Russian company won all its claims to ban the continuation of legal proceedings abroad.

Gazprom Export also filed a similar lawsuit against Czech company CEZ, with a hearing scheduled for May 24.",tass.com,news,TASS,,-0.09019607843137256,454081257,1,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,eng-9589934

Eight billion euros are waiting to help rebuild Britain's energy systems - but it could all flow to European rivals unless ministers start making decisions on our future electricity supplies, a leading energy boss has warned.

Mike Lockett, who runs the British assets of Uniper, the giant German state-owned electricity producer which produces 7pc of UK electricity, wants to clean up his fleet of six gas-fired power stations so that the millions of tonnes of CO2 they generate can be captured and buried underground.

But, he says, government delays in making crucial decisions, bringing in legislation and building key infrastructure are putting that investment in peril.

""This is the key challenge we face. We are happy to invest our earnings into decarbonisation. We can provide power generation and carbon capture on our sites.

""But we can only do it when there's the proper infrastructure to take that CO2 away and dispose of it. And we have to have the financial incentive to do it as well.""

Lockett is referring to the UK's three-decade flirtation with carbon capture and storage, a technology which holds out the hope of making fossil fuels clean, but where Britain's green ambition has repeatedly hit the buffers of economic reality.

The UK's first carbon capture project was proposed two decades ago - only for shocked Labour ministers to pull the plug in 2005 when they realised the likely impact on consumer bills.

Labour's Conservative and Lib Dem successors cancelled their own projects in 2012 and again in 2015. Carbon capture, they had all realised, would add an estimated 20pc to power generation costs, hitting consumers or taxpayers right where it hurts.

Carbon capture and storage is, however, an essential technology for reaching net zero, according to the Government's Climate Change Committee. So seven years ago our latest government decided to try again - promising companies like Uniper that this time they meant it.

Today, however, there are still no operating CO2 disposal projects. And that is why Mr Lockett, Uniper's UK chairman, is getting impatient. ""We've got a real sense of momentum, and we've got a target of capturing 20-30m tonnes per annum of CO2.

""But we need to see those next steps. We want to see financial investment decisions finally made on the UK's CO2 transport and storage systems.

""We want to see contracts awarded for carbon capture plants and projects such as our own, and then momentum turned into real action. It's becoming critical.""

What's at stake in simple terms is around €8bn (£6.9bn) set aside by Uniper for investment in low carbon power generation, to be spent by 2030. A chunk could come to the UK but other countries are available.

Uniper is an international energy company that operates roughly 22.5 gigawatts generation capacity across Germany, Holland, Sweden and Hungary, making it one of the world's largest power producers.

Well over half its generation comes from gas and coal - and Uniper has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2040.

Lockett is in a hurry to cut carbon. Later this year he will take a big step towards that goal by shutting down Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Britain's last coal-fired power station, sited just south of Nottingham.

The station is due to close in September, finally ending the UK's reliance on burning coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, to generate electricity.

Since it opened in 1967, Ratcliffe's four massive boiler units have generated 550 terawatt hours of electricity - enough to power the entire nation for around 18 months.

But they also consumed around 16,000 tonnes of coal a day and generated 8-10m tonnes of CO2 a year, making it one of Europe's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.

The UK is still reliant on power stations like Ratcliffe. In January, when the nation was hit by a period of windless, cold weather that left wind farms unable to cope, all four boilers were powered up.

That was, however, probably the last time they will all run - and Mr Lockett's attention is now focused on his remaining fleet of gas-fired power plants.

They include a large but ageing power station at Connah's Quay in North Wales, another equally large one on the Isle of Grain in Kent, and four smaller ones - collectively providing 4-5pc of the UK's electricity.

""We want to decarbonise all our plants using a combination of carbon capture and storage, low carbon fuels, such as hydrogen, or biomethane. We've drawn up plans for each of them and carbon capture storage in the UK market is one of the key routes to do that.""

What's missing, however, is the political leadership and that, says Mr Lockett, is becoming a problem.

At Connah's Quay, for example, the plan is to knock down the existing power station and build a new one, fired by gas but with carbon capture technology to pipe its CO2 emissions out beneath the Irish Sea. The Government has pledged to build those pipes - but so far it hasn't happened.

At Grain, similar technology would collect the CO2 and pump it into ships that would take it to a CO2 graveyard deep under the North Sea. But again there is no kit in place - and with an election looming, little sign of any decisions being taken.

Mr Lockett suggests that such indecision is fatal to big infrastructure projects. ""Many organisations like ours are ready to make big investment decisions, but they need to have confidence that their investments will not be stranded in the future.""

Mike Lockett, who runs the British assets of Uniper, the giant German state-owned electricity producer which produces 7pc of UK electricity, wants to clean up his fleet of six gas-fired power stations so that the millions of tonnes of CO2 they generate can be captured and buried underground.

But, he says, government delays in making crucial decisions, bringing in legislation and building key infrastructure are putting that investment in peril.

""This is the key challenge we face. We are happy to invest our earnings into decarbonisation. We can provide power generation and carbon capture on our sites.

""But we can only do it when there's the proper infrastructure to take that CO2 away and dispose of it. And we have to have the financial incentive to do it as well.""

Lockett is referring to the UK's three-decade flirtation with carbon capture and storage, a technology which holds out the hope of making fossil fuels clean, but where Britain's green ambition has repeatedly hit the buffers of economic reality.

The UK's first carbon capture project was proposed two decades ago - only for shocked Labour ministers to pull the plug in 2005 when they realised the likely impact on consumer bills.

Labour's Conservative and Lib Dem successors cancelled their own projects in 2012 and again in 2015. Carbon capture, they had all realised, would add an estimated 20pc to power generation costs, hitting consumers or taxpayers right where it hurts.

Carbon capture and storage is, however, an essential technology for reaching net zero, according to the Government's Climate Change Committee. So seven years ago our latest government decided to try again - promising companies like Uniper that this time they meant it.

Today, however, there are still no operating CO2 disposal projects. And that is why Mr Lockett, Uniper's UK chairman, is getting impatient. ""We've got a real sense of momentum, and we've got a target of capturing 20-30m tonnes per annum of CO2.

""But we need to see those next steps. We want to see financial investment decisions finally made on the UK's CO2 transport and storage systems.

""We want to see contracts awarded for carbon capture plants and projects such as our own, and then momentum turned into real action. It's becoming critical.""

What's at stake in simple terms is around €8bn (£6.9bn) set aside by Uniper for investment in low carbon power generation, to be spent by 2030. A chunk could come to the UK but other countries are available.

Uniper is an international energy company that operates roughly 22.5 gigawatts generation capacity across Germany, Holland, Sweden and Hungary, making it one of the world's largest power producers.

Well over half its generation comes from gas and coal - and Uniper has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2040.

Lockett is in a hurry to cut carbon. Later this year he will take a big step towards that goal by shutting down Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Britain's last coal-fired power station, sited just south of Nottingham.

The station is due to close in September, finally ending the UK's reliance on burning coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, to generate electricity.

Since it opened in 1967, Ratcliffe's four massive boiler units have generated 550 terawatt hours of electricity - enough to power the entire nation for around 18 months.

But they also consumed around 16,000 tonnes of coal a day and generated 8-10m tonnes of CO2 a year, making it one of Europe's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.

The UK is still reliant on power stations like Ratcliffe. In January, when the nation was hit by a period of windless, cold weather that left wind farms unable to cope, all four boilers were powered up.

That was, however, probably the last time they will all run - and Mr Lockett's attention is now focused on his remaining fleet of gas-fired power plants.

They include a large but ageing power station at Connah's Quay in North Wales, another equally large one on the Isle of Grain in Kent, and four smaller ones - collectively providing 4-5pc of the UK's electricity.

""We want to decarbonise all our plants using a combination of carbon capture and storage, low carbon fuels, such as hydrogen, or biomethane. We've drawn up plans for each of them and carbon capture storage in the UK market is one of the key routes to do that.""

What's missing, however, is the political leadership and that, says Mr Lockett, is becoming a problem.

At Connah's Quay, for example, the plan is to knock down the existing power station and build a new one, fired by gas but with carbon capture technology to pipe its CO2 emissions out beneath the Irish Sea. The Government has pledged to build those pipes - but so far it hasn't happened.

At Grain, similar technology would collect the CO2 and pump it into ships that would take it to a CO2 graveyard deep under the North Sea. But again there is no kit in place - and with an election looming, little sign of any decisions being taken.

Mr Lockett suggests that such indecision is fatal to big infrastructure projects. ""Many organisations like ours are ready to make big investment decisions, but they need to have confidence that their investments will not be stranded in the future.""

Continuity is key for the election too. ""The key thing for us is whatever happens in the election we need to see consistency of policy. We need to see whoever's in government continuing those policies and ploughing ahead with decarbonisation.""

What if they don't? ""We are really positive about our investments in the UK. But we've also got other core markets - and they are looking for investment too.""",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!

However, Oskarshamn 1&2 were permanently closed in 2016 and 2017 resulting in hydrogen overcapacity. OKG has modernised the hydrogen plant to expand operations and signed its first contract to supply hydrogen from the plant to industrial gases company Linde in 2022.

""Great that the surplus production we sell can help Hynion with hydrogen for their hydrogen gas stations so that together we can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions,"" said OKG CEO Johan Lundberg. All operations in Uniper's portfolio have two main tasks: ensuring a secure energy supply and driving the energy conversion.

That might change with the help of President Joe Biden's climate law.

Ammonia production is a carbon-intensive process that uses fossil fuels to make the pungent-smelling chemical, which is often used to make fertilizers. But some companies think it could also as a carbon-free fuel for cargo ships or to generate electricity.

Its climate stakes are massive. But so is its potential for clean energy -- because it doesn't release any carbon emissions at the point of use.

A Danish company named Topsoe is planning to build a factory in Virginia that will produce electrolyzers, a device that can make clean hydrogen when powered by solar or wind energy. The electrolyzers will be installed at a new plant in Texas that plans to use the hydrogen to make ""green ammonia,"" which will be sold to a German power company. The Inflation Reduction Act is driving the investments for both facilities by offering billions of dollars through advanced energy programs.

Ammonia production accounts for roughly 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That alone could make the greening of ammonia a massive climate prize. But some experts see bigger solutions: In addition to decarbonizing ammonia for fertilizer, it could also be used to nearly eliminate emissions from oceangoing cargo ships and to replace natural gas and coal in electricity generation.

""We are seeing remarkable progress on these things,"" said Julio Friedmann, an expert on green ammonia and chief scientist at Carbon Direct, which advises companies about reducing their emissions. ""Fundamentally, companies and governments are taking this stuff very seriously. It is across the board.""

The Inflation Reduction Act, with its $370 billion in climate funding, has put the U.S. on the front lines of cleaning up the ammonia industry. A New York-based startup called First Ammonia initially planned on building its first green ammonia plant in Europe. But it changed course after Russia invaded Ukraine and Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, in 2022.

The company settled on Texas for its first facility, thanks to the state's abundance of renewable energy and its industrial infrastructure along the Gulf of Mexico. It's set to break ground at the Port of Victoria later this year on a plant that can produce 300,000 tons of ammonia annually. The company announced a partnership last year to sell ammonia to Uniper, a German power company.

The operation has been made possible in large part due to the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy tax credits.

""It significantly reduces the price point at which we need to sell our ammonia to be able to be productive,"" said First Ammonia CEO Joel Moser in an interview. ""So it's a huge step.""

The company sees maritime shipping and electricity generation as growth markets for ammonia, fueling cargo ships and supplementing wind and solar in the power sector.

""That's an ideal future, a future where we've electrified all that we can and the things we can't we're using hydrogen application, specifically ammonia,"" Moser said.

Roughly 180 million tons of ammonia is sold globally every year for more than $100 billion. About 70 percent of it is used for fertilizers, according to the International Energy Agency.

Ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, is historically carbon intensive, and the production of hydrogen is particularly dirty. It relies on using natural gas or coal and accounts for more than 90 percent of the emissions associated with ammonia production, according to a 2022 paper by the Innovation for Cool Earth Forum. By the IEA's estimate, ammonia production is about two times as emission intensive as producing crude steel.

Green hydrogen has emerged as a key to cleaning up ammonia. Electricity is used to split a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen. If wind or solar technologies are used to supply that power, it is considered ""green"" hydrogen. It has a variety of potential uses, but ammonia production is among the most promising. The consulting firm Wood Mackenzie estimates that roughly 39 percent of announced green hydrogen projects globally would be used to make ammonia, though the firm thinks many of those projects won't be built.

That is where Topsoe, the Danish industrial company, comes in. While not a household name in the U.S., Topsoe is a major player in the chemical industry. The company estimates that a third of global ammonia is made using its technologies. Nearly all of that was traditionally done by using fossil fuels.

But the company is starting to pivot. Armed with a $136 million Inflation Reduction Act tax credit from the Energy Department, Topsoe is planning to build a $400 million electrolyzer factory in Chesterfield, Virginia. Its plans are subject to completing a DOE certification process that can take up to two years. First Ammonia is the company's first customer.

The move to build electrolyzers is a part of a wider shift for Topsoe. Cleaner technologies like biodiesel now account for about a fifth of its revenue, up from nothing four years ago, said Topsoe CEO Roeland Baan. The company is also building a second electrolyzer facility in Denmark.

""We have this enormous portfolio of products and technologies that are useful for the energy transition, and so we decided to make a big pivot,"" Baan said in an interview. ""And we set our vision to be recognized as a leader in decarbonization technologies.""

Green ammonia producers have several factors working in their favor. A global network of ports, ships and pipelines already exist to ship ammonia. The gas is considered a clean fuel because it lacks carbon molecules.

Japan has committed to using green ammonia to help decarbonize its power sector by co-blending it with coal. The government hopes to reach 100 percent ammonia electricity generation by midcentury. The move has encountered resistance from environmental groups, which say using ammonia could extend the life of coal plants.

An even bigger prize may be the marine shipping industry, which releases 2 percent of global emissions. Shipping companies are experimenting with new vessels that burn a blend of diesel and ammonia. Maersk, the international shipping giant, recently ordered four ammonia-fueled vessels with the potential to buy six more. Trafigura, another large shipper, recently ordered six ships.

But hurdles remain. Ammonia has a high ignition temperature; that's one reason it is often blended with another fuel. It is also corrosive. Green ammonia remains more expensive to produce than its fossil fuel-made counterparts. And while burning ammonia doesn't emit carbon dioxide, controls are needed to curtail emissions of another air pollutant, nitrogen oxide.

Current and former Biden administration officials said the tax credits awarded to Topsoe reflect a shift in the government's approach on those issues. DOE has long supported early stage technological research. But the department under Biden is providing additional assistance to companies that are trying to make the jump from the laboratory to the marketplace.

Topsoe was one of 35 projects that received $1.93 billion in tax credits under DOE's Advanced Energy Project Credit. The credits are part of a multifaceted approach, said Costa Samaras, a former Biden administration official who now leads the Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University.

The credits to Topsoe are aimed at reducing the price of building a manufacturing facility, like the company's electrolyzer plant.

It is a testament to our dedication to systematically improving sustainability performance across all facets of our operations and supply chains. I am proud to share the progress we have made.

2023 was an exciting year for Uniper. In August we announced our new strategy:""Accelerating the energy transition: flexible, balanced, bespoke."" Europe wants to reduce its greenhouse- gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Germany aims to be climate-neutral by 2045. Uniper wants to achieve this already by 2040. This is a truly mammoth task. But we consider Uniper to be very well positioned for these changes. We are playing a decisive role in transforming the energy system, which you can read about in this report.

Throughout 2023, we made significant strides in various aspects of sustainability. Uniper was named as one of the world's best employers and earned the gold Pride Champion seal. We carried out several projects that enhance biodiversity and promoted activities that support both the physical and mental health of our employees. We continued to discuss ESG risks and impacts with several international NGOs and high-risk suppliers.

The clean hydrogen sector still lacks tangible progress and final investment decisions (FIDs) for projects remain far and few between, but it is reaching a moment of reckoning essential for market maturity, delegates at the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam said.

When asked whether they were more or less positive than a year ago, industry participants gave diverging answers, but there was widespread agreement that progress on clean hydrogen has been slower than expected.

This has been ""the year of doldrums"", the Dutch port of Rotterdam's hydrogen supply chain programme manager Martijn Coopman said. Increasing material and financing costs, the unstable geopolitical situation and a lack of clarity on regulatory frameworks are just some of the challenges developers have faced.

This is a ""grim environment if you were expecting the Swiss army knife approach"" to work, industry body the Australia Hydrogen Council's chief executive Fiona Simon said, alluding to the -- misguided -- expectation that hydrogen could be used across all sectors to help decarbonise.

""We are coming to terms"" on the real use and appropriate applications of hydrogen, Simon said, pointing to green steel production. ""We are converging on the same concepts and same policies"".

The industry has reached the point where the wheat is separated from the chaff and it is becoming a lot clearer which projects will actually materialise.There is now a greater sense of ""realism"" underpinning discussions according to Dutch gas company Gasunie chief executive Willemien Terpstra. And this is why market participants are more optimistic than a year ago.

Still, delegates widely urged more policy action, especially on the demand side, which has been a recurrent theme.

Spurring on demand will be key to get to more FIDs, Spanish utility Iberdrola's hydrogen development director Jorge Palomar Herrero, said. ""We can have great intentions and great projects but without the demand, they are not going to happen"". Even in Europe, which has pushed ahead with efforts to stimulate demand, these have not been enough to spur offtake, Herrero said.

Demand-side incentives alone will likely not be enough and eventually there will have to be consumption obligations too, some said. Incentives may help to reduce project costs and kickstart production, but the amount of ""carrots"" needed is ""phenomenal"", so ""sticks"" will be key, the port of Rotterdam's Coopman said.

Consumption mandates could help accelerate momentum in emerging markets and developing countries that have big ambitions for exports to future demand centres, the World Bank's private sector arm IFC energy chief investment officer Ignacio de Calonje said.

Governments are now ready to act on these requests, according to industry body the Hydrogen Council's director for policy and partnerships Daria Nochevnik. ""The penny has dropped,"" Nochevnik told Argus, noting that the need for demand-side action was the number one priority outcome of a ministerial-executive roundtable held in Rotterdam this week.

Governments must also remove red tape to speed things up, conference delegates said.

European developers in particular are increasingly frustrated with paperwork involved in funding applications, according to German utility Uniper's vice-president for hydrogen business development Christian Stuckmann.

Shortening lengthy permitting and funding processes is also high on governments' lists, Nochevnik noted.

Some delegates renewed calls for a wider acceptance of ""blue"" low-carbon hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture and storage to address concerns that, if it is up to renewable hydrogen alone, things will start too late -- or not at all.

There appeared to be widespread consensus that this low-carbon hydrogen will have a key role to play, especially in a transitional period, as it can already deliver significant emissions reductions. But there is still a ""stigma"" in Europe, according to industrial gas firm Linde's vice-president for clean energy David Burns. This could hamper its adoption, which many delegates argued the world cannot afford.",argusmedia.com,news,Argus Media,,0.1215686274509804,453654460,1,,eng-9573365

But the government has billions riding on its success.

Today, the bright yellow power plant tucked behind a graffiti-covered fence burns planet-warming gas to produce electricity. But if all goes to plan, it will one day switch to emissions-free hydrogen. It's the first, tiny part of a dream energy system being sketched out by policymakers across Europe, who are banking on the green fuel to meet some of the world's most aggressive climate targets. That dream rests on converting newly built polluting infrastructure to burn hydrogen, a fuel that'll be many times more expensive than natural gas and that no one has figured out how to move safely and cheaply in bulk.

Experts agree that hydrogen will have to play some role in getting the world to net-zero in sectors such as steelmaking, aviation and shipping. The handful of early projects focused on using hydrogen to generate power in Europe, however, show that it won't be as easy a swap as advocates make it out to be.

The Leipzig power plant was inaugurated in October. It was built in just two years, despite pandemic-induced supply chain hurdles, and workers were still applying shiny blue paint to the railings in April. A sheet steel and plastic case houses two Siemens Energy turbines that are supposed to be able to combust 100% hydrogen gas with just a few tweaks.

Leipziger Stadtwerke, the local utility running the project, aims to do its first commercial tests with hydrogen by 2026, according to Christoph Jansen, the company's head of generation. It could be a ""gamechanger,"" he said, for a town that still largely relies on mining lignite, a particularly dirty type of coal.

Germany plans to build more than 20 power plants much bigger than the one in Leipzig, which it advertises as the continent's first ""hydrogen-ready"" facility. They'll be supplied by state-of-the-art liquefied natural gas terminals equipped to handle niche clean fuels such as ammonia, and a network of special pipes stretching roughly 6,000 miles (9,600 kilometers).

It's a tempting solution. Following this model, governments and companies that are racing to meet net-zero deadlines but worried about energy security can still build billions of dollars worth of gas infrastructure as long as it's ""hydrogen-ready."" Nine of the world's 10 biggest carbon polluters have published hydrogen strategies and incentives to grow the fuel's use globally already exceed $360 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

Gas-dependent economies including Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and the UK are among Europe's biggest proponents for using hydrogen and some have plans to use it to generate electricity. But there's no official definition of what makes a plant hydrogen-ready, opening the door for greenwashing. For power plants, burning hydrogen hasn't even been tested at scale.

""There has not yet been any measurable progress in the construction of hydrogen-ready, gas-fired power plants,"" said Eric Heymann, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research.

Then there's the problem of moving hydrogen around. The Leipzig plant isn't hooked up to the grid (and hasn't yet set up own electrolyzers), which means the highly combustible fuel will have to be trucked in until the second part of the government's grand plan comes to fruition. It's building a €1 billion liquefied natural gas terminal in Brunsbuettel, a town along the North Sea, that will initially import LNG but be designed to also handle futuristic clean fuels.

Hydrogen can only be liquefied at -253C (-423F), well beyond the capabilities of today's LNG ships. So Germany is planning to import hydrogen in the form of liquid ammonia, a combination of hydrogen and nitrogen that can more easily be turned into a liquid. But ammonia is toxic and handling requires better ventilation systems. Many components in the terminal, including control valves and fire and gas sensors as well as inline devices -- most of which have not been tested with ammonia -- will also need upgrades, according to Fraunhofer ISI, an energy think tank.

Germany doesn't have an ammonia pipeline network and there are limitations to moving it via trucks on an industrial scale because it's hazardous. That means ammonia will have to be converted back into hydrogen, yet there's no economically viable technology currently available to do that. The terminal's operator said it will discuss alternative strategies if none emerge by next year.

""The German government is making a risky bet here,"" said Jonathan Barth, spokesperson of the German Energy Independence Council. ""Hydrogen should be limited to no-regret applications,"" he said. ""Hoping that all problems can be solved with hydrogen prevents us from starting now where we can.""

Industries can be built from the ground up with enough support. The renewable energy industry was in its infancy 20 years ago and faced skepticism. Now it's booming.

The difference is that wind and solar produce clean electricity -- a commodity the world already uses. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, will require building more solar and wind farms when, in many cases, it would be simpler to just use that clean energy directly. By the time hydrogen is made, stored and burned to make electricity again, there's nearly 70% less energy than at the start -- and the cost has tripled.

Green hydrogen will probably only be useful towards the end of the energy transition, once primary electricity demand is being comfortably met by renewables, according to Pierre Wunsch, Belgium's top central banker. ""We're not going to have green hydrogen in big quantities and cheap prices before that because of course we need to produce more electricity to electrify,"" he said.

That's perhaps why most green hydrogen projects only exist on paper or the websites of major gas companies like Equinor ASA, Shell Plc and Sinopec. A chasm is emerging between the scale of the political ambition and the money on the table from companies to build the projects; just 4% of proposed global projects reached financial close in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. Others are already falling through the gap.

Redcar, a tiny seaside village in the UK known for its long sandy beach and lemon sorbet-topped ice cream cones, was slated to be the site of a hydrogen home heating and cooking pilot last year.

Northern Gas Networks Ltd. pitched it as an easy way to lower energy bills and carbon footprints. It turned out the project would be mandatory, requiring everyone to give up gas and switch to a hydrogen grid. The switch would also result in major, disruptive renovations including a separate set of pipelines and new home furnaces and stoves.

Multiple residents told Bloomberg Green there was no information about how much hydrogen would be available after the trial ended or how much it would cost. After a wave of local protests, the government canceled the project due to a lack of green hydrogen.

""We were open, transparent and honest,"" said Tim Harwood, who runs the hydrogen program at Northern Gas Networks. ""Everything we were going to do was in the best interest of customers.""

That's not how everyone perceived it. Northern Gas was ""selling a lie,"" said Steve Rudd, who asked his tenants to leave the house he owns in Redcar because he didn't want the liability of having them be guinea pigs.

""Hydrogen has been known about for years and it's not been used,"" Rudd said. ""It's energy intensive and it costs more.""

A January review of 54 studies concluded that hydrogen will at best play a niche role in decarbonizing buildings because it's less efficient and more expensive than heat pumps, district heating and better insulation. That hasn't stopped other companies from trying to make it work: There's a home heating trial underway in the Netherlands and another planned in Scotland.

Jan Rosenow, Europe director at the European Regulatory Assistance Project who authored the review, worries the bid to replace gas in buildings with hydrogen is becoming a costly distraction. ""There's a risk the discussion on hydrogen for heating will lead to a delay in the introduction of alternative cheaper and cleaner heating technologies,"" he said.

Hydrogen evangelists readily admit it's possible the world will never produce the green fuel at a low enough price to replace gas. But they're still advocating for the construction of ""hydrogen-ready"" gas infrastructure in the hope that the market catches up.

It's a big gamble. If they're wrong, the world risks locking in decades of fossil fuel pollution and blowing past targets for cutting emissions. Doing so will result in catastrophic climate impacts.

Germany, for example, plans to set aside up to €20 billion to make it economically viable for utilities to transition to hydrogen, as the country will urgently need backup for times when sun and wind are not available amid soaring power demand. If those subsidies don't come through, ""there is a risk that power plants will simply continue to run on natural gas,"" said Claudia Günther, research lead for Germany at think tank Aurora Energy Research.

Despite already scrapping three hydrogen projects, German utility Uniper SE is preparing to build a new fleet of ""hydrogen-ready"" gas plants. Chief Executive Officer Michael Lewis says it's a chicken-and-egg situation. ""Today, of course, it's expensive because there's no infrastructure for hydrogen in place yet and there's no economies of scale,"" he said. Yet with no real chicken or egg to speak of yet, he said at the company's annual general meeting this month that ""in just over six years, our portfolio will change from grey to green.""

Robert Habeck, Germany's economy and climate action minister and Green Party member, says his country has already scaled back its hydrogen plans and is clear-eyed about the challenges.

""Germany needs a lot of hydrogen to help its fossil-fuel-heavy industry on its way towards climate neutrality,'' he said. ""We had to adapt our initial plan of using hydrogen in power plants on a large scale because we had to save costs.""

It's a ""make or break"" year for hydrogen, according to an S&P Global report published last December. The industry is encountering cost increases, with required capital expenditure estimates going up by 40% to 50%. To make headway, companies will need to make 10 to 15 large final investment decisions. The odds of that happening, at least in Europe, could be steep ones.

""The math still doesn't add up,"" said Jean-Christophe Laloux, head of EU lending and advisory operations at the European Investment Bank. ""At the moment, there is no case that we can see for a model based on green hydrogen independently produced and distributed as an energy commodity.""",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Mathew Perry,0.2941176470588236,453621691,1,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/1x-1-48dz3hw9.jpg,

Low-carbon and renewable hydrogen project delays are well documented around the world, with policy uncertainty, cost inflation and difficulty securing competitive offtake agreements common barriers.

A small minority -- around 7% -- of announced global clean hydrogen projects have taken positive final investment decisions, data from S&P Global Commodity Insights showed.

Meanwhile, electrolyzer costs have risen 20%-45% since 2021, according to Commodity Insights analysts.

Those costs were expected to fall by only 15%-30% by 2030, with ""the majority of costs shifting from 'new' technology like electrolysis stacks, to 'standard' balance-of-plant technology such as heat exchangers, pumps, compressors and storage tanks where cost reduction is incremental,"" the analysts said in a recent report.

But there are bright spots, and concrete progress is being made around the globe, albeit at a slower pace than originally envisaged and than developers would like to see.

Incumbent hydrogen producers such as industrial gas companies and fertilizer companies are able to avoid costs associated with developing an entirely new value chain, something many green hydrogen projects are facing.

Some of the largest clean hydrogen projects to have taken positive FIDs are in North America, with two operational carbon capture-enabled plants in Canada and more planned in the US.

Air Products' Louisiana blue hydrogen and ammonia facility is planned to produce over 750 MMcf/day, the company said, capturing 95% of CO2 emissions. The project was expected to come online in 2027.

The company already supplies hydrogen to customers through its Gulf Coast pipeline, where there was ""significant demand for blue hydrogen,"" CEO Seifollah Ghasemi said on an April 30 earnings call.

And in Texas, OCI plans to start up its 1.1 million mt/year blue ammonia project in 2025, capturing and storing up to 1.7 million mt/year of CO2.

However, US project developers are facing similar issues to ones that European peers tackled a few years previously, with uncertainty around policy implementation and details stalling investment decisions.

Proposed tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act offer subsidies of up to $3/kg but require strict additionality criteria for renewables and hourly power matching, criteria that industry representatives say could choke off the industry in its infancy.

""We are already seeing the first examples of customers either deciding to slow down on their green hydrogen efforts or considering blue hydrogen more seriously,"" Ambient Fuels CEO Jacob Susman told Commodity Insights, noting the company was re-evaluating several projects in light of the draft legislation.

Hydrogen production costs via grid-based alkaline electrolysis on the US Gulf Coast averaged $2.60/kg in April, the Platts Hydrogen Price Wall shows, with the renewables requirements adding to that. Platts is part of Commodity Insights.

Public equity markets and banks are the main source of funding for low-carbon projects, according to a Commodity Insights analysis. Securing financing for hydrogen projects is complicated by uncertainty, as guaranteed long term offtake agreements are key.

Some developers though are embracing the tough proposed standards. Hy Stor Energy said the rules would provide the industry much-needed credibility for its potential offtakers.

The company said in March that steelmaker SSAB had been selected to enter federal funding negotiations for a prospective steel plant using 100% green hydrogen from Hy Stor's Mississippi Clean Hydrogen Hub project.

In Europe, the finalization of hydrogen policy and demand mandates has given developers more certainty to underpin economic decisions, while European Commission approval for state support programs is poised to unlock private sector investments.

The EU and national governments such as Denmark and the UK have also awarded first subsidy schemes, and developers are securing offtake agreements from early movers looking to decarbonize operations.

The electrolyzer industry is scaling up, with hydrogen project developers are increasingly focused on medium-sized projects of 100 MW and above that are better placed to weather the cost increases of recent years and take advantage of economies of scale, as well as learnings from smaller pilot and demonstration plants.

Hy24, a joint venture between investment manager FiveT Hydrogen and private equity firm Ardian, is among the backers of Sweden's H2 Green Steel 700-MW hydrogen project, one of the first in Europe to reach FID with agreed loans now in the administrative phase.

Such projects typically do not need third-party funding from either public or private entities and, as a result, can progress more quickly toward FID and construction, executives at electrolyzer supplier Thyssenkrupp Nucera said.

Industry participants said the premium for green hydrogen was a small part of the end steel product cost, with low power costs supporting the business model.

Shell took FID on its 200-MW Holland Hydrogen 1 project in 2022, ahead of securing state support, despite a warning from the Dutch government the move could hamper its subsidy application.

Shell wanted to give certainty to project partners, a company spokesperson told Commodity Insights in April. The project was subsequently approved for receiving government funding under the EU Important Projects of Common European Interest scheme.

The company has also booked 100 MW of electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at ITM Power's factory for its Refhyne II green hydrogen plant at its Rhineland refinery in Germany, though the project is yet to reach FID.

In Saudi Arabia, Air Products is part of the state-backed 2-GW Neom green hydrogen project now in construction, eyeing ammonia exports to global markets.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company has sent a test cargo of blue ammonia from its existing Ruwais plant to Germany, with plans to expand CO2 capture and storage at the site.

Low-cost loans from Indian government companies REC and Power Finance Corp, meanwhile, have helped Indian developers reach financial close on projects.

ACME's 1.2 million mt/year Oman renewable ammonia project is under construction after reaching FID for a first phase with the help of a $487 million loan from REC in July 2023. ACME subsequently secured an offtake agreement with Yara.

ACME, Greenko and Reliance were among winners of India's $2.4 billion hydrogen subsidy plan, and have pledged to accelerate their projects.

ACME also has an offtake agreement with Japan's IHI Corporation relating to its 1.3 million mt/year renewable ammonia project in Odisha, India, with FID expected soon ahead of commissioning by the end of 2026 or early 2027.

Finally, Greenko has deals with Singapore's Keppel and Germany's Uniper, with first shipments foreseen by end-2025, with its Kakinada project in India close to achieving FID, Greenko president Mahesh Kolli told Commodity Insights in February.",spglobal.com,news,spglobal.com,"Ruchira Singh, Daniel Weeks",0.4509803921568627,453529967,1,https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/b3832f10-997f-4da3-b289-e58e29e2911f.png,eng-9561767

Network industries, including electricity, natural gas, rail transportation and telecommunications, consist of potentially competitive activities, such as electricity generation, with naturally monopolistic ones, such as transmission and distribution of electricity. This combination produces a unique set of challenges to competition law and policy in designing a market structure and regulatory framework which maximise the benefits of liberalisation while effectively controlling any tendencies to monopolistic abuse. Mumbai, India where parallel licencing in electricity retail was introduced unintentionally illustrates this challenge.

The Electricity Act 2003 (EA 2003) provides for opening up electricity distribution to the private sector. Section 14 of EA 2003 which allows parallel licencing states that ""the appropriate commission may grant a licence to two or more persons for distribution of electricity through their own distribution system within the same area, subject to the conditions that the applicant for grant of licence. The grant of the licence within the same area, subject to the conditions that the applicant for grant of licence within the same area shall, without prejudice to the other conditions or requirements under this Act, comply with the additional requirements (including the capital adequacy, credit-worthiness, or code of conduct) as may be prescribed by the Central Government, and no such applicant who complies with all the requirements for grant of licence, shall be refused grant of licence on the ground that there already exists a licensee in the same area for the same purpose"".

Parallel licensing in Mumbai was initiated not through policy or a careful reading of Section 14 of EA 2003, but through litigation over power purchase agreements (PPAs) between existing players when EA 2003 was enacted. Analysis of the outcome may be seen both as a muddle or a model for delicencing electricity retail across India in the future.

The ""muddle"" lens of the electricity delicencing experiment in Mumbai exposes sub-optimal outcomes for customers and complex challenges for regulators, who need to balance the interests of the licensees and those of the consumers, and also for the judiciary that has to interpret Section 14 and related provisions of EA 2003. Despite multiple regulatory and judicial interventions since 2008, expected outcome of competitive tariff for consumers has not materialised. In addition, issues of cherry picking of consumers by one distribution licensee (DL) in the area served by the other, disputes over duplication of distribution networks, cherry picking of consumers, use of networks owned by one licensee by the other, and over cross subsidies over use of the distribution network, power purchase agreements (PPAs) continue to persist along with other challenges.

Since the introduction of parallel licencing in 2008, Tata Power Corporation -- Distribution (TPCD) and Reliance Infrastructure Distribution (erstwhile Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited or BSES, later acquired by Reliance Infrastructure limited [Rinfra] which was taken over by Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited [AEML] in 2017), the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport [BEST] and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited [MSEDCL] have indulged in legal conflict over the interpretation of provisions in section 14 of EA 2003.

In 2008, the Supreme Court held that TPCD, that was a bulk supplier of electricity in Mumbai and was entitled to supply electricity in retail, directly to all consumers within its area of supply, as stipulated in its licences following provisions of EA 2003. Subsequently, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) confirmed TPCD as a DL for the entire city of Mumbai, covering the licence areas of both BEST and Rinfra. TPCD's distribution licence was valid up to August 2014. In 2014, TPCD secured a licence to distribute electricity in the entire Mumbai district, part of the Mumbai suburban district and the entire municipal corporation area(legally contested). The distribution licence (DL) was granted for a period of 25 years effective from August 2014 till August 2039. The DL covered an area overlapping the entire licensed area of Rinfra, BEST and MSEDCL.

Historically, TPCD was a power generator and bulk supplier of power in Mumbai. One of the bulk power purchasers with whom TPCD had signed PPAs was Rinfra. This relationship created unique challenges when TPCD entered distribution. As TPCD had access to low-cost power, it was able to offer lower tariffs to consumers in areas where it was a parallel licensee. This facilitated bulk consumers and eventually also domestic consumers to switch suppliers from Rinfra to TPCD. This was an intended outcome. However, TPCD had no incentive to supply power to Rinfra at competitive rates. This imposed additional costs on Rinfra in securing PPAs with alternative suppliers. For its part, Rinfra could impose wheeling charges on TPCD for transporting electricity on behalf of TPCD on its distribution network. These issues were part of the legal conflict between the players in the arena. The prospect of TPCD building its own distribution network, thus duplicating the existing network controlled by Rinfra was another contested issue. The result was a patchwork of temporary solutions imposed by the regulatory and other institutions such as cost plus mechanism for tariff determination. The cost-plus mechanism allowed parallel distributers in Mumbai to source expensive power purchased through short-term power markets and pass on the costs to the consumer. Customer interest was compromised as the cost of power procured through short-term markets was typically higher than that of power purchased through long-term PPAs. Customers also had to bear the risk of uncertainty in tariffs when a large share of the power supplied was procured through short-term markets. Structural barriers such as limitation in transmission capacity limited low-cost power procurement from outside the Mumbai area through competitive bidding. This meant a higher average tariff for consumers. When regulated tariff did not permit full cost recovery, DLs transformed unrecovered costs into regulatory assets, essentially costs recoverable from customers in the future through regulated tariffs. This was not an intended outcome of competition in retail electricity. Seen through the ""muddle"" lens, parallel licensing in Mumbai highlights inequitable outcomes for consumers reflected in high and uncertain tariffs and sub-optimal consequences of regulatory inadequacy reflected in incessant litigation. This is not an outcome that one would expect in Mumbai which exhibits high household density (number of consumers per unit area), a distribution network that is mostly underground that reduces losses, few agricultural consumers and higher household incomes compared to most of the rest of India all of which contribute to lower distribution losses and greater tolerance for higher electricity tariff. And yet parallel licencing has not been a great success.

The ""model"" lens highlights the introduction of private players in electricity distribution and the consequent improvement in the financial and technical efficiency of their operations. Even small improvements in the economic and technical efficiency of operations of private licensees' stands in contrast to the persistent underperformance of state-run distribution companies (discoms) that are forced to carry social burdens (sustaining employment and subsidies). The annual integrated rating and ranking of power sector utilities by power finance corporation (PFC) rates distribution companies on parameters based on (i) financial sustainability (average cost of supply[ACS]-annual revenue realised [ARR], days receivable, days payable to gencos and transcos, adjusted quick ratio, debt service coverage ratio, leverage [debt/earnings before interest, tax and amortization]) (ii) performance (distribution loss, billing efficiency, collection efficiency, corporate governance and (iii) external environment (subsidy realised, loss taken over by state government, government dues, tariff cycle timelines and auto pass-through of fuel costs). In the 12 annual rating and ranking of distribution companies for 2023, six out of the top ten ranks go to private companies and the top rank and rating goes to one of the parallel licensees in Mumbai, Adani Energy Mumbai Limited (AEML). AEML serves 7 divisions of Mumbai city and serves over 3 million retail customers. It has no agricultural consumers and over 14 percent of its customers are from the commercial & industrial segments. AEML had a billing efficiency of 93.7 percent and collection efficiency of 99.8 percent. Its days receivable was 17 and days payable was 38. The aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) in the areas served by AEML fell from 11 percent to about 6 percent over 5 years. AEML also claims that it has increased the share of renewables from 3 percent to over 30 percent with 50,000 green tariff customers. In 2023, applications of Adani Electricity Navi Mumbai (AENML) and Torrent Power Ltd (TPL) were pending before MERC for parallel licences in the jurisdiction of the MSEDCL illustrating the attractiveness of the business for private players.

Since the implementation of parallel licencing in Mumbai, structural issues that contributed to the ""muddle"" have improved substantially. There are a number of options for retail distributers to source power as constraints in transmission have been resolved. This has eliminated the need for cost-plus regulation of tariff. Overall tariff and uncertainty over tariff have reduced for domestic retail consumers. Consumer experience with billing and exercise of choice has also improved substantially with introduction of new technology. Separation of carriage (wires) and content (electricity) is yet to materialise physically but it is functioning in practice with the use of distribution network common to all the DLs who pay wheeling charges. The two private parallel licensees TPCD and AEML have no regulatory assets as of 2022, and their financial sustainability is among the best in the country. However, this does not mean that the parallel licencing muddle is now a model for the rest of the country. Unique features of Mumbai city that include high density with no agricultural consumers, greater incomes that can accommodate higher tariff and a long history of private sector presence in generation and distribution that are critical to accommodating parallel licencing cannot be replicated across the country. In many states agricultural or subsidised consumption of electricity is dominant and incumbent distribution companies are saddled with high levels of debt. The Mumbai model demonstrates the tendency of DLs to ""vertically integrate"" with their own sister concerns that generate power. This has the potential to limit the benefits of competition in retail particularly in the context of reducing tariff. The fact that there is no fully evolved wholesale market for power procurement along with the fact that there is no market for fuels (coal, natural gas, hydro, nuclear, renewables) has limited reduction in tariff, one of the key benefits of competition.

Regulation is necessary, because in most cities or States in India, no more than two or three DLs are likely to compete. This would be oligopolistic competition with limited benefits. The complexities in sourcing power in the early stages of introducing parallel licencing in Mumbai clearly highlights that wholesale competition must be in place before retail competition is introduced across the nation. In the case of Mumbai, retail competitor Rinfra was dependent upon its retail rival TPCD for its electricity supply. This created a price squeeze situation. Judiciary and regulatory interventions were inadequate in addressing price squeeze. Competition continues to be limited to a struggle for customers between privately owned and publicly-owned DLs in Mumbai. The arena for competition should be expanded, as the wireless telecommunications industry illustrates, to offer benefits to consumers not obtainable from regulation alone. Studies have shown that the only successful regulation of electric utilities has been to introduce competition and competitive interaction that eliminates the need for regulation. In mature electricity markets, distribution utilities exposed to true competition have lowered prices and gained sales. More crucially, their finances have met the regulatory test of attracting capital for expansion. In a number of cases, rates of return have risen and exceeded those of comparable companies not under competition. The key lesson from the Mumbai muddle is for legislators, regulators, and courts to recognize that regulation is not a substitute for competition, but rather is an adjunct to competition.

According to Union Ministry of Power, peak power demand in India is likely to cross 400 GW (gigawatt) by 2030 and more generation capacity is being set up to meet the rising demand. Electricity is the most important infrastructure which is a sine qua non for development, it said. One major distinguishing feature between a developing and a developed country is that in a developed country, there is no load shedding. It said that the nation will add enough capacity to meet this burgeoning demand.

The national capital's peak power demand recorded an all-time high winter power demand, reaching 5,816 megawatt (MW) - the highest ever for the winter months, surpassing the previous record of 5,798 MW set on 19 January. Remarkably, this is the sixth instance in January when Delhi's power demand exceeded last year's peak winter demand of 5,526 MW, recorded on 6 January 2023. Barring 2 January, the city's peak demand has consistently surpassed 5,000 MW every day this month so far. The surge in power demand comes on the back of a cold wave across northern India. In the areas served by BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL), peak demand reached 2,526 MW and 1,209 MW, respectively. As per the Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, it met its highest winter peak power demand of 1,826 MW.

The 4,000 MW power project -- Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (PVUNL) -- a joint venture of the NTPC Ltd and the Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) formed after scrapping the old Patratu Thermal Power Station (PTPS) will bring a revolutionary change in the power sector of Jharkhand, making it self-sufficient in terms of power requirement. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the NTPC and the JBVNL, 85 percent of the power produced from PVUNL will be supplied to Jharkhand. The mega power plant conceived in 2016 will comprise five units of 800 MW each and will be commissioned in two phases -- 2,400 MWs (3x800 MW) in the first phase and 1,600 MWs (2x800) in the second phase.

Discom Reform

A roadmap to eliminating power cuts, which has eluded the Noida city (Uttar Pradesh) for decades even as it has grown manifold - both in terms of economy and population - is finally taking shape. The Noida Authority has allocated INR2 billion (bn) (US$24.1 million (mn)) for a pilot project to move power transmission lines under the ground in three sectors -- 3, 15A and 47. Apart from these sectors, the Authority will shift 11 kV (kilovolt) and 33 kV lines underground in some other areas of the city where roads are undergoing a revamp. Occurring almost daily, power cuts have stood out as a sore point in Noida's concerted push to promote the NCR city as a business destination.

Polaris Smart Metering has secured two smart meter projects totalling INR52 bn (US$627.4 mn) in Uttar Pradesh. Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL) has awarded the contracts for installing over 5.1 million smart meters in the important clusters of Lucknow and Ayodhya/Devipatan, which the company plans to install over the next 27 months. As per the agreement, Polaris Smart Metering will supply, commission, install and maintain smart meters for consumers and system metering across the consumer base in these clusters for the next 10 years.

Electric equipment maker HPL Electric and Power has bagged an order worth INR2.4 bn (29 mn) for smart meters from Advanced Metering Infrastructure Service Provider (AMISP). This accomplishment adds to HPL's already existing significant order pipeline, reinforcing its ongoing upward momentum in the dynamic smart meter sector, the company said.

Generation

Prime Minister (PM) of India dedicated two power projects by NTPC and laid the foundation stone of another with a total investment of INR289.78 bn (US$3.5 bn) in Odisha on 3 February. Located in Sundergarh district, the Darlipali STPP is a pit-head power station with supercritical (highly efficient) technology and will supply low-cost power to its beneficiary states such as Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Sikkim. The 250 MW project of NTPC-SAIL Power Company Ltd was established in Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) to provide reliable power for the steel plant, which is vital for economic growth. NTPC is developing the Talcher Thermal Power Project, Stage-III, within the old TTPS plant premises in Angul district, was taken over by NTPC from Odisha State Electricity Board in 1995.

Regulation and Governance

According to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre is moving towards making the electricity bill of the households in the country zero. PM's remarks came while addressing a gathering after inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of projects worth INR115.99 bn (US$1.4 bn) in Guwahati.

The Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, a Rajasthan government-owned power discom (distribution company), vehemently opposed in the Supreme Court (SC) a plea of Adani Power seeking over INR13 bn (US$156.9 mn) as late payment surcharge (LPS) from the state discom. A bench comprising Justices Aniruddha Bose and PV Sanjay Kumar reserved its order on Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd (APRL)'s petition pertaining to its demand for late payment surcharge after hearing heated arguments by senior lawyers Abhishek Singhvi and Dushyant Dave.

According to Union Ministry of Power, the Union government is looking to set March 2025 as the deadline for 24x7 electricity supply across the country. After connecting all households with electricity supply through two flagship schemes in the past decade, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government now plans to ensure uninterrupted reliable power supply by the end of 2024-25 (FY25).

North & South America

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), United States (US) power consumption will rise to record highs in 2024 and 2025. EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,112 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2024 and 4,123 billion kWh in 2025. That compares with 3,994 billion kWh in 2023 and a record 4,070 billion kWh in 2022. As homes and businesses use more electricity instead of fossil fuels for heat and transportation, EIA forecast 2024 power sales would rise to 1,530 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,396 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,035 billion kWh for industrial customers. That compares with all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,391 billion kWh in 2022 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

According to the US EIA, wholesale electricity prices for 2024 in most areas of the US are seen to be close to or slightly lower than in 2023, because of relatively stable generation fuel costs. Periods of high demand or power market supply constraints, however, could lead to temporary spikes in wholesale prices, it said. EIA forecasts US wholesale prices to range between US$30 per megawatt hour (MWh) and US$40 per MWh outside of the Northeast, where the agency expects prices to increase and average US$48/MWh in New York and US$60/MWh in New England. The main source of electricity in the US is natural gas-fired generation, with EIA expecting natural gas prices for the production of electricity to average US$2.91 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2024 compared with US$3.29 per mmBtu in 2023. In most areas, average wholesale electricity costs should remain lower than or comparable to those of the previous year due to lower natural gas prices, the report said. US wholesale power prices are typically calculated on an hourly or daily basis and are designed to reflect market conditions at a specific time.

A winter storm bringing snow, ice and high winds to parts of the US Midwest and Pacific Northwest knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, with a brutal freeze expected to grip numerous states. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said storms continue to cause flight cancellations and delays. Some 150,000 homes and businesses were without power in Michigan. Power was out for another 200,000-plus customers in Oregon and Wisconsin.

The Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) lifted the grid alert issued earlier in the day asking customers to reduce their consumption to avoid a power shortfall after a demand spike caused by extreme cold. The AESO earlier declared the grid alert and asked citizens to immediately reduce their electricity use to essential needs in response to ongoing extreme cold temperatures across western Canada, restricted imports and very high demand. The AESO had projected a shortfall of up to 200 megawatt (MW) of electricity during the peak evening hours and warned of potential rotating outages until demand declined or generation returned to the grid. The AESO said after the alert was issued, it almost immediately saw a 100 MW drop in electricity demand which rose to 200 MW within minutes.

Europe & Russia

Norwegian natural gas exports were curtailed due to an unplanned outage at the Nyhamna processing plant following a power cut at the weekend amid high winds, operator Shell, opens new tab said. The power line which tripped and caused the outage at Nyhamna was repaired late, transmission grid operator Statnett said.

Ukraine reported a surplus of electricity production and intends to export it to neighbouring Moldova and Poland, Ukrainian energy ministry said. Ukraine had produced more energy than it consumed before the Russian invasion in 2022, but that output has dropped since the Russian attacks on power facilities and the occupation of Europe's largest Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said that Ukraine could resume substantial energy exports as early as this spring due to lower consumption. Ukraine banned exports during the last heating season amid Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system and large-scale shutdowns.

Major German power utility EnBW, opens new tab, a likely bidder in auctions for building initially gas-fired generation capacity under a new government scheme, could draw on its existing plant sites, its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andreas Schell said. The company, alongside sector peers Uniper and RWE, opens new tab, is tipped to be among those responding to the long-awaited roadmap laying out details of a possibly €40 billion (US$43.6 billion) plan to avoid power shortages caused by volatile renewable generation, once coal is abandoned. The plan entails state-support for perhaps 20-25 GW of electricity-producing capacity by 2035, which will either be new stations or old ones that are converted, and which are made ready for clean hydrogen operations in the long term. Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said a much-anticipated roadmap for how a new generation of gas-fired power plants would be put out to tender was imminent, fuelling hopes of financial support for the construction of these stations. The plan, with an estimated cost of up to €40 bn (US$43.5 bn), aims to ensure enough electricity generation until renewable energy can overcome storage issues and inadequate grid technology to fully replace fossil fuels. German stakeholders were set to agree a deal on the power plant expansion strategy, which has drawn criticism from environmental campaigners keen to phase out coal and gas as soon as possible.

Sweden's power demand could rise some 150 percent by 2045, transmission grid operator Svenska kraftnat said, driven by plans for new industrial developments and the conversion of fossil fuel-based industries to non-polluting energy sources. Overall demand could rise from 138 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to just over 340 TWh in 2045 under two of the four scenarios the TSO presented in its latest long-term market analysis. The scenarios were deemed the most likely as they closely align with government projections of 300 TWh demand in 2045. To meet the higher demand, Sweden would need to add on average 7.5 TWh of new power generation per year over the next 20 years.

12 February: India's demand for petroleum products is likely to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the financial year ending March 2024, following a 10 percent post-pandemic recovery in 2022-23, according to Fitch Ratings. Both petrol and diesel sales recorded robust 4-6 percent increases in the first nine months of 2023-24, fuelled by heightened economic activities in the agriculture and power sectors, coupled with a surge in holiday travel and auto sales. Fitch said it expects Indian refiners' gross refining margins (GRM) to moderate during 2024-25 from the strong levels expected in 2023-24, but remain above mid-cycle levels. By 2025-26, it foresees a shift closer to mid-cycle levels, but remaining resilient, bolstered by the escalating demand for end-products. In the upstream segment, domestic oil and gas production has modestly increased, driven by a 5 percent rise in gas production in the first nine months of 2023-24. Fitch forecasts the oil and gas sector's high capex intensity to continue in the medium term, particularly with upstream companies investing in production enhancement.

8 February: India wants to sign a multi-year oil purchase deal with Guyana and acquire stakes in the South American nation's exploration areas, the Guyanese minister for natural resources Vickram Bharrat said. He said any such deal with India would have to be approved by Guyana's cabinet. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, wants to diversify its crude sources. India approved the signing of a five-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Guyana earlier this month for cooperation in energy. After a meeting with India's Oil Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, Bharat said Indian companies are interested in picking up stakes in Guyana's exploration acreage through negotiation rather than a bidding process.

8 February: India's fuel consumption rose 8.2 percent year-on-year in January, government data showed, helped by strong industrial activity in the world's third largest oil consumer. Total consumption, a proxy for oil demand, totalled 20.04 million tonnes (MT) in January, up from 18.51 MT a year earlier, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed. Consumption held relatively steady month-on-month from December's seven-month high of 20.05 MT.

8 February: At the India Energy Week 2024 in Goa, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) took a significant step towards enhancing the efficiency of LPG cylinder delivery in India. The company has launched a ground-breaking initiative titled ""Pure for Sure"" that emphasizes quality and quantity assurance for LPG cylinders. The announcement was made by the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, with the aim of improving customer satisfaction. The ""Pure for Sure"" initiative is a first-of-its-kind in the industry, designed to ensure the integrity of the product from the production plant to the customer's doorstep. To do so, BPCL has introduced a tamper-proof seal with QR codes on the cylinders. When these QR codes are scanned, customers receive a pop-up and a signature tune that indicates the cylinder's gross weight at the time of filling, enabling them to verify the cylinder before acceptance. In a progressive move, BPCL plans to include women in the LPG delivery process, acknowledging their understanding of the product. This shift not only promotes gender equality but also adds a unique perspective to the delivery process. With the launch of the ""Pure for Sure"" initiative, BPCL is poised to redefine the standard in LPG cylinder delivery, focusing on reliability, transparency, and excellence in customer service.

7 February: India is expected to be the largest driver of global oil demand growth between 2023 and 2030, narrowly taking the lead from top importer China, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The world's third-largest oil importer and consumer is on track to post an oil demand increase of almost 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) between 2023 and 2030, accounting for more than one-third of the projected 3.2 million bpd of global increases in the period, the IEA said in a report. The agency forecast India's demand would reach 6.6 million bpd in 2030, up from 5.5 million bpd in 2023. The single largest basis of India's oil consumption will be diesel fuel, accounting for almost half of the rise in the nation's demand and more than one-sixth of total global oil demand growth through to 2030, the IEA said. Jet fuel is poised to grow 5.9 percent annually on average but this will be from a low base compared with other countries, it said. To meet this demand, India is expected to add 1 million bpd of new refining capacity over the seven-year period and this will increase its crude imports further to 5.8 million bpd by 2030, the IEA said.

7 February: Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd (ISPRL) has signed a deal with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) to lease 300,000 metric tonnes of storage space for three years in a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in Vizag in southern India. ISPRL operates three SPRs in southern India with combined capacity of about 5 million tonnes (MT). ISPRL said the contract with HPCL is for two years with a provision to extend it by one year. The 1.03 MT SPR at Vizag is half filled with Iraqi oil. And after leasing of space to HPCL, there is scope to rent out the remainder 200,000 tonnes space. ISPRL will soon invite bids to lease out half of the 1.5 MT SPR in Mangalore, where one of the two equally sized compartments has been leased to UAE's ADNOC. ISPRL has been selling from the caverns to local refiners after a change in the government rules in 2021.

13 February: Clean fuel supply in Kolkata is set to receive a significant boost in the coming months with the completion of the main trunk GAIL gas transportation pipeline. Bengal Gas Company Ltd CEO (chief executive officer) Anupam Mukhopadhyay stated that the GAIL gas pipeline would be completed within the next three months, with the resolution of an 800-meter hurdle and the necessary statutory clearances.

8 February: India's Petronet LNG plans to begin supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to neighbouring Sri Lanka for five years starting in 2025, its chief executive officer (CEO) Akshay Kumar Singh said. Petronet will ship 850 metric tonnes of gas daily to the island nation in 50 containers of 17 tonnes each, he said. The project will supply two gas-fired power plants in Sri Lanka, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages. Petronet plans to commission a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) in Sri Lanka and hopes to gain government approval by 2025 to build the facility by 2028. He said that Petronet, India's top gas importer, is looking for more long-term gas deals. The company signed a deal for QatarEnergy to supply it with 7.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from 2028 to 2048, extending an existing agreement.

13 February: India's coal import registered a rise of 27.2 percent to 23.35 million tonnes (MT) in December, over the corresponding month of the previous fiscal. The coal ministry is aiming for zero thermal coal import by FY26. The country's coal import was 18.35 MT in the corresponding month of the previous fiscal, according to data compiled by mjunction services ltd. Of the total imports in December, non-coking coal imports stood at 15.47 MT, against 10.61 MT imported in December 2022. Coking coal import volume was 4.84 MT, against 4.71 MT imported in the same month of the previous financial year. The coal import in the April-December period of the current fiscal increased to 192.43 MT, over 191.82 MT in the year-ago period. During the April-December period of the current fiscal, non-coking coal import was at 124.37 MT, marginally lower than 126.89 MT imported during the same period in the previous financial year. Coking coal import was at 42.81 MT during April-December 2023-24, slightly up against 41.35 MT recorded for April-December 2022-23.

7 February: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister (CM) Vishnu Deo Sai announced in the Assembly scrapping of an order issued during the previous Congress government regarding the issuance of permits for coal transportation in the state through offline mode. The move will restore the old system of coal transportation by seeking transport permits online.

11 February: No subsidised power will be provided to any minister, officer or government employee in Assam, Chief Minister (CM) Himanta Biswa Sarma said. He has instructed the power department to install prepaid meters in government quarters, including residences in the ministerial colony. Sarma that he was informed by power department officials during a recent interaction that a very nominal amount on account of the monthly power bill is deducted from the salaries of ministers and senior officers.

7 February: The Jharkhand government decided to increase the limit of free electricity to 125 units from the existing 100 units per month for domestic consumers. In a review meeting with senior officials including the chief secretary, Chief Minister (CM) Champai Soren directed the energy department to prepare a proposal in this regard. The state government started the '100-unit free electricity' scheme in 2022 with an aim to reduce financial burden of the people. The scheme is applicable up to the consumption of 100 units of electricity per month for domestic connections.

11 February: Chhattisgarh has inaugurated the country's biggest solar energy plant with a battery energy storage system located near the Dhaba village in the Rajnandgaon district. This solar facility established by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Chhattisgarh Power Distribution Company provides a capacity of 100 megawatt (MW). This solar plant ensures that there will be electricity even during the night generating over five lakh units per day. This will reduce 4.5 lakh metric tons of carbon emission and boost green energy. The on-grid solar power plant set-up by the Chhattisgarh Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA) is a significant step towards sustainable energy. The plant was established on 1 February 2024. The plant features a 100 MW solar plant equipped with 2,39,000 bifacial solar panels which is producing electricity from both the sides. The plant is expected to generate power for the next seven years using solar energy. The decision to establish the first solar park in the Bairam hill area of the Rajnandgaon district was taken by the Chhattisgarh government to maximize the use of these hilly terrains for solar power.

8 February: To propel the adoption of solar energy, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has unveiled plans to transform 17 major cities of the state into solar cities including revered cities of Ayodhya and Varanasi. Under the initiative, the development of solar cities will take place first and then the government will work towards building solar villages on the same pattern. Notably, the administration has already started its efforts to establish Ayodhya as the inaugural solar city. Recently, state's Energy Minister A K Sharma underscored UP's commitment to solar energy advancement and revealed that the state is poised to emerge as a leader in the solar energy domain, with initiatives already gaining momentum. Ayodhya's solar city project encompasses the installation of over 2,500 solar-powered streetlights, enhancing the sacred city's commitment to sustainability. CM (Chief Minister) Yogi Adityanath started a solar boat service in Ayodhya. The city already boasts solar-powered amenities such as ATMs and solar trees adorning its 40 intersections, epitomising the city's embrace of renewable energy solutions. With Ayodhya spearheading the solar energy adoption, another major city Varanasi is making a foothold to install rooftop solar plants across government buildings. Under the project, Varanasi is slated to witness the installation of 25,000 rooftop solar plants, positioning it as a beacon of solar innovation.

7 February: SJVN Ltd said it has received a letter of intent (LoI) from Gujarat Urja Vias Nigam Ltd to set up a 200 megawatt (MW) solar power project. The tentative cost of construction and development of this project is INR11 billion, SJVN chairman and managing director (CMD) Geeta Kapur said. The ground-mounted solar project shall be developed by SJVN subsidiary SJVN Green Energy Ltd (SGEL) anywhere in India through an EPC contract. The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) shall be executed with GUVNL after the adoption of the tariff by GERC (Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission), it said. The project is expected to generate 508.4 million units in the first year after commissioning and the projected cumulative energy generation over a period of 25 years is 11,836.28 million units.

13 February: OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) stuck to its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2024 and 2025 and raised its economic growth forecasts for both years saying there was further upside potential. The OPEC said world oil demand will rise by 2.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 and by 1.85 million bpd in 2025. A further boost to economic growth could give additional tailwind to oil demand. OPEC's 2024 demand growth forecast is already higher than that of other forecasters such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), although the wider OPEC+ alliance is still cutting output to support the market. For this year, OPEC's expectation of oil demand growth is much more than the expansion of 1.24 million bpd so far forecast by the IEA. The IEA, which represents industrialised countries, is scheduled to update its forecasts. OPEC and the IEA have clashed in recent years over issues such as long-term demand and the need for investment in new supply. The IEA sees oil demand peaking by 2030 as the world shifts to cleaner energy, a view OPEC dismisses.

12 February: United States (US) oil output from top shale-producing regions will rise in March to its highest in four months, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Production from the top basins will rise by nearly 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.7 million bpd, its highest since December, the EIA said. Oil output in the Permian basin, the largest US shale field spread across West Texas and New Mexico, was due to rise by about 14,000 bpd to 6.1 million bpd, the second highest monthly output on record after November, the EIA said. Production in the Eagle Ford in southeast Texas was due to rise nearly 4,700 bpd to 1.1 million bpd, the highest since September, the EIA said. In the Bakken, output was set to rise by about 3,000 bpd to 1.2 million bpd, the highest since December.

12 February: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Middle East economies were lagging below growth projections due to oil production cuts and the Israel-Gaza conflict, even as the global economic outlook remained resilient. In a regional economic report last month, the IMF revised its GDP growth forecast for the Middle East and North Africa down to 2.9 percent this year, lagging below October projections, due in part to short term oil production cuts and the conflict in Gaza.

8 February: French energy giant TotalEnergies is seeking to sell its minority share in a major Nigerian onshore oil joint venture, following Shell's divestment, CEO (chief executive officer) Patrick Pouyanne said. The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), in which TotalEnergies holds a 10 percent stake, has struggled with hundreds of onshore oil spills as a result of theft, sabotage and operational issues that led to costly repairs and high-profile lawsuits over the years. TotalEnergies is the latest international oil company seeking to withdraw from Nigeria's onshore sector after decades of operations. But the French group, which produced a total of 219,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023 in Nigeria, remains a major operator of offshore fields in the West African country. It announced the start-up of the Akpo West oilfield located 135 kilometres off the coast.

12 February: Faced with stubbornly high Russian gas imports as the war in Ukraine rages on, Austria is seeking to take more radical steps, including ending energy company OMV's long-term contract to buy gas from Gazprom, Austria's Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler said. Having long sought to maintain close ties with nearby Russia, Austria sought to end its decades-long dependency on affordable Russian gas soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, scrambling to find alternative providers. Gewessler said the Russian share of Austria's gas imports actually increased in December to a new record of 98 percent from 76 percent the month before, even if the total volume of imports fell slightly.

9 February: The Russian government has extended a permit for its Yamal LNG plant to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to German nationalised gas importer and trader SEFE until 31 December 2040. Russia banned trade with a number of companies including Gazprom Germania in 2022, but a year later the government made a special dispensation for the company to allow the LNG sales until the end of 2024. The decision to extend the permission was published as Russia's largest liquefied natural gas producer Novatek is facing sanctions and delays at its new Arctic LNG 2 project.

8 February: Germany will receive its first supplies of pipeline natural gas from Algeria under a medium-term contract signed between a subsidiary of trader VNG AG and oil and gas firm Sonatrach, the companies said. This makes VNG the first German company to purchase pipeline gas from Algeria. Germany has been forced to seek new suppliers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 ended Germany's decades of reliance on Russian gas. Algeria's gas production at 106 billion cubic meters per year, according to Sonatrach.

7 February: British energy supplier Centrica has agreed to purchase 1 million metric tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Spain's Repsol between 2025 and 2027, Centrica said. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent in the South of England.

13 February: Asia's imports of seaborne thermal coal eased from record highs in January as top buyers China and India saw arrivals ease. However, there was strength in Japan and South Korea, which helped drive some divergence in prices between the high-energy coal preferred by the third- and fourth-biggest importers in Asia, and the lower quality fuel sought by China and India. Asia seaborne imports of thermal coal, used mainly to generate electricity, dropped to 77.65 million metric tonnes in January, according to commodity analysts Kpler data. China's January imports of seaborne thermal coal slipped to 27.92 million tons from December's all-time peak of 31.59 million, but were still 34 percent above the 20.86 million from January 2023. China's appetite for imported coal has been fuelled by strong demand for thermal generation amid lower output from hydropower, as well as by a price advantage compared to domestic coal prices. The main grades imported by China are lower-energy coal from Indonesia and mid-rank fuel from Australia.

13 February: United States (US) energy regulators have launched a review of the performance of the bulk power system during recent winter storms in January that brought Arctic air across much of North America, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said. Elliott was the name given to the system that brought frigid cold and blowing winds, knocking out power for more than 1.5 million homes and businesses across the US in December 2022. In November 2023, the US energy regulators urged lawmakers to fill a regulatory blind spot to maintain reliable supply of natural gas during extreme cold weather that was highlighted by an inquiry into power outages during Elliott.

8 February: German gas-fired electricity generation jumped to its highest levels in two years in January as power firms dialled up output to compensate for the closure of the country's nuclear reactors and meet higher heating demand during a cold snap last month. The 8.74 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity generated from gas-fired power stations was the highest since January 2022, according to think tank Ember, which was just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to the severing of gas pipeline flows to Europe's largest gas consumer and economy. Gas-powered generation was 13 percent above January 2023 levels, and helped lift Germany's total electricity generation to its highest level in a year. Higher gas generation also lifted natural gas' share of Germany's electricity generation mix to 18.6 percent, the highest since early 2021, which indicates that German power firms remain reliant on fossil fuels for electricity production despite ongoing energy transition efforts. While German power producers lifted generation from gas power plants in January, use of coal-fired generation remains below previous levels. Coal-fired electricity production in January was 10.83 TWh, which was down 29 percent from January 2023 and around 22 percent below the average coal generation levels of 2022.

8 February: China's National Development and Reform Council (NDRC) is moving to refine the pricing mechanisms for services essential to stabilising power supply in markets increasingly dependent on wind and solar power, in a fresh step toward creating a national electricity market by 2030. NDRC said it would focus on optimising pricing mechanisms for standby capacity, frequency modulation and so called peak shaving - which are ancillary services essential to maintaining reliable electricity supply. The peak shaving market allows power companies to buy power from quick-ramping sources such as energy storage and flexible coal plants, to help them meet spikes in demand. Frequency regulation helps maintain normal frequency on the grid, a function that can be performed by battery storage systems and generators such as coal- and gas-fired plants. The ancillary services rule is among a series of basic documents setting out the rules for a national electricity market by 2025, with the market's start targeted for 2030.

9 February: European Union (EU) countries voted to pass a law to reduce emissions from trucks, after late demands by Germany had threatened to sink the policy. The move is the latest in a string of last-minute upsets to European Union (EU) laws, caused by disputes within Germany's three-way coalition government. The law, which will enforce a 90 percent cut in CO (carbon dioxide) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles by 2040, still needs approval from the EU Parliament to enter into force. To win Germany's backing, EU countries agreed to add a preamble to the law which said the European Commission would consider developing rules to register trucks running on COneutral fuels, which could count towards the targets, diplomats said.

8 February: Britain's biggest bank HSBC has partnered with Google to finance fast-growing climate technology firms behind some of the world's most promising solutions to global climate change. Under terms of the partnership, HSBC will look to provide financing to companies cherry-picked by the US technology giant to join its Google Cloud Ready-Sustainability programme. Scaling technologies that can help the corporate world move more quickly to a low-carbon economy dominated the COP28 climate talks in Dubai in December, and is a crucial part of most banks' efforts to drive a global push to cut emissions.

8 February: Australia experienced its eighth-warmest year in 2023, with the influence of climate change pushing average temperatures almost 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1961-1990 average, the weather bureau said. Last year's extreme weather swings took Australia from widespread flooding and the coolest January since 2002 through the hottest southern hemisphere winter and early spring and driest three months on record to end with heavy rainfall as summer got underway. Forecasters warn that climate change will make Australia hotter and increase the severity of weather extremes. The bureau said that globally 2023 was the warmest year on record, with ocean temperatures at their highest ever since April and the extent of Antarctic sea ice at a record low for much of the year. For most of 2023, Australia was in the grip of an El Nino weather phenomenon - a warming of the Pacific Ocean waters along the equator off the coast of South America that typically causes hot, dry weather in Australia and Southeast Asia.

May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,9,,eng-9563546

The hydrogen gas comes from OKG's hydrogen plant, which was established as early as 1992 to be used to cool generators at units 1-3 of Sweden's Oskarshamn NPP to reduce the risk of stress corrosion cracking of the reactor piping by reducing the amount of free oxygen in the coolant.

However, Oskarshamn 1&2 were permanently closed in 2016 and 2017 resulting in hydrogen overcapacity. OKG has modernised the hydrogen plant to expand operations and signed its first contract to supply hydrogen from the plant to industrial gases company Linde in 2022.

""Great that the surplus production we sell can help Hynion with hydrogen for their hydrogen gas stations so that together we can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions,"" said OKG CEO Johan Lundberg. All operations in Uniper's portfolio have two main tasks: ensuring a secure energy supply and driving the energy conversion. ""Uniper plays an important role in establishing Europe's hydrogen economy and the development of a significant renewable energy business,"" Lundberg noted.

Hynion CEO Slavica Djuric said: ""We are very grateful for this cooperation. We need stable producers who, together with us at Hynion, want to contribute to the energy conversion and a fossil-free future."" He added: ""Hydrogen delivery from OKG is an important step in ensuring the availability of fossil-free fuel at our stations.""

Hynion builds, owns and operates hydrogen gas stations in and around major cities in Scandinavia. The company's management also has long experience of establishing and running start-ups in hydrogen technology and renewable energy. Hynion said the partnership represents an important part of its strategy to reduce dependence on individual suppliers as it prepares for increasing hydrogen-powered traffic in Sweden.",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.4352941176470588,453481090,9,,eng-9561767

Full transcript - Veolia Environnement (EPA: VIE ) VE (OTC: VEOEY ) Q1 2024:

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year. And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know. EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know. I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter. As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price. How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy. As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia. Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation. Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates. Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few. The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry. The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments. Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell. This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027. I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins. In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion. In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan. On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed. District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect. As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia. On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan. In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe. Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027. On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants. And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2. On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million. I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada. In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez. Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak. The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi. All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents. In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year. We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1. And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group. These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts. 85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years. We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular. We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed. Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably. To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants. The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now. And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia. So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce. On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS. I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle: Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses. Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA. Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level. Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts. On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge. Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin. For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe. Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S. In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes. Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi. North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%. In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations. Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation. Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1. I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group. And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed. In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation. Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung (KS: 005930 ) contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases. The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech. I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America. To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability. We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year. In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized. Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%. On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent. On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong. I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule. In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America. Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe. EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable. Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023. Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany. The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year. Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's (NYSE: MCO ) with a stable outlook. Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains. More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).

Arthur Sitbon: So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year. And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question. The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that. So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can. And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks. As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can. And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit. In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year. I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada. So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies. In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important. In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well. Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much. And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities. And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%. So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).

Ajay Patel: Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution? And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down. And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Claude Laruelle: Total usage.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel: Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why. PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same. So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those. But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate. So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS. How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that. High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business. So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned. So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution. And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again. So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of. We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick. On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel: I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff: I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Ajay Patel: Water volume. I'm sorry.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one. Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers. So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically. A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay. So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank (ETR: DBKGn ).

Olly Jeffery: So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there. And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please? And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

Claude Laruelle: On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity. And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China. In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization. On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024. So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff: And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce. And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition. How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place. So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery: That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping: I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water. And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great. And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive. I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable. So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold. And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years. Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S. As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle: So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech. And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen? I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).

Alexandre Roncier: I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter? And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business. So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation. In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm. In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime. So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026. And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez: I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat? And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question. And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle: So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital. And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan. But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect. And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth. In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative. So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things. So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez: I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit. So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus. Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards. Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution. And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times. And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle: Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff: That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle. It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one. And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters. So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies. So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range. When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027. I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on. And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Operator: Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year. And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know. EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know. I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter. As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price. How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy. As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia. Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation. Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates. Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few. The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry. The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments. Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell. This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027. I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins. In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion. In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan. On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed. District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect. As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia. On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan. In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe. Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027. On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants. And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2. On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million. I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada. In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez. Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak. The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi. All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents. In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year. We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1. And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group. These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts. 85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years. We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular. We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed. Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably. To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants. The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now. And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia. So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce. On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS. I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle: Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses. Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA. Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level. Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts. On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge. Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin. For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe. Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S. In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes. Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi. North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%. In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations. Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation. Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1. I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group. And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed. In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation. Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung (KS:005930) contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases. The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech. I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America. To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability. We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year. In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized. Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%. On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent. On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong. I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule. In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America. Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe. EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable. Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023. Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany. The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year. Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) with a stable outlook. Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains. More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley.

Arthur Sitbon: So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year. And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question. The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that. So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can. And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks. As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can. And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit. In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year. I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada. So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies. In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important. In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well. Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much. And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities. And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%. So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs.

Ajay Patel: Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution? And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down. And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Claude Laruelle: Total usage.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel: Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why. PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same. So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those. But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate. So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS. How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that. High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business. So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned. So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution. And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again. So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of. We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick. On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel: I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff: I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Ajay Patel: Water volume. I'm sorry.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one. Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers. So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically. A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay. So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank.

Olly Jeffery: So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there. And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please? And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

Claude Laruelle: On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity. And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China. In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization. On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024. So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff: And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce. And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition. How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place. So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery: That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping: I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water. And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great. And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive. I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable. So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold. And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years. Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S. As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle: So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech. And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen? I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America.

Alexandre Roncier: I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter? And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business. So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation. In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm. In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime. So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026. And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez: I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat? And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question. And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle: So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital. And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan. But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect. And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth. In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative. So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things. So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez: I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit. So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus. Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards. Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution. And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times. And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle: Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff: That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle. It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one. And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters. So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies. So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range. When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027. I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on. And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Operator: Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer.

Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year.

And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know.

EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know.

I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively.

Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter.

As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price.

How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy.

As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia.

Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation.

Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates.

Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few.

The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry.

The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments.

Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell.

This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027.

I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins.

In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion.

In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan.

On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed.

District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect.

As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia.

On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan.

In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe.

Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027.

On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants.

And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2.

On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million.

I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada.

In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez.

Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak.

The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi.

All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents.

In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year.

We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1.

And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group.

These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts.

85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years.

We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular.

We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed.

Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably.

To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants.

The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now.

And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia.

So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce.

On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS.

I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle

Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses.

Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA.

Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level.

Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts.

On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge.

Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin.

For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe.

Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S.

In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes.

Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi.

North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%.

In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations.

Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation.

Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1.

I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group.

And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed.

In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation.

Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases.

The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech.

I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America.

To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability.

We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year.

In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized.

Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%.

On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent.

On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong.

I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule.

In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America.

Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe.

EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable.

Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023.

Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany.

The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year.

Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's with a stable outlook.

Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains.

More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley.

Arthur Sitbon

So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year.

And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question.

The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that.

So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can.

And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks.

As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can.

And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit.

In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year.

I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada.

So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies.

In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important.

In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well.

Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much.

And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities.

And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%.

So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs.

Ajay Patel

Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution?

And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down.

And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel

Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why.

PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same.

So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those.

But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate.

So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS.

How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that.

High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business.

So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned.

So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution.

And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again.

So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of.

We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick.

On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel

I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff

I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one.

Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers.

So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically.

A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay.

So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank.

Olly Jeffery

So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there.

And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please?

And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff

Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity.

And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China.

In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization.

On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024.

So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff

And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce.

And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition.

How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place.

So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery

That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping

I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water.

And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great.

And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive.

I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable.

So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold.

And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years.

Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S.

As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle

So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech.

And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen?

I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America.

Alexandre Roncier

I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter?

And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business.

So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation.

In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm.

In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime.

So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026.

And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez

I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat?

And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question.

And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle

So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital.

And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff

Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan.

But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect.

And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth.

In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative.

So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things.

So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez

I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit.

So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus.

Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards.

Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution.

And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times.

And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle

Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff

That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian

Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle.

It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one.

And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters.

So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies.

So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range.

When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian

Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027.

I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on.

And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Hydrogen associations from central Europe have told pv magazine that their hydrogen import projects are proceeding at full speed. In contrast, the green hydrogen production projects in the central part of the continent are lagging behind in terms of development, primarily because of high electricity costs. Some analysts also noted issues with regulation and hydrogen demand in Europe.

Two sources, who asked to remain unnamed, said that some parts of Europe are better at dealing with production projects - namely, the Nordics and the Iberian Peninsula. As an example, they noted the results of the European Hydrogen Bank's first auction, whose winners were projects in Finland, Norway, Spain and Portugal. Scandinavia and Iberia are indeed the two European regions with the lowest electricity prices.

""Norway has been a leader of CCS technology for over 30 years. Hydrogen is a tool in our toolbox for the energy transition,"" said Hilde Gillebo, senior adviser for Norway's Ministry of Energy, adding that many Norwegian companies are active in the field, covering both blue and green hydrogen.

Henrik Andersen, Equinor's director hydrogen NWE, said that blue hydrogen is essential to scale up the market.

""We have to embrace blue hydrogen now. We will then gradually switch to green hydrogen,"" said Bjørgulf Haukelidsæter Eidesen, CO-CEO for Horisont Energi, rejecting doubts about blue hydrogen's environmental sustainability.

The uncertainties resulting from the business case of Europe are pushing technology companies, from electrolysis developers to process engineering specialists, to team up. This way, they can drive costs down, increase efficiency, and diversify risks. This approach is particularly relevant to kick off innovative projects, but also to scale up the production of existing technologies, while creating demand for products.

""Relationships are essential,"" said Lorenzo Fernández de Villavicencio, strategy manager at Linde, during a joint presentation with Keshni Srirathan, senior associate at OCI Global.

In February 2023, OCI selected Linde to supply clean hydrogen and nitrogen to OCI's new blue ammonia facility under development in Texas. The project is expected to start production in 2025.

German energy company Uniper, meanwhile, said that Europe needs to expand its storage facilities. In April 2024, Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) wrote that there is an ""urgent need for targeted policy intervention to fulfill European underground hydrogen storage requirements.""

These were the main messages on the first day of the ongoing hydrogen conference in Rotterdam, where hydrogen exporting countries are participating in great numbers. Canada and Australia are the two countries with the two largest stands and the most robust representation on the stages.

""Europe has a vibrant and advanced hydrogen economy, and we've seen here at the World Hydrogen Summit 2024 increasing momentum from both offtakers and developers,"" Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson told pv magazine. ""The EU has done a lot to create goof regulation and bridge the cost gap, now what we need is for member states to translate that to country level regulations as well.""

Japan is also in the mix, with several companies speaking about how they transported hydrogen - either liquefied or through hydrogen carriers like methylcyclohexane (MCH).

In addition, several engineering and technical companies were present on the first day, mostly from Germany. There were few solar companies, but big oil and gas companies were well represented, from bp to Shell to Equinor.",pv-magazine.com,news,pv magazine International,Sergio Matalucci,0.08235294117647052,453384873,1,https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_2083-280x280.jpg,eng-9561767

Dear ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Uniper Analyst and Investor Conference Call First Quarter Results 2024. At our customers' request, this conference will be recorded. As a reminder all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]

I will now hand over to Stefan Jost to start the meeting. Please go ahead.

Stefan Jost

Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to welcome you to our first quarter results of fiscal year 2024. So we are here in our regular setup. And next to me on today's call is Jutta Donges, our Chief Financial Officer. Jutta will lead you through the presentation today. And as usual there will be a Q&A session at the end.

Thank you, Stefan. And good morning, everyone. A warm welcome also from myself. Let's kick it off with the highlights and major achievements in the first quarter. We have successfully started the fiscal year 2024. In the first three months, Uniper's new KPI as of January this year, the group adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR885 million following on an exceptionally strong first quarter in the prior year.

The development was mainly driven by declining achieved gas and power prices in less volatile markets. The bottom-line came out even stronger. The group's adjusted net income has risen to EUR570 million. The performance is fully in-line with our expectations, and today we confirm our outlook for the full year for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income.

Before I'll provide more details on our figures during the presentation, let me highlight some remarkable achievements during the first quarter which underpin our financial stabilization. I am pleased to emphasize that we recently achieved a meaningful milestone in our financing leeway. We have refinanced and extended our syndicated credit facility from 2018 of EUR1.7 billion to EUR3 billion. This is our first credit facility with anchor our sustainability targets, namely our carbon reduction targets and the strategic expansion targets in renewal energy.

The new sustainability linked credit line has a maximum maturity until 2029, including two options to extend for an additional year each. The new RCF gives Uniper financial heading needed to support our operations going forward. At the same time, we were very delighted with the high level of demand and the confidence of our lenders. The order book was well oversubscribed which is a clear signal for Uniper's regained stability.

As a result of our accelerated financial recovery and our exceptional strong performance in 2023, the rating agency S&P Global confirmed in March, our corporate investment-grade rating at BBB-minus with a stable outlook for the third time in a row. Notably, our stand alone rating improved by three notches. Correspondingly S&P revised this assessment of the so-called likelihood of extraordinary government support downward, thereby reducing the government uplift from five to two notches. Ladies and gentlemen, the high rating uplift for our stand-alone credit rating confirmed our efforts and ambition of further strengthening our financials, as well as our business risk profile by derisking our business activities.

A further improvement and higher predictability of our earnings streams are essential steps on the way to become a standalone investment-grade company again. As announced during our presentation for the financial year 2023, we have implemented the new IFRS segment structure to reflect how we see our business going forward, which we report for the first time today. And our strategy is to transform Uniper into a leading provider of green energy in Europe. We have adjusted our segment accordingly. This enhances our steering towards our green transformation.

Pro forma segment, European generation is split into two segments; green generation which contains our existing carbon-free generation and our overtime increasing renewable business. Flexible generation under all generation activities that contribute to ensuring grid stability and security of supply, a key pillar of the energy transition in Uniper's core markets. The former segment Global Commodities has changed into Greener Commodities. As said earlier our aim is also to transform our commodities business over time into a Greener Commodities business, with increasing shares of green gases like hydrogen for our PPA activities.

One example for our role in security of supply and delivering green, bespoke solutions is the recent expansion of a power purchase agreement with our long-standing customer, Deutsche Bank for a further five years. This means we will supply around 88 gigawatt hours per year of green electricity from our Swedish hydropower plant.

Let's now move on to Slide 4, which highlights our strong progress in strengthening our financing base. Before we will dive into our financial numbers, I'd like to take the opportunity to have a closer look at Uniper financing instruments. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I'm proud that we have successfully expanded Uniper's access to financing by our credit markets in recent weeks. In our approach, we were guided by four key financial objectives.

First and foremost we want to ensure that Uniper always has sufficient liquid funds available. This is particularly important to support our operating businesses for the adequate liquidity. On the one hand, we've developed strategies to better manage our margining requirements, and that minimize the potential liquidity risk. And on the other hand, we have credit facilities with a broad range of plans in place to cover collateral for marginal obligations, if appropriate and serve working capital needs.

Secondly and just as importantly, we want to ensure that we have sufficient access to

diverse and flexible financing instruments that will enable Uniper to pursue significant transformation investments in-line with our strategy. Reporting these two goals, Uniper has a new revolving credit facility of EUR3 billion agreed since March replacing the previous one of EUR1.7 billion. The new credit line, serves as a constant liquidity reserves and the flexible financing needs of working capital.

As mentioned before the new credit facility agreement has been signed for the first time as a so-called sustainability-linked credit facility. Financing conditions are partly due to the achievement of carbon reduction and strategic expansion targets in renewable energy. This is a major achievement and a clear sign that the financing market is recognizing Uniper's regained stability and new strategic direction.

In addition, in April, we completed the reestablishment of our EUR2 billion debt issuance program which has listed at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This provides the next fundamental step to regain credit market readiness and was seen as a technical access to the Eurobond market. On top, I'd like to briefly remind you that we have already prolonged our Euro commercial paper program in the amount of EUR1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2023 to have effectively a short-term liquidity. These key financing instruments provide us with considerable financial headroom to support the green transformation of Uniper going forward.

Bear in mind that is due to our very comfortable economic net cash position of EUR4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter 2024. We're not yet making use of any of these credit facilities, with the exception of a base issuance of our commercial paper program to be visible in the market. Back to our financial objectives. The third assumption aspect is the full redemption of the utilization under KfW facility credit facility already in 2023. KfW facility expiry in 2026. After our financial turnaround in the financial year 2023, we are less dependent on the KfW facility, and together with our new RCF, we are confident to further downsize it.

And accordingly, we also have been able to take a major step forward and have reduced the KfW credit line from [$11.5 billion] (ph) to EUR5 billion at the beginning of May. Fourth, our ultimate goal is to achieve a solid stand-alone investment grade rating. As already mentioned, the latest update from S&P has brought us considerably closer to this target. We are working hard to achieve our goal, as quickly as possible also to make Uniper fit for the capital markets again.

Now over to the key financials for the first quarter of 2024 on the next slide. Looking at adjusted EBITDA of EUR885 million for the first quarter of this year the earnings trend is with inside of prior year's record figures, despite substantially lower achieved power and gas prices. I'll explain the result drivers in detail in the next slide.

Operating cash flow doubled year-on-year and stands at EUR1.45 billion. Main driver and the reason for the significant deviation from the operating performance is the absence of effects from liquidity measures during crisis years that had burdened the first quarter of 2023 operating cash flows. Adjusted net income of EUR570 million in the first quarter of 2024 is EUR112 million higher than the already good prior year figure and our operating results. The largest effect comes from a very good economic interest result, in-line with the development of our cash position and driven by lower utilization of financing instruments. And I'll come back to adjusted net income in more detail during my presentation.

The net income of EUR462 million is in part with adjusted net income. The enormous swing with a negative year-on-year effect of almost EUR6.5 billion, was mainly caused by the absence of the release of longer provisions for onerous contracts. To remember the significant provision has to be recognized in 2022 for potential future losses in the gas portfolio following the discontinuation of Russian gas supplies and was reversed at the end of the first quarter of 2023, as a consequence of significantly lower market prices.

As already mentioned following the enormous financial turnaround in 2023, Uniper has achieved an economic net cash position at the end of last year. Thanks to a very good operating cash flow this position was further expanded to more than EUR4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter 2024. On the next slide, I'll dive into the key drivers for adjusted EBITDA. While flexible generation, as in the prior year was the most important earnings driver in the first quarter 2024, in absolute terms this waterfall graph clearly shows that the most positive earnings improvement compared to the prior year resulted from our Gas Midstream business as part of the Greener Commodities segment.

The gas business was able to achieve a significantly more positive contribution in Q1 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, which was extraordinary burden mainly by the liquidity measures taken in fiscal year 2022. In general Gas Midstream delivered improved earnings compared to the previous year, that remained a negative territory. The decline in the Greener Commodities Power Trading business, shows that the trading results has returned to more normalized levels after a particularly positive previous year in which Uniper benefited considerably from a volatile market price environment.

The adjusted EBITDA of the Green Generation segment shows noticeably -- noticeable lower contributions compared to the same period of the previous year. Break it down further, Swedish nuclear energy benefited from price-related higher earnings because of successful hedging transactions. In addition, nuclear energy was able to increase its generation volume in the first quarter of 2024 due to the improved availability of Ringhals 4.

However, these positive effects were more than offset by lower margin contributions with Swedish hydro and German hydro, mainly due to lower prices. Also, the contribution from our pump storage and storage hydro plant had been lower due to less favorable peak day spreads. Nevertheless, the outlook for Green Power is overall positive. As announced in February, we are still convinced that we will achieve a higher result for green generation for the full year 2024 than in the previous year.

The negative data in the first quarter will turn positive towards the end of the financial year, later as the fourth quarter of 2023 was negatively impacted by the recognition of nuclear provisions. Flexible generation. Even though this [block] (ph) is negative on a year-over-year comparison, I would like to emphasize that we have achieved a very good operating result here. Nevertheless the extremely good result of the previous year, in which we achieved record high spreads, has not been imputable as we have indicated in prior phases.

In addition, due to the lower prices compared to the previous year, the production of gas and in particular coal-fired electricity was less profitable and therefore lower. Accordingly, we did not only experience a negative price effect, but also a lower volume effect. In contrast, the impact of the temporary carbon saving effect on the earnings and flexible generation was positive in the first quarter 2024 on the back of lower carbon prices.

For the outlook, it should be taken into account that this positive driver will settle at the end of the year. Slide seven shows the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net income for the first quarter 2024. Main messages are; first we have a positive economic interest result of EUR52 million, which was boosted by our high cash position and lower commitment fees for our credit facilities which also has a positive impact on the adjusted net income.

And second at EUR154 million, we see significantly lower depreciation and amortization than in the first quarter of the previous year. This is due to the high impairments, mainly in our fossil fuels booked during 2023. And third, the income tax of EUR206 million corresponds to a tax rate of 26.3% for the first quarter of 2024. The tax rate reflects the mix between local and international results.

Now over to the operating cash flow on the next slide. Slide 8. In the first three months of this year, the operating cash flow came in at EUR1.45 billion. In relation to the operating profit, Uniper has a cash conversion rate of well above 100% in this period. The waterfall clearly shows that this is due to the changes in working capital of almost EUR1.1 billion in total, which follows a pattern of seasonal growth from our gas inventories.

In addition the substantial fall in gas prices [extend] (ph) lower than -- lower working capital requirements, which has a positive effect on the operating cash flow. And now to related figures of Uniper's economic net debt. At the end of the last fiscal year 2023 Uniper had an economic net cash in the amount of almost EUR3.1 billion. And at the end of the first quarter of 2024, the net cash balance improved to EUR4.5 billion, in-line with the positive operating cash flow. Capital expenditures came out at EUR79 million.

The other block mainly includes the change in asset retirement obligations and a decrease in nuclear provisions due to positive FX effects, whereas pension provisions were stable and increased in the single-digit million range due to minimal changes in interest rates. Now I'd like to conclude my presentation today with the confirmation of the given outlook for fiscal year 2024. We continue to expect an adjusted EBITDA in the range of EUR1.5 billion to EUR2 billion.

And for the adjusted net income, we continue to anticipate a range of EUR0.7 billion to EUR1.1 billion. Looking at the remainder of the year, we still expect a very solid performance in 2024 on the back of an overall group absolute very good performing business. Before I hand over to Stefan Jost, let me briefly summarize. We had a good start into the year. We are delivering on our commitments and our priorities. Before we go into the Q&A session in a couple of minutes, I would like to take a moment at the end of my presentation to thank Stefan, for whom, today's call will be the last one as Uniper's Head of Group Finance and Investor Relations.

Much to our regret, Stefan has decided to take on a new professional channel outside of Uniper. I'd like to thank him for his truly outstanding contribution to Uniper. Stefan played an irreplaceable role during to Uniper's crisis in negotiating the [SQA] (ph) solution managing government and with regards to the stabilization and financial recovery pace in the past year. We will all miss Stefan a lot. On a personal note, I wish him great success and until and his family all the best for the future. And with that, I hand over back to you, Stefan, to kick off your last Q&A session. Stefan, please.

Stefan Jost

Thank you very much for your warm words, Jutta, and always a pleasure and always good fun with our analysts and investors with such a strong IR team, also [indiscernible] recall on the call by [indiscernible].

We can start our Q&A session now. I will let my -- operator, I'm handing it over to you please.

Thank you. Now we will begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Anna Webb from UBS. Please go ahead.

Anna Webb

Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. There is two from me. Firstly, there were some reports in the press last week that the remaining Russian gas contracts you have could create risks for any re-IPO or return to the market process that I think has been discussed for 2025. So if there is anything you can comment on whether that would be an issue that would delay the time-line or if that is sort of a normal part of the business? If you could talk about that.

And I assume some of these Russian gas contracts will have rolled off anyway naturally since 2022. So if you can confirm how much you still have contracted with gas from Russia, that would be really helpful. And then secondly, sort of a related question. Is there any other conditions you have to meet before you can make any possible return to the market? I know you still have a number of asset sales to complete, including Datteln 4, as part of the nationalization EU approval. And -- but do you need to complete these before any potential return to the market? Or can you -- is that just sticking to the 2026 deadline? And then finally on that -- could you give us the latest update, if any on the remaining divestments. Thank you very much.

Jutta Donges

Thank you, Anna for your questions. Good to hear you. Let me start with the second question and then third and then come back to the Reuters article. The second question is with regard to any prerequisites for a potential return to the market and your question was relating to the list of disposals. Those two things are not linked. There is the obligation of the German government to exit by the end of 2028.

And there's obviously a long list of prerequisites that need to be fulfilled to be able to go back to the capital markets to do a re-IPO if that would be the test that the German government would decide. But this is not linked to the other remedies that we have to fulfil. But regards to [disposals] (ph) this is -- as you mentioned they need to be completed by the end of '26. And with regards to the progress, you asked whether there is anything new, we talked about this back in end of February when we talked about the full year results for the last year.

And there was the announcement that we have been able to sign a contract to sell our Hungarian asset venue. This is basically where we stand right now, we are expecting the closing of that deal in the second half of this year. And other than that -- there has been made progress in terms of preparation for the other assets that need to be disposed. And you can expect to see some news flow over the next couple of months when we will bring those potential transactions for the market.

On the first question, the Reuters article. Well I think it's known that we have been in arbitration proceedings with gas from exports since the end of 2022. The proceedings are still ongoing, and we are awaiting a recession by the tribunal during the course of this year, potentially at some point over the summer. I think that's just known news that has been in the public figure already.

And I can confirm that we still have the supply contracts with Gazprom and [indiscernible] until the middle of the 2030s. So they are in place, but we are waiting for the decision by the tribunal and would expect that we will be able -- based on the decision by the tribunal to further clarify our future position in relation to the contracts with GPE. And I can confirm, but that's probably also not really new. That's in [August 22] (ph). And until today as in our Russian gas flowing to Germany under these contracts. I hope that answers your question. I think there was a question also with regards to the volumes under those contracts, roughly 250 terawatt hour this year.

The next question comes from the line of Louis Boujard from ODDO BHF. Please go ahead.

Louis Boujard

Yes, hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Stefan also best for your new endeavor and focus on challenge. Regarding the Russian contracts, sorry, I'd like to come back a little bit on this topic, if you don't mind. More to understand what would be eventually the mitigating factor that you could put in place, meaning that probably, I guess that the central scenario is to try to cancel this contract to make sure that you don't have that flowing back to you by 2035.

But if you could not, considering the liquidity in the spot markets that you have because I guess that some of your volumes are now supplied from the spot market. Maybe don't you have some possibility to mitigate the impact by using the flexibility that you have in your new contract and replacement in gas fuel, so that you have not too much impact into your supply business, you have to commit on your take or pay contract with the recent suppliers? This is the first question.

The second question is more regarding the flexible generation business and the evolution that we could expect. [indiscernible] downward oriented. Anyway, you have a very good contribution in the first quarter. We know that there is some phasing effect embedded in it. Could you give us a bit of color by the end of the year, how it could evolve going forward? And where do you see by the end 2024? Thank you very much.

Jutta Donges

Good morning. Great. Thank you for your question. I understand that the entire topic around the Russian gas contract results of high interest. But as I said before, we are in an arbitration procedure. And therefore I want to ask you for your understanding that we cannot speculate on any of these things -- any comment on how we continue to get anything, would be possibly not only to interest for you, but to anybody else. So that is something we rather prefer to be silent about. I hope that you understand that we have made.

And on the flexible generation I think according to our outlook, we -- I can confirm again that we expect a solid result for flexible generation. We have seen in the first quarter that the extraordinary result compared to the last year and to the first quarter of last year. It has not been repeated because of two effects, mainly lower spreads and also lower volumes and coal fired assets are less than before. So volume obviously also go down. We continue to anticipate that 2024 adjusted EBITDA in flexible generation and the Greener commodities segment will be significantly below the respective prior year level. I hope that answers your question.

Louis Boujard

Thank you. Considering the first answer, do you mind if I have a follow-up on another topic, then, to have two questions? And the question would be more regarding your future development, notably regarding the CapEx plan and the investment plan. You only [post] (ph) $79 million CapEx in the first quarter, and you have $8 billion commitment for the year -- for the next six years. I would like to understand if and when you plan to actually increase and speed up these developments, notably in renewables green gas, et cetera. And if you have some firm development that you can seek at the moment and in which you could start to invest in the relatively short-term. Thank you very much.

Jutta Donges

Yes. I'm also happy to answer that question. I can understand if you look at the CapEx of the first quarter, that this is probably not in-line with the overall number for 2024 that you would expect to see. Still, there is a significant commitment to invest already this year a part of the $8 billion. The $8 billion target has not changed, but what we said before, this is true that we are dependent on clarity with regards to regulation. So the German [cut back] (ph) strategy for CCGT plan. You know that there has been an announcement that the term government has committed to having this 10 gigawatts of capacity. And we are ready for more information and clarity around -- also around the economics.

Once we have that, we will be able to make decisions on investments. We are -- from an operating perspective, we are ready to get started on this one, and I just want to stress that our ambition to play a very important part in that -- the realization of the cutback strategy has not changed. There is also some other regulation outstanding with regard to the H2 transformation, the grid and on these things. So we are waiting for those things to becoming clearer. And at the same time, we are working full steam ahead on our renewable strategy and also with regards to our commodities business where we -- as we said before, want to add more greener gases and gas derivatives, and there have been a couple of announcements just recently with regards to partnerships.

So we are working on this. We have a couple of projects, also very significant projects in terms of CapEx in the pipeline that we would expect to take the financial positions till this year. And once we have done that, we will come back to you and inform you about that and provide more clarity on that.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Ingo Becker from Kepler. Please go ahead.

Ingo Becker

Yes. Thank you good morning. You were saying this morning that you see a normalization of your earnings. Can you elaborate a little on whether you mean in flexible generation as a whole? Or how the trends look like here in gas versus coal-fired generation? And also maybe what about [global] (ph)? Do you see -- would you say you see a normalization towards historical pattern in all those reporting lines? Or are there different trends? Thank you. And also, if I may -- sorry, you're saying that apparently, the coal and the gas-fired EBITDA numbers, which show coal almost flattish and gas down apparently are impacted by the carbon phasing effect, and I was wondering how did the carbon phasing impact the gas versus the coal-fired generation EBITDA trend year-over-year? Thank you.

Jutta Donges

Yes. Good morning, Ingo. Good to hear you again. With regards to the normalization among our reporting lines, I think this is -- I can only reiterate what we said before and also back in February when we made the outlook for 2024. Has not really changed. On -- but let's go through the segments each by each. On green generation part, we said that we will actually see a normalization. But overall, we expect 2024, to be even stronger than 2023. That is because 2023 was burdened by significant provisions for the nuclear business, which we are not expecting to see again this year for 2024. And greener generation, we stick with our previously given outlook that will come out from last year. Obviously market price development had an impact on this, but we have a very good hedge levels for the outside position. And therefore, we are confident that we can stick to the outlook.

On the flexible generation well I think that Q1 gives a good indication of the full year already. And in the UK, we still see good spreads on the coal generation side. We have seen in the first quarter strong indications it is front-end loaded. And as you rightly pointed out, and as I said before, there is -- when you look at the results for the co-generation part -- there is this complicating effect which is mainly due to some of the technical assets, we have low CO2 certificates prices right now.

We will -- as we produce generation, we booked the corresponding provision for that. And the hedges will only settle at the end of the year and then the positive effect that we see now in the first quarter will reverse back and will be equaled out. So that was the effect I was referring to when I mentioned the carbon phasing positive effect. Just to make sure that nobody is over estimating the coal contribution that we had seen now in the fourth quarter. But overall, we still expect growing results from [coal] (ph) in '24.

Ingo Becker

Thank you. Jutta, can ask you would still expect the coal trend to be less down than the gas trend on a full year basis post carbon phasing, similar to what we've seen in Q1?

Jutta Donges

Well I don't think that at this point in the year we can specify that actually. Yes at least I [wouldn't] (ph).

[Operator Instructions] It seems there are no further questions. I hand the conference back to you, speakers.

Stefan Jost

All right. Then I think we can close the call. Thank you Jutta. And again, as this is my last quarterly call I would like to say thanks again the analysts and investors, yes for mainly -- for remaining so committed to Uniper during our hard times. In my view, it's definitely worth, stay tuned with the exciting Uniper journey also going forward. I will always certainly keep an eye on that. So thank you all, and we close the call for today. Thanks.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded.

Due to the EU law challenges posed by the Achmea, Komstroy and Romatsa judgments by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), investors are increasingly resorting to extra-EU jurisdictions (especially the US) to enforce their intra-EU investment treaty awards.

In the context of Spain's efforts to resist enforcement of intra-EU Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) awards, the latest ruling by the LG Essen stands out as a critical juncture. This decision is part of a broader trend observed also in other EU jurisdictions of refusing to interfere with enforcement actions brought beyond EU borders, most recently in the Netherlands.

The background: clash between the German and US judiciaries

The procedural history leading to the LG Essen decision is notable for its intricate back and forth between German and US courts.

Spain's anti-enforcement application of December 2022 was prompted by RWE's enforcement action of its €28 million ECT award against Spain (ECT award) before the US District Court of Columbia in December 2021. Spain sought an order from the LG Essen (where RWE has its headquarters) to restrain RWE from pursuing enforcement outside the EU (ie an anti-suit or anti-enforcement injunction).

RWE then turned to US Courts in March 2023, where it applied for an (anti-)anti-suit injunction ordering Spain to stay the anti-enforcement proceedings before the LG Essen.

At that point, Spain responded by filing for an (anti-)anti-anti suit injunction before the LG Essen against the anti-suit application brought by RWE in the US. While the LG Essen rejected Spain's application, it was then upheld in May 2023 on appeal by the Higher Regional Court of Hamm (OLG Hamm), which issued - for the first time ever in Germany - an (anti-)anti-anti-suit injunction in the context of investment arbitration. The OLG Hamm's underlying reasoning was rooted in the preservation of Germany's judicial sovereignty and the applicant's right to justice (here Spain). In other words, the German court held that a foreign court cannot impede or obstruct legal proceedings in Germany.

The decision: German courts should obstruct enforcement actions in the US

On 12 April 2024, the LG Essen dismissed Spain's anti-enforcement application as being inadmissible. The German court confirmed the long-standing position under German law, that anti-suit injunctions violate the principles of territoriality and state sovereignty, regardless of whether the action was directed against the party (like in the case at hand) or against a foreign state court. The German court noted that it would be contradictory if German courts were to reject anti-suit injunctions from abroad, but then issued anti-suit injunctions themselves.

Most importantly, the LG Essen held that the ECJ case law on intra-EU investment arbitration (eg Achmea and Komstroy) does not establish an obligation for German courts to prevent the enforcement of ICSID awards outside of the EU. EU courts must only prevent enforcement within EU borders.

Spain's argument that enforcing the ECT award would constitute a violation of EU law on State aid also failed. The German court noted that Spain had not yet sought authorisation from the EU Commission (which has the authority to assess and approve State aid measures proposed by EU Member States) to pay the ECT award. In other words, it was apparent to the LG Essen that Spain lacked any genuine intention to pay the ECT award.

Spain engaged in a similar multijurisdictional fight before Dutch courts, trying to prevent the enforcement of the ECT award in AES v Spain in the US. In two similarly reasoned decisions from March 2023, the District Court of Amsterdam dismissed Spain's petition. It found that by seeking an anti-suit (or anti-enforcement) injunction before Dutch courts, Spain was attempting to create an additional forum to challenge the ECT award, which it found prima facie to be impermissible under the New York Convention.

Outlook

The LG Essen decision marks a setback for Spain's efforts to obstruct enforcement of intra-EU ECT awards. The Essen and Amsterdam decisions constitute strong precedent that EU courts will not assist EU Member States unwilling to comply with investment treaty awards. Both courts held in clear terms that the CJEU case law in Achmea and Komstroy does not provide a legal basis to grant anti-suit injunctions. Rather, they found that the public international law principle of territorial sovereignty as well as the New York Convention, militate against anti-enforcement orders.

It is likely that Spain will appeal the LG Essen decision before the OLG Hamm. While it is true that the OLG Hamm had issued an anti-anti-suit-injunction in favour of Spain in the same case, it had done so solely to preserve judicial sovereignty of German courts. Due to comity considerations, it seems unlikely that the LG Essen decision will be reversed on appeal.

In the second (or even third) instance, German courts may however opt to refer the matter to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling on whether EU law - in order to uphold the principle of primacy of EU law - requires EU domestic courts to grant anti-enforcement injunctions in these circumstances. A similar approach was in fact adopted by the German Federal Court of Justice (FCJ) in its landmark decisions in Mainstream v Germany, Uniper v Netherlands and RWE v Netherlands. There, the FCJ essentially stretched procedural tools available to ensure primacy of EU law and declare those intra-EU investment arbitrations inadmissible, even though the ""closed"" ICSID system does not allow for state court review.

It remains to be seen whether the OLG Hamm, the FCJ or the ECJ (if requested to opine on the matter) will adopt a similar stance in this case.

At the moment, such scenario seems unlikely. As pointed out by the LG Essen, the principle of primacy of EU law merely requires EU Member States to ensure the application and observance of EU law in their respective territory. Thus, it does not provide a basis for resisting enforcement of investment treaty awards beyond EU borders.",lexology.com,news,Lexology,,0.2549019607843137,453052081,1,https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png,

OKG, owned by energy group Uniper, has used electricity produced by Oskarshamn to produce hydrogen through electrolysis of water since 1992.

This hydrogen was initially produced to meet the nuclear power plant's own needs. It was added to the reactor coolant of the station's three boiling water reactors to reduce the risk of stress corrosion cracking of the reactor piping by reducing the amount of free oxygen in the coolant.

Units 1 and 2 at Oskarshamn were permanently shut down in 2017 and 2016 respectively, so the hydrogen produced at the facility is now only needed for Unit 3.

Hynion has hydrogen refuelling stations in a number of Swedish regions. Transport group MaserFrakt recently agreed to refuel its first hydrogen-powered trucks at Hynion's Swedish facilities.

Hydrogen, which is said to have zero emissions, can be used as a fuel for most transport applications, but is particularly well suited to larger vehicles where batteries are less viable.

The Hydrogen UK industry group says hydrogen is expected in future to be the dominant choice for heavy good vehicles, aircraft and ships.

Safety policies, training and education, prevention of harassment, violence and discrimination, and nurturing health and work-life balance are areas where a one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate, especially considering the gender-specific hazards women face in construction and maintenance environments.

'Women and men are biologically different, so we need to acknowledge our differences in the workplace regarding Health and Safety policies and practices. Women face critical issues, specifically in construction sites, where we experience, for example, inadequate hygiene conditions. Although every worksite is legally mandated to have a toilet, this is often not the case. We also experience Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) issues that do not meet our specific body needs, as most are designed for men. At Faria Renewables, we recognize the importance of occupational safety and health, and we aim to improve inclusivity and diversity at construction sites and ensure that women's needs are addressed,' says Thalia Valcouma, CEO & President at Faria Renewables, an international developer and operator headquartered in Greece.

According to the PPE Survey 2024 from the Women´s Engineering Society (WES), 27% of women vs 60% of men have comfortable or perfect-fitting PPE. As a result, women face tripping hazards, restricted movement and unsafe working conditions because of ill-fitting PPE. Generally, women's PPE is inconsistent with high street clothing and does not consider different stages of life such as periods, maternity or menopause. As a result, 'women are put at risk by the equipment meant to prevent harm, and are underrepresented in professions needing PPE and are leaving the workforce as a result.'

'It is common to blame the lack of female representation in STEM roles on education, but we need to reflect on how we are retaining and supporting the growth of women engineers so they can become role models for new joiners and future generations in the solar and energy storage industry. We have a general lack of industry-specific data that proves hazards, and there are no industry standards so exposure of women to hazards highly depends on company standards. Associations, in general, are not addressing the issues to support different types of organizations on their journey to inclusive HS environments. That WES survey states that Women's PPE is seen as a women's issue and not a health and safety concern for employers and policymakers. Still, we can agree that the issue extends to many other aspects in the industry,' says Carmen Madrid, Founder of the WiSEu Network.

Innovation is playing a key role and bringing a shine of hope to address equity issues, explains Canan Koç Yasar, VP HSSE-S at Uniper Renewables: 'The future of health and safety expertise is likely to involve increased integration of technology, such as wearable devices for monitoring health metrics and AI-driven analytics for identifying and mitigating risks. Digitization has significantly empowered women in the health and safety business by streamlining processes, enhancing communication, and providing access to critical information. With digital tools and platforms, women can efficiently manage safety protocols, track compliance, and analyze data to identify potential hazards and mitigate risks.

'Remote monitoring technologies enable them to oversee operations from anywhere, ensuring safety standards are upheld even in decentralized work environments. Additionally, digital training resources offer flexible learning opportunities, enabling women to acquire new skills and certifications to advance their careers in health and safety. Overall, digitization facilitates inclusivity and enables women to play a more active role in promoting workplace health and safety.'",pv-magazine.com,news,pv magazine International,,0.1137254901960785,453039784,1,https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rumsey_000453_172904_518319_4578_36792942462-280x280.jpg,

Fortum has announced plans for a hydrogen pilot plant near to its Loviisa nuclear power plant, while OKG has signed a contract with Hynion to supply surplus hydrogen from operations at the Oskarshamn plant to its hydrogen filling stations.

Uniper-owned OKG has used electricity produced by the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant in Finland to produce hydrogen through electrolysis of water since 1992. This hydrogen was initially produced to meet the nuclear power plant's own needs: the hydrogen was added to the reactor coolant of the plant's three boiling water reactors in order to reduce the risk of stress corrosion cracking of the reactor piping by reducing the amount of free oxygen in the coolant.

The hydrogen produced at Oskarshamn is now only required for use in unit 3 of the nuclear power plant following the permanent closure of units 1 and 2 in June 2017 and December 2016, respectively, leaving an overcapacity. OKG has modernised the hydrogen plant to expand operations and signed its first contract to supply fossil-free hydrogen from the plant to industrial gases company Linde in 2022.

All businesses in Uniper's portfolio have two main tasks: to ensure a secure energy supply and to drive the energy transition, and the company is playing an important role in the establishment of Europe's hydrogen economy and the development of a significant business in renewable energy, OKG CEO Johan Lundberg said. ""It's fantastic that the surplus production we sell can help Hynion with hydrogen to their hydrogen filling stations so that together we can contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.""

Hynion said the partnership represents an important part of its strategy to reduce dependence on individual suppliers as it prepares for increasing hydrogen-powered traffic in Sweden. ""We need stable producers who, together with us at Hynion, want to contribute to the energy transition and a carbon-free future. The hydrogen delivery from OKG is an important step to secure the supply of hydrogen at our stations,"" said Hynion AS CEO Slavica Djuric.

In a separate announcement, Finnish utility Fortum said it will build a hydrogen production pilot plant in in the Källa area near the company's Loviisa nuclear power plant. Construction of the test centre, on land already owned by the company, will begin this summer, and the plant is scheduled to be commissioned in late 2025.

Hydrogen will be produced by electrolysers with a capacity of around 2 MW, using electricity from the main grid and local domestic water supplies in Loviisa. A filling station will be built in connection with the plant for the delivery of hydrogen to industrial customers. The Källa test centre is expected to be in operation for around two years, and the total R&D cost of the pilot project is around EUR17 million (USD18.3 million). The test centre is being funded entirely from Fortum's research and development funds.

""Testing hydrogen production at the Kalla test centre on a megawatt scale will provide valuable information not only in terms of the design and operation of potential larger plants, but also of the business opportunities provided by green hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives,"" said Satu Sipola, vice president of Power-to-X at Fortum. ""The pilot project is the first step towards possible future projects and investments.""

""Fortum has a strong position in clean energy production, and we strive to find solutions to help our industrial customers decarbonise their operations. We work to drive the development of clean hydrogen in the Nordic countries, and we engage in active research cooperation with companies in the forest, steel and chemical industries and the transport sector, for example,"" Sipola said.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.2,452965352,5,,eng-9549982

About the challenges we face. Our ambitions. And how we'll achieve them. We also look forward to hearing your view of things.

First, let me have a look at last year.

If I only had one sentence to describe 2023, I'd say: Uniper is back. After the crisis in 2022, 2023 was the year of our comeback, but also a year of consolidation. The two are closely linked.

We successfully took significant steps to realign Uniper:

In the first half of the year, the Uniper Management Board was completely reshuffled.

With this new line-up, we presented Uniper's ambitious strategy for new, greener growth on August 1, 2023. A significant acceleration of our transformation through 2030. This will also accelerate the energy transition and at the same time help maintain the viability of German and European industry.

Financially, 2023 was surprisingly positive. We achieved the best financial results since Uniper's foundation.

Adjusted EBIT of €6.4 billion was about €17 billion above the crisis year 2022. Adjusted EBIT of €4.4 billion was also significantly above the prior year.

These exceptionally good earnings are the result of a strong operating performance in a market environment that was generally advantageous for Uniper.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1450980392156862,452887515,30,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners P/S (CIP) has reached an agreement with Düsseldorf-based Uniper SE to bring hydrogen from the Danish west coast to Germany.

The memorandum of understanding that CIP signed through its Energy Transition Fund paves the way for the delivery of green hydrogen from CIP's HØST PtX Esbjerg project to Germany. The MoU, according to a media release, will drive collaboration on the production, transport, and marketing of green hydrogen from the HØST PtX Esbjerg project.

It is expected that HØST will be connected to the German hydrogen backbone by 2028 at the latest. The connection would be established via a new hydrogen pipeline. The two companies said the pipeline would be developed by the Danish transmission system operator Energinet in cooperation with Gasunie Deutschland Transport Services. This will enable access to consumption sites in Germany and help bring competitively priced green hydrogen to the German market, according to the media release.

CIP and Uniper will jointly provide up to 140,000 tons of green hydrogen per year to customers in Germany. Uniper plans to include green hydrogen from HØST in its green gas portfolio to meet the industry's needs with flexibility and various contract durations, the companies said.

""We see great potential in this collaboration. HØST fits our strategic target of achieving at least 1 GW installed electrolyzer capacity by 2030 and our other electrolyzer developments in Germany such as Green Wilhelmshaven. Uniper's diversified hydrogen portfolio consists of various supply sources to guarantee competitive and secure supplies in line with customer needs"", Uniper COO Holger Kreetz said.

""This is an important step for CIP and the HØST PtX Esbjerg project. With the vast renewable energy potential from the North Sea as well as the planned hydrogen pipeline connecting Denmark to Germany, we are excited to take the next step in bringing the green hydrogen from the HØST project to German customers. While CIP has a significant portfolio of power-to-gas projects, Uniper's strong position with German energy customers is a key enabler in establishing this new market"", Karsten Plauborg, Partner at CIP, added.

The HØST PtX Esbjerg is developing an industrial electrolysis technology to produce green hydrogen and ammonia on a gigawatt scale, powered by renewables. This initiative aims to supply green hydrogen and ammonia to industrial, fertilizer, and fuel sectors, supporting long-term sustainability in hard-to-electrify industries, according to the project developers.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.1607843137254903,452845900,22,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/CIP-Uniper-Ink-Deal-for-Export-of-Hydrogen-from-Denmark-to-Germany-176665-582x327.webp,eng-9541087

You can also hear directly from our customers of Nationwide, Carl Zeiss, Uniper, Fratome and Criteo at the event.

Point three of our 4-point strategy, powerful free cash flow generation. We are targeting an F '24 free cash flow of $725 million to $800 million, and our medium-term aspiration by fiscal '27 of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion or 20% plus of free cash flow as a percent of revenue. We expect to achieve these higher free cash flow aspirations through a series of actions, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from a technology-enabled business through leveraging our data, automation and AI. We are just getting started in deploying AI internally. Completing all Micro Focus integration expense, lower special charges over time, lower interest charges and potentially lower rates over time. It is a combination of margin expansion, more technology enablement, elimination of integration expense and a reduction in interest burden that is the path to our free cash flow aspirations.

Point four, disciplined capital allocation. We expect to pay down our debt on May 6 by USD 2 billion, and with our net leverage ratio now below 3x, we are increasing our return of capital to shareholders by introducing a $250 million buyback and reentering the M&A market with a new framework that is future oriented, while leveraging the best parts of our operational discipline. You will see in our investor presentation today our capital allocation strategy comprised of 2 elements: primary and additional allocation.

For the primary, we intend to allocate 50% of our trailing 12 months free cash flow to dividends and buybacks. We have a strong dividend track record, as you know, returning $1.9 billion over the last decade. I'm now pleased to add a buyback program to that return strategy. As noted, our target is 50% of trailing 12 months free cash flow allocation, and we're going to start higher with a $250 million buyback, and we intend to return again between $450 million to $500 million to shareholders in fiscal '25.

For the additional part, we intend to allocate the other 50% of trailing 12-month free cash flows to cloud-based M&A. Further, we are excited about the M&A opportunity for information management in the cloud for higher recurring revenues. We intend to cast a wide net across information management for established technologies with proven customer value propositions.

We are looking for small- to medium-sized cloud companies that will benefit from our business system, general operations, benefit from our distribution and benefit from our multibillion-dollar cloud foundation and cloud operations. We'll always seek value in organic growth. You can expect us to complete multiple M&A transactions in the coming year while growing organically.

Let me turn to our financials and our medium-term aspirations. For Q3, our results reflect strong execution and strong customer trust. On cloud bookings, $165 million, up 53% year-over-year. We more than doubled our $1 million-plus wins year-over-year, from 13 to 28. Average cloud deal size is up 30%. Contract terms are longer. Customers are increasing their commitments for long-term durations with ramps to full value. Our investment is also up to fuel that growth, to get customers ramped and to introduce new capabilities like AI and IoT.

We had total revenues of $1.4 billion, up 16% year-over-year. We ended cash of $1.1 billion and free cash flow of $348 million, up 14%, and just had fantastic wins at Akamai, Nestlé, Shell, Tyson Foods, BAE Systems and MAN. Recall, we're an annual business. And for full fiscal '24, our targets include cloud bookings growth between 33% to 38%, 6% to 8% cloud growth, total revenues between $5.745 billion to $5.795 billion and free cash flows between $725 million to $800 million, up from $655 million last year.

Today, we're also presenting preliminary F '25 targets and subject to change. These preliminary targets are without the AMC business. We're expecting enterprise bookings of 20% plus, cloud revenues of up to $1.9 billion, total revenues between $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion, free cash flows between $575 million to $650 million, which includes, really important, which includes a onetime $250 million tax payment for the AMC divestiture.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.584313725490196,452790797,1,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

Hydrogen is essential in the chemical and oil and gas industries. Blue, grey, and green hydrogen are the three categories into which hydrogen recovered from various procedures is divided. Grey hydrogen is created using fossil fuels when carbon capture and storage are not used. Furthermore, this form of hydrogen releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Factors Influencing Market Growth

- Increase in demand from chemical industries and the development of electric vehicles driven by hydrogen cells drive market growth.

- The government's increase in spending on various technologies boosts the effectiveness of hydrogen extraction. Thus, it is expected to propel the market growth.

- Increase in governmental restrictions for the desulfurization of petroleum products. Thus, it is anticipated to boost the market expansion.

Study of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the market. Due to the lockdown enacted by the government, the closure of an industrial company caused a reduction in the demand for solar-related equipment in most countries around the world, which slowed the growth of the market for hydrogen generation. Power usage in industrial facilities around the world has decreased due to the pandemic.

Lockdowns initially caused a large drop in hydrogen demand. Furthermore, since a significant amount of hydrogen is produced by natural gas reforming, the supply of hydrogen was constrained. However, governments loosened lockdown regulations. As a result, the production process has been increasing steadily and the need for hydrogen in industrial applications is being driven.

Regional Insights

Asia-Pacific is expected to dominate the market. Hydrogen plays a significant role in this region due to its ease of conversion into and out of power and its ability to generate electricity for future use. This region is the most populous and is made up of numerous emerging and underdeveloped nations. In addition, a sizable number of megacities are located there, and the population is constantly growing. Ammonia, a primary raw element in agricultural chemicals, is in high demand because the majority of the countries in this region are based on agriculture.

Furthermore, a rise in the use of ethanol-blend fuel in this region as well as ongoing reforms in India to enhance the amount of ethanol mixed in the gasoline. During the forecast period, the aforementioned investments and policies will play a significant role in propelling market expansion in this region.

Germany had to nationalize Uniper in 2022 to avoid its collapse amid soaring gas prices and a lack of Russian supply in the wake of the Ukraine invasion and the EU sanction barrage. The total bill for the nationalization came in at $53 billion.

To replace lost Russian gas volumes, European buyers switched to U.S. LNG, with exports of the commodity from the U.S. Gulf Coast soaring to record highs last year. Uniper has been especially active on the spot market, uncertain about long-term gas demand in Europe.

In November 2022, Uniper initiated arbitration proceedings against Gazprom, claiming that the replacement of gas deliveries from Gazprom after the halt of Russian gas supply cost Uniper around $12.5 billion (11.6 billion euros) to that date.

As the case dragged on, a Russian court issued on March 13, 2024, an interim injunction against Uniper in favor of Gazprom Export, according to which Uniper is prohibited from continuing the arbitration proceedings initiated against Gazprom Export, otherwise a fine worth billions of euros must be paid to Gazprom Export, Uniper said in its Q1 quarterly results statement.

The German utility said Tuesday that it had filed an appeal against the ruling in Russia, calling the March 13 decision from the Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region a violation of international law and the principle of fair trial.

Uniper launched proceedings against Gazprom Export in Stockholm, Sweden, toward the end of 2022 to claim compensation for gas it hadn't received from Gazprom Export under long-term gas supply contracts following Russia's decision to throttle natural-gas deliveries to Europe.

Uniper had to procure replacement volumes at higher prices through different sources to meet its own obligations to customers, incurring costs of about 13.2 billion euros ($14.21 billion) in 2022, according to the group's annual report.

The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region ruled in March that Uniper could no longer pursue arbitration proceedings internationally, or it would allow Gazprom Export to claim EUR14.3 billion in damages, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

""We expect a judgment in the arbitration proceedings against Gazprom Export in the coming months,"" a Uniper spokesman said, adding the company didn't wish to speculate on a decision and possible consequences. Gazprom Export didn't respond to a request for comment.

MOSCOW, May 7. /TASS/. Germany's Uniper concern admits that the ruling by a Russian court prohibiting the company's subsidiary from continuing the arbitration proceedings against Gazprom Export abroad may allow the Russian company enforce Uniper's assets within Russia and possibly even outside of the country, Uniper said in a report.

""On March 13, 2024, a Russian court issued an interim injunction against Uniper in favor of Gazprom Export, according to which Uniper is prohibited from continuing the arbitration proceedings initiated against Gazprom Export, otherwise a fine worth billions of euros must be paid to Gazprom Export.

""Uniper is examining the impact on the Group's risk and chances situation as well as any further legal steps.

Earlier, the Court of Arbitration of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region sustained Gazprom Export's claim against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Metha-Methanhandel GmbH banning continuation of international arbitration proceedings. In the event of violation of the ban, the court ruled to recover 14.3 bln euros from German companies in favor of Gazprom.

In late November 2022, it became known that the German concern Uniper filed a lawsuit against Gazprom Export to compensate for losses incurred from the short supply of Russian gas. Uniper then estimated the current costs of replacing Russian gas at no less than 11.6 bln euros. The Russian company, in turn, stated that it was studying the received statement of claim from Uniper, but it did not recognize the violation of contracts and the legality of the German company's stated claims for damages.

Uniper considered the force majeure declared by Gazprom on gas supplies to be a violation of the contract. Since the end of August 2022, the German concern has completely stopped receiving gas from Russia and it considers this a violation of contractual obligations on the part of Gazprom. Uniper stated that it did not expect the resumption of Russian gas supplies and it was awaiting a decision in the court case with Gazprom Export due to their termination in 2024.",tass.com,news,TASS,,0.2549019607843137,452769820,63,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,eng-9546604

Uniper has sold 70% of its German hydropower output for 2025 at an average price of 126 euros ($135.64) per megawatt hour (MWh) and 5% of the output in 2026 at an average of 90 euros/MWh, it said.

By comparison, the wholesale benchmark price for round-the-clock German power from all generation sources in 2025 closed at 95.05 euros on Monday, and at 81.75 euros for 2026, LSEG data showed.

The discrepancies come from lower-priced fuel elements in the overall wholesale level.

That level also reflects gas-generated power and hydropower market conditions that are subject to national support schemes and hard-to-predict weather patterns.

Producers use hedging to reduce the impact of price volatility and to lock in forward production prices considered favourable at a certain point in time.

The wholesale market uses the rates to track price trends and assess a utility's physical asset position.

Uniper has so far sold 85% of its 2024 German output at 54 euros after achieving an average price of 34 euros for sales in 2023.

The company also operates coal, gas-fired, and nuclear plants in Europe as well as wind and solar power generation units that were not reflected in the presentation's slides.

Regarding Nordic prices, Uniper said it sold 45% of nuclear and hydropower in the region for 2025 and 25% of output for 2026 at average prices of 39 euros and 37 euros, respectively, having achieved 42 euros for 60% of 2024 output, and 41 euros in 2023.

The German gas importer on Tuesday said net income for the first quarter was 477 million euros ($513.7 million) from EUR6.75 billion in the same period a year ago.

Sales nearly halved to EUR17.98 billion from EUR34.209 billion.

The company said the drop was related to though comparatives, as in 2023 it had benefited from the reversal of provisions for anticipated losses from procurement of replacement volumes of gas.

The company added that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization--which strips out exceptional and other one-off items--came in at EUR885 million from EUR991 million.

Adjusted Ebitda is guided to be in the range of EUR1.50 billion to EUR2.00 billion, compared with EUR7.16 billion.

Adjusted EBITDA in the prior-year period amounted to €991 million.

Effective this financial year, Uniper reports on the basis of three segments: Green Generation, Flexible Generation, and Greener Commodities. The new segmentation reflects the company's new strategic course. Adjusted EBITDA has replaced adjusted EBIT as the company's financial performance indicator.

The Green Generation segment's adjusted EBITDA of roughly €278 million was below prior-year earnings of €298 million. The nuclear energy business in Sweden benefited from a price-driven increase in earnings on successful hedging transactions and from higher output. This was more than offset by narrower margins at the hydropower business in Sweden and Germany due to lower prices.

Flexible Generation's adjusted EBITDA decreased from the prior year's €901 million to €656 million, in particular because of lower positive earnings from successful hedging transactions in the fossil portfolio due to the overall decline in prices. Lower expenses on the measurement of provisions for carbon allowances had a positive effect year-on-year, mainly because of declining prices for carbon allowances. Allowance prices had risen in the year-earlier period. Expenses on the measurement of provisions are offset by hedging transactions that will not be settled until the fourth quarter of 2024.

In the first three months of 2024, Uniper's direct Scope 1 carbon emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity and heat amounted to 5.5 million metric tons (prior-year period: 6.3 million metric tons). This roughly 12% decline is primarily attributable to lower electricity output at some coal-fired power plants in Germany due to the comparatively unfavorable commercial market conditions for such plants.

Adjusted EBITDA at Greener Commodities improved year-on-year, but remained negative at -€13 million (prior-year period: -€242 million). Following the extraordinarily adverse performance in the first quarter of 2023, whose causes included the liquidity measures taken in 2022, the gas business made a much more positive contribution in the first quarter of 2024. The electricity trading business was unable to repeat the particularly positive prior-year earnings it generated in a volatile market environment.

Adjusted net income of €570 million in the first quarter of 2024 surpassed the prior-year figure of €458 million, in particular because of good interest earnings.

Despite an improved gross margin, IFRS net income of €477 million was, as anticipated, below prior-year net income of €6,753 billion, whose positive factors included the release of provisions for anticipated losses for gas replacement procurement as such losses were no longer foreseen.

Economic net debt at year-end 2023 was -€3,058 million. Significantly positive operating cash flow of €1,450 million gave Uniper an economic net debt of -€4,524 million at the end of the first quarter of 2024. This thus remains an economic net cash position.

Uniper affirmed its earnings forecast for the 2024 financial year. The company continues to expect its adjusted EBITDA for full-year 2024 to be in a range of €1.5 to €2 billion and adjusted net income in a range of €0.7 to €1.1 billion.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.223529411764706,452756517,18,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,
