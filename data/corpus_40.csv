It is hard not to feel like the Weimar Triangle - France, Germany, and Poland - has been overdone in the media recently.

It is probably safe to say that the overwhelming majority had never heard of this construct until leaders decided last year to dig it out from the closet of tried and failed post-Cold War ideas.

Suddenly, the Weimar approach is being hailed everywhere as the panacea for all evil that engulfs the three countries, including curing the long-suffering Franco-German friendship.

There is little, it seems, that the Weimar Triangle cannot do.

But even now, after having covered countless Weimar Triangle meetings, this reporter is struggling to find a catchy description that sums up what exactly it is.

Is it a forum, a diplomatic platform, a dialogue format, or an alliance?

Let's be honest - the simplest explanation is probably that whenever representatives of France, Germany, and Poland meet, they call it a Weimar Triangle meeting.

Historically, it has hardly ever lived up to being more than that.

Befallen by 'End of History' euphoria, the three countries' foreign ministers had unveiled the format as a talk shop to integrate Eastern European countries into Western structures shortly after the Iron Curtain came down.

Since then, the Triangle's Wikipedia page reads like a protocol of leaders vowing to revive it every five years or so - ""No, for real this time"".

That is basically what happened again when Donald Tusk regained power in Poland last autumn.

Before that, the format had once more gone through one of those dormant periods between the regular 'grand revival' announcements, as Poland's previous hard-right government was - diplomatically speaking - not very interested in fraternising much with Germany.

But at the risk of being proven wrong, like everyone else who ever uttered this phrase - this time, it feels different.

That became clear last week when the Triangle's foreign ministers unveiled the Weimar Agenda, outlining a number of foreign and security policy measures they want to implement throughout the EU's next five-year mandate.

For context: Following the EU elections, the bloc's leaders must decide on the priorities for the next Commission in June.

More than ever, the tasks are daunting: preparing the EU for a possible Russian attack and playing catch-up with America and China. Meanwhile, Viktor Orbán is ready to make it all come crashing down, which appeared to unnerve even battle-hardened EU diplomats this week.

Against this backdrop, the Weimar meeting hinted that the three countries increasingly see the Triangle as the EU's own G7, an inner-circle club where three of the bloc's most important economies commit to implementing ideas when others are too slow.

""The Weimar Triangle is intended to be a think tank that provides impulses for Europe,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters at the meeting in Weimar.

Thinking one bold step ahead, another mothballed 1990s concept that was recently revived springs to mind: The idea of a multi-speed Europe, whereby a coalition of willing countries moves forward with integration, with others gradually following suit.

Merely creating a regularised and institutionalised format for the forum could already move the Triangle well in that direction.

Not only could this help tackle the EU's deadlock and provide a framework for how the bloc could enlarge with new members, which currently seem hardly ready to join.

It could also provide an insurance against the next round of disinterest in the Triangle among the three Weimar partners - just to ensure that it does not need life support again in a couple months.

When a fire broke out in Ikea in Vilnius in Lithuania this month, few passed any remarks until the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, suggested it could have been the work of a foreign saboteur.

Investigators have already alleged potential Russian involvement in an arson attack in east London, an inferno that destroyed the largest shopping mall in Poland, a sabotage attempt in Bavaria in Germany and antisemitic graffiti in Paris.

While there is no evidence that any of these incidents across the continent are coordinated, security services believe they could be part of an attempt by Moscow to destabilise the west, which has backed Ukraine.

They point out that after the cold war, foreign intelligence operations consisted of spies and their handlers, but in the era of social media, vandals can be hired, leaving few connections to other attackers as pay-as-you-go saboteurs paid a few hundred euros or in cryptocurrency.

Such is the emerging concern that these hybrid attacks could be the work of Russia that the issue was raised at a summit of foreign and defence ministers in Brussels this week with Dutch, Estonian and Lithuanian security officials all warning of national vulnerabilities.

One minister, who asked not to be named said, they were deeply worried about ""sabotage, physical sabotage, organised, financed and done by Russian proxies"".

Last week, Tusk revealed Polish authorities had arrested nine people in connection with acts of sabotage allegedly committed on the orders of Russian services.

He said the crimes allegedly included ""beatings, arson and attempted arson"" with investigators looking into whether Russia was involved in the fire in a shopping centre in Warsaw, a claim the Russian embassy described as a conspiracy theory.

A spokesperson for Ikea said investigations were continuing into the source of the fire in Lithuania but it was among the examples, along with an attempted arson attack on a paint factory in Poland, that Tusk cited in his warning of potential foreign interference.

In April, a British man was accused of orchestrating an arson attack on two units linked to a Ukrainian businessman in an industrial estate in Leyton, east London, after allegedly being recruited by Russian intelligence. The Crown Prosecution Service claimed he was ""engaged in conduct targeting businesses which were linked to Ukraine in order to benefit the Russian state"".

On Tuesday, the Estonian defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, in Brussels for an EU defence summit, said the country had already been the victim of Russian sabotage.

""They have conducted similar operations in Estonia. They hired 10 people to attack the car of the interior minister and a journalist's car. This is normal behaviour of Russia. We are sorry to say but we need to understand that Russia is more and more aggressive towards European countries and also Nato countries,"" he said.

He was referring to incidents in February when the windows of cars belonging to the interior minister, Lauri Läänemets, and a journalist were smashed.

Six people were arrested shortly afterwards, including Russian nationals and dual Russian-Estonian citizens, the prosecutor said.

In Germany, there are also suspicions of foreign intelligence-driven attacks in addition to a wave of cyber-attacks in 2023 by a hacker group linked to Russian intelligence.

Last month, two German-Russian nationals were arrested on suspicion of plotting sabotage attacks including on a military base in Bavaria. The main suspect has been accused of plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence.

Investigators in France are considering whether graffiti painted on Paris's Holocaust memorial last week was ordered by Russian security services.

It has echoes of an attack last year when the Star of David was spray-painted on buildings in and around Paris, prompting fears of a recurrence of Nazi-era attempts to identify the homes of Jewish people. Authorities later said they believed the attack may have been a ""demand"" of an individual living abroad.

The attacks, European officials fear, add to an already proliferating disinformation campaign. On Wednesday, several schools around Athens were evacuated after a bomb hoax. Police traced the stunt to a Russian server and said it was aimed at ""disrupting public order"".

EU countries are tracking these events. Lithuania's national crisis management centre (NKVC) has warned businesses including shopping centres and organisations supporting Ukraine to heighten their vigilance.

Vilmantas Vitkauskas, the head of the NKVC, told reporters two weeks ago: ""The threat level is quite high. We urge the public to remain vigilant.""

On Monday, the Dutch national coordinator for security and counter-terrorism warned of the risk of subversive operations in the Netherlands including ""espionage and pre-positioning for sabotage of vital infrastructure"".

In Brussels on Tuesday, the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said Russia was ""trying to intimidate"" Nato countries, making EU member states vulnerable.

""Yes, we are vulnerable. I think all of us are. We have vital infrastructure. We have seabed infrastructure, we have electricity supplies, water supplies, we're vulnerable to cyber-attacks. We are seeing now in several European countries that Russia is trying to destabilise us and also to intimidate us.

""I think this has been a way that Russia and also the Soviet Union has worked throughout recent history, really; in the 75 years of Nato I think we've seen it often,"" she said.

Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has also pointed the finger at Moscow. ""We have seen several arrests across the alliance and different Nato allied countries of people who are accused of arson or sabotage. These are of course ongoing legal processes,"" he said. ""But what I can say is that we have seen increased Russian intelligence activity across the alliance. Therefore we have increased our vigilance.""

Between 6-9 June, around 360 million people across the EU will vote for representatives from national parties to sit in the European Parliament.

The grouping or coalition with the most seats will help to shape the leadership of the next European Commission. The overall composition of parliament will also influence the bloc's priorities between 2024-2029.

Climate change and energy once again feature prominently in the manifestos of the major parties, with mounting pressure to secure energy supplies in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine drawing particular focus.

Core to this is a transition to decarbonised domestic energy. Carbon Brief's analysis shows that the relatively small nations of Portugal, Latvia and Finland have led the way since the last EU election, with the largest percentage drop in power-sector emissions between 2019 and 2023.

Malta and the Netherlands have led in increasing their renewables shares, with the Netherlands also seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation.

Meanwhile, fossil-fuel generation fell in all but three countries when comparing 2019 and 2023.

Other key findings from the analysis include:

In this analysis, Carbon Brief looks at how the electricity sector has changed since the last election.

Every national power system across the EU has become cleaner since the last European Parliamentary election in 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

Finland led the way in terms of reducing grid intensity - the measure of how clean the electricity within national grids is - halving its intensity between 2019 and 2023 to become the third cleanest in the EU, behind France and Sweden.

In absolute terms, Greece reduced its grid intensity the most since 2019, Carbon Brief shows. The country hit a new record high level of clean energy generation, with power grid operator IPTO announcing that renewables and hydroelectric plants accounted for 57% of the country' energy in 2023.

Germany saw the largest fall in power-sector emissions in absolute terms - namely, the overall volume of CO2 emissions produced. Like Greece, the country had a ""landmark"" 2023 for renewable generation, according to thinktank Ember.

Carbon Brief analysis shows that power-sector emissions in Germany fell by 43.23m tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), or 18.4%, of 2019 values by 2023.

Despite this significant drop, the country's power sector is still the most polluting of all EU countries, responsible for 29.3% of EU power-sector emissions. This places it far ahead of Poland, the second largest polluter, which is responsible for 17% of emissions.

Germany has one of the largest populations in Europe and its energy demand sits at 514TWh (19% of EU total). When looking at per-capita emissions (as shown below), the country sits fourth in the EU for emissions, seeing a reduction of 0.51tCO2 in 2023 compared with 2019.

Portugal, Latvia and Finland decarbonised their power sectors the most relative to 2019, analysis shows.

Portugal saw renewables supply 61% of its electricity consumption in 2023, according to the country's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais. This totaled 31.2TWh - the most it has ever recorded. This included a period in November where the country ran on just renewables for six days in a row.

Carbon Brief's analysis of Ember data placed the 2023 figure even high, with 73% of electricity from renewable sources.

As shown in the chart below, there were just three EU countries where power-sector emissions have increased since 2019 - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania. These countries are some of the smallest in Europe, collectively accounting for less than 1% of total EU power generation in 2023.

Malta increased its power-sector emissions by 0.11MtCO2, or 10.3%, of 2019 emissions. As an island nation, Malta's energy system is still heavily dominated by imported oil and gas, making up nearly 90% of power generation. (Malta has some of the lowest per-capita emissions in Europe, with 5.3 tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per inhabitant in 2019, well below the EU average of 8.4tCO2e.)

Croatia, where emissions increased by 0.4MtCO2 or 13%, is similarly reliant on fossil fuels, with coal still dominating its power sector. While power demand has remained stable in recent years, net imports of electricity have dropped likely due to higher electricity prices in neighbouring countries.

Although renewable generation offset most of this, it did lead to a small jump in fossil fuel use of ~1TWh.

Lithuania saw emissions increase by 0.32MtCO2, from 0.57MtCO2 in 2019 to 0.89MtCO2 in 2023, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country is currently heavily reliant on electricity imports, after the closure of its only nuclear power plant in 2010 changed it from a net exporter to a net importer.

Chris Rosslowe, senior energy and climate data analyst at Ember, tells Carbon Brief:

""Trends in generation in Lithuania don't tell you as much as in other countries as it imports most of its electricity since shutting down nuclear power in 2010. Import dependence is slowly lowering though - from ~75% in 2019 to ~55% in 2023 - and, like Croatia, renewables are growing faster than fossils.""

It is undergoing a particularly key period of transition. Lithuania's electricity grid currently operates synchronously with the Russia-Belarus power system, but it is planning to de-synch by 2025 and instead run with the continental Europe grid.

Additionally, it is among the countries that are seeing the fastest expansion of wind generation. It is also targeting halving its imports and generating 70% of its electricity from domestic sources by 2030, as it pushes for increased energy sovereignty and security.

Rosselowe notes that Malta, Croatia and Lithuania are all expected to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels in the coming years, offset in large part by growing renewables.

Overall, the Czech Republic remains the biggest per-capita emitter in the EU, as shown in the chart below. Between 2019 and 2023, emissions in the country did drop from 4tCO2 to 3.2tCO2, but it still sits 0.9tCO2 above the second highest per-capita emitter Cyprus (3.1tCO2).

The three countries that saw an increase in per-capita emissions match those where there was an increase in fossil fuel generation - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania.

Between 2019 and 2023, the share of renewable generation in the EU increased in all by one country, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Italy saw renewable generation fall from 115.83 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2019 to 114.8TWh in 2023. This was broadly due to the impact of droughts in the country affecting hydropower generation, which hit in 2022, but had a continued impact in 2023.

This was a wider dynamic seen globally, which kept the world from hitting peak electricity generation emissions in 2023.

Slovakia, meanwhile, was the only country to see a dip in its share of renewable energy when comparing 2019 and 2023. This was minor, falling just 0.65% from 23.57% to 22.92%. The country has one of the smallest energy demands in Europe and, like Italy, saw a drop in hydro driven by droughts in 2022.

Malta and the Netherlands saw their share of renewables increase by more than 150% in 2023 relative to 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

The Netherlands increased its absolute share of renewable generation by close to 30% since 2019, as shown in the chart below. The country seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation, closely followed by Spain.

Nearly half the electricity produced in the Netherlands is now renewable, according to the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics.

This was predominantly wind generation, with the country adding more wind power than any other country in the EU between 2019 and 2023, both relatively and in absolute terms. Overall, the Netherlands increased its wind generation by 152% and Finland followed closely behind with a 143% rise.

Latvia, similarly, saw significant growth, with the share of renewables jumping from 49.5% in 2019 to 76.6% in 2023. This 27.1% increase is particularly key for the country, as it continues to target reducing its dependence on energy imports from Russia.

Spain added more solar generation in absolute terms over the four-year period than any other country in the EU, tripling its overall renewable generation.

Poland increased its solar generation by more than 1,500%, increasing generation by 12TWh albeit from a low starting point of just 0.71TWh in 2019. Renewables generated a record 26% of electricity in the country in 2023. However, coal still produces most of the country's electricity and continues to have a powerful impact on policy due to powerful lobbies.

Hungary has increased its solar share of generation the most since 2019, with an increase of 14%. It was followed closely by the Netherlands, with a 12.8% increase. Luxembourg increased wind power share of generation by more than the Netherlands - 17%.

Overall, just three EU countries - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania - saw an increase in the share of fossil fuel generation in 2023 relative to 2019, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Over the same period, Luxembourg and Finland reduced fossil generation by more than 60%.

The Netherlands has reduced its fossil fuel share in the electricity system the most since 2019, falling by close to 30%. As shown in the chart below, this fall was mirrored by a significant increase in renewable energy generation.

In comparison with 2019, Ireland saw an increase in coal generation in 2023 making it the only EU nation to do so. In 2019, coal generation was at a record low in the country (0.51TWh) before jumping to 2.72TWh in 2022 due to a drop in wind generation.

However, since that point coal power generation has been continuing to fall again, in line with the wider trend seen over the past few decades.

Ireland has seen total electricity demand increase by more than 60% since 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country's energy demand has been particularly driven by the growth of data centres, which accounted for 18% of energy demand in 2022, for example.

Despite the blip in coal generation, the share of fossil fuels fell by 2.5% between 2019 and 2023.

Portugal reduced its use of coal the most, relative to 2019, while Germany reduced the most in absolute terms. As discussed above, this was supported by surging renewable generation in both countries.

Pieter de Pous, programme lead in E3G's fossil fuel transition programme, tells Carbon Brief:

""Europe's phaseout of coal has been one of its biggest, most historical, monumental success stories of the last couple of years when you think about it. We've dropped consumption since 2016 by 50%, right? It's really enormous and it's a story that's rarely told.""

The last European Parliament elections saw a ""green wave"" of climate-focused politicians winning seats across the continent. In the years that followed, the EU approved a European Green Deal, including goals to cut emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.

European member states now have a ""critical role"" to play in implementing what has been agreed, notes Rosslowe. He adds:",carbonbrief.org,news,Carbon Brief,,0.1764705882352942,454852151,88,https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2RA0468.jpg,

Walton became a broadcaster and last year he called a foul on misguided government policies in San Diego, the same policies now causing misery across California.

""I love San Diego and it breaks my heart what's happening to it now,"" said Walton a 27-minutes speech last October. The dream had become a ""nightmare"" and the city faced an ""existential challenge.""

Balboa Park, near Walton's residence, is ""not safe,"" and ""downtown for same reason."" Bike trails were jammed with trash and the Embarcadero ""a travesty."" For Walton, this was due to homeless people who failed to grasp ""the first thing you learn in life - clean up after yourself."" As Walton saw it, the homeless were also into criminality.

""They steal everything,"" Walton said, including water, electricity, and ""our mail."" This forced Walton to ""call the police every single day."" In his speech, he called out career politicians who ""never had another job,"" especially San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He had done ""a lot of preaching"" but had ""no plan whatsoever.""

Gloria had ""instructed our police force to not enforce the rules on homeless people. That is unacceptable."" On the other hand, it wasn't quite true that Gloria had no plan. He was an advocate of the Housing First policy of Gov. Gavin Newsom.

""'Housing First' is not working, has never worked, and will not work,"" contended Walton. If Californians have doubts, economist Lawrence McQuillan shows why Newsom's plan is not working.

Only Hawaii surpasses California as the most expensive place to build housing, and it takes about five years ""from concept to move-in."" This expense, largely due to excessive regulation, has saddled California with a ""severe housing shortage.""

Housing First makes few demands on the homeless themselves, and crowds out both shelter space and treatment solutions. For every person housed under the current plan, ""up to four more become newly homeless."" Simply putting a roof over the head of people with substance abuse and mental illness ""does not resolve their root causes of homelessness and may make matters worse.""

Housing First, McQuillan has explained, is ""a misguided, budget-busting, Sisyphean pipe dream of the state's political class, which has produced concentrated urban areas of human misery such as The Jungle (San Jose), Skid Row (Los Angeles), the Tenderloin (San Francisco), and Wood Street (Oakland).""

Squalor also prevails in many parts of Sacramento and San Diego, once billed as ""America's Finest City.""

Like McQuillan, Bill Walton supported high-tech shelter tents as a stop-gap measure, but the ""political will"" is not there. With the departure of Walton, the city, state and nation have lost an eloquent advocate for common-sense policies. Still, there's more about him people should know.

Walton was a big fan of Lithuanian center Arvydas Sabonis, ""a combination of Kareem, Larry Bird, and Pete Maravich."" Before 1991, the Lithuanians were forced to play for the Soviet Union. They wanted to field their own national team for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, but their country lay in ruins. Golden State Warriors assistant coach Donnie Nelson sought out the Grateful Dead.

The group's foundation cut the Lithuanians a big check and had their logo designer send a box of tie-dyed T-shirts in Lithuania's national colors, with an image of a skeleton dunking a basketball. The Lithuanians defeated Russia for the bronze medal and the victors posed in their T-shirts.

Walton became a broadcaster and last year he called a foul on misguided government policies in San Diego, the same policies now causing misery across California.

""I love San Diego and it breaks my heart what's happening to it now,"" said Walton a 27-minutes speech last October. The dream had become a ""nightmare"" and the city faced an ""existential challenge.""

Balboa Park, near Walton's residence, is ""not safe,"" and ""downtown for same reason."" Bike trails were jammed with trash and the Embarcadero ""a travesty."" For Walton, this was due to homeless people who failed to grasp ""the first thing you learn in life - clean up after yourself."" As Walton saw it, the homeless were also into criminality.

""They steal everything,"" Walton said, including water, electricity, and ""our mail."" This forced Walton to ""call the police every single day."" In his speech, he called out career politicians who ""never had another job,"" especially San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He had done ""a lot of preaching"" but had ""no plan whatsoever.""

Gloria had ""instructed our police force to not enforce the rules on homeless people. That is unacceptable."" On the other hand, it wasn't quite true that Gloria had no plan. He was an advocate of the Housing First policy of Gov. Gavin Newsom.

""'Housing First' is not working, has never worked, and will not work,"" contended Walton. If Californians have doubts, economist Lawrence McQuillan shows why Newsom's plan is not working.

Only Hawaii surpasses California as the most expensive place to build housing, and it takes about five years ""from concept to move-in."" This expense, largely due to excessive regulation, has saddled California with a ""severe housing shortage.""

Housing First makes few demands on the homeless themselves, and crowds out both shelter space and treatment solutions. For every person housed under the current plan, ""up to four more become newly homeless."" Simply putting a roof over the head of people with substance abuse and mental illness ""does not resolve their root causes of homelessness and may make matters worse.""

Housing First, McQuillan has explained, is ""a misguided, budget-busting, Sisyphean pipe dream of the state's political class, which has produced concentrated urban areas of human misery such as The Jungle (San Jose), Skid Row (Los Angeles), the Tenderloin (San Francisco), and Wood Street (Oakland).""

Squalor also prevails in many parts of Sacramento and San Diego, once billed as ""America's Finest City.""

Like McQuillan, Bill Walton supported high-tech shelter tents as a stop-gap measure, but the ""political will"" is not there. With the departure of Walton, the city, state and nation have lost an eloquent advocate for common-sense policies. Still, there's more about him people should know.

Walton was a big fan of Lithuanian center Arvydas Sabonis, ""a combination of Kareem, Larry Bird, and Pete Maravich."" Before 1991, the Lithuanians were forced to play for the Soviet Union. They wanted to field their own national team for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, but their country lay in ruins. Golden State Warriors assistant coach Donnie Nelson sought out the Grateful Dead.

The group's foundation cut the Lithuanians a big check and had their logo designer send a box of tie-dyed T-shirts in Lithuania's national colors, with an image of a skeleton dunking a basketball. The Lithuanians defeated Russia for the bronze medal and the victors posed in their T-shirts.

What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman's firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.

What does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.

While there is a more...nefarious side to ChatGPT, it's clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.

Prior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (a super-charged version of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model) and a multimodal API. OpenAI also unveiled the GPT store, where users could create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT. Though the launch was delayed in December, it officially launched in January.

GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft's Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT.

Here's a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

The Atlantic and Vox Media have announced licensing and product partnerships with OpenAI. Both agreements allow OpenAI to use the publishers' current content to generate responses in ChatGPT, which will feature citations to relevant articles. Vox Media says it will use OpenAI's technology to build ""audience-facing and internal applications,"" while The Atlantic will build a new experimental product called Atlantic Labs.

OpenAI announced a new deal with management consulting giant PwC. The company will become OpenAI's biggest customer to date, covering 100,000 users, and will become OpenAI's first partner for selling its enterprise offerings to other businesses.

OpenAI announced in a blog post that it has recently begun training its next flagship model to succeed GPT-4. The news came in an announcement of its new safety and security committee, which is responsible for informing safety and security decisions across OpenAI's products.

On the The TED AI Show podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner revealed that the board did not know about ChatGPT until its launch in November 2022. Toner also said that Sam Altman gave the board inaccurate information about the safety processes the company had in place and that he didn't disclose his involvement in the OpenAI Startup Fund.

The launch of GPT-4o has driven the company's biggest-ever spike in revenue on mobile, despite the model being freely available on the web. Mobile users are being pushed to upgrade to its $19.99 monthly subscription, ChatGPT Plus, if they want to experiment with OpenAI's most recent launch.

After demoing its new GPT-4o model last week, OpenAI announced it is pausing one of its voices, Sky, after users found that it sounded similar to Scarlett Johansson in ""Her.""

OpenAI explained in a blog post that Sky's voice is ""not an imitation"" of the actress and that AI voices should not intentionally mimic the voice of a celebrity. The blog post went on to explain how the company chose its voices: Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky.

OpenAI announced new updates for easier data analysis within ChatGPT. Users can now upload files directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, interact with tables and charts, and export customized charts for presentations. The company says these improvements will be added to GPT-4o in the coming weeks.

OpenAI announced a partnership with Reddit that will give the company access to ""real-time, structured and unique content"" from the social network. Content from Reddit will be incorporated into ChatGPT, and the companies will work together to bring new AI-powered features to Reddit users and moderators.

OpenAI's spring update event saw the reveal of its new omni model, GPT-4o, which has a black hole-like interface, as well as voice and vision capabilities that feel eerily like something out of ""Her."" GPT-4o is set to roll out ""iteratively"" across its developer and consumer-facing products over the next few weeks.

The company announced it's building a tool, Media Manager, that will allow creators to better control how their content is being used to train generative AI models -- and give them an option to opt out. The goal is to have the new tool in place and ready to use by 2025.

In a new peek behind the curtain of its AI's secret instructions, OpenAI also released a new NSFW policy. Though it's intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI -- or any generative AI vendor -- can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically.

In a new partnership, OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow's API and will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT. However, the deal was not favorable to some Stack Overflow users -- leading to some sabotaging their answer in protest.

Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post, are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles ""without permission and without payment"" to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot.

OpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe, London's Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. ""Through the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,"" the FT wrote in a press release.

OpenAI is opening a new office in Tokyo and has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language. The move underscores how OpenAI will likely need to localize its technology to different languages as it expands.

According to Reuters, OpenAI's Sam Altman hosted hundreds of executives from Fortune 500 companies across several cities in April, pitching versions of its AI services intended for corporate use.

Premium ChatGPT users -- customers paying for ChatGPT Plus, Team or Enterprise -- can now use an updated and enhanced version of GPT-4 Turbo. The new model brings with it improvements in writing, math, logical reasoning and coding, OpenAI claims, as well as a more up-to-date knowledge base.

You can now use ChatGPT without signing up for an account, but it won't be quite the same experience. You won't be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have ""slightly more restrictive content policies,"" according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:

""The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,"" a spokesperson said.

TechCrunch found that the OpenAI's GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools.

In a court filing opposing OpenAI's motion to dismiss The New York Times' lawsuit alleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that ""OpenAI's attention-grabbing claim that The Times 'hacked' its products is as irrelevant as it is false."" The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls.

At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI's VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists ""opt out"" of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous.

ChatGPT's environmental impact appears to be massive. According to a report from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day.

OpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps. The feature allows ChatGPT to read its responses to queries in one of five voice options and can speak 37 languages, according to the company. Read aloud is available on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models.

As part of a new partnership with OpenAI, the Dublin City Council will use GPT-4 to craft personalized itineraries for travelers, including recommendations of unique and cultural destinations, in an effort to support tourism across Europe.

New York-based law firm Cuddy Law was criticized by a judge for using ChatGPT to calculate their hourly billing rate. The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure ""well above"" reasonable demands.

ChatGPT users found that ChatGPT was giving nonsensical answers for several hours, prompting OpenAI to investigate the issue. Incidents varied from repetitive phrases to confusing and incorrect answers to queries. The issue was resolved by OpenAI the following morning.

The dating app giant home to Tinder, Match and OkCupid announced an enterprise agreement with OpenAI in an enthusiastic press release written with the help of ChatGPT. The AI tech will be used to help employees with work-related tasks and come as part of Match's $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024.

As part of a test, OpenAI began rolling out new ""memory"" controls for a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won't erase ChatGPT's or a custom GPT's memories -- you must delete the memory itself.

Initially limited to a small subset of free and subscription users, Temporary Chat lets you have a dialogue with a blank slate. With Temporary Chat, ChatGPT won't be aware of previous conversations or access memories but will follow custom instructions if they're enabled.

But, OpenAI says it may keep a copy of Temporary Chat conversations for up to 30 days for ""safety reasons.""

Paid users of ChatGPT can now bring GPTs into a conversation by typing ""@"" and selecting a GPT from the list. The chosen GPT will have an understanding of the full conversation, and different GPTs can be ""tagged in"" for different use cases and needs.

Screenshots provided to Ars Technica found that ChatGPT is potentially leaking unpublished research papers, login credentials and private information from its users. An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report.

OpenAI has been told it's suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy's data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven't been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: ""We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.""

In an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers, OpenAI announced it's partnering with Common Sense Media to collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT as lacking in transparency and privacy.

After a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus questioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI's board, the company responded. The response, signed by CEO Sam Altman and Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, said building a complete and diverse board was one of the company's top priorities and that it was working with an executive search firm to assist it in finding talent.

In a blog post, OpenAI announced price drops for GPT-3.5's API, with input prices dropping to 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. GPT-4 Turbo also got a new preview model for API use, which includes an interesting fix that aims to reduce ""laziness"" that users have experienced.

OpenAI has suspended AI startup Delphi, which developed a bot impersonating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) to help bolster his presidential campaign. The ban comes just weeks after OpenAI published a plan to combat election misinformation, which listed ""chatbots impersonating candidates"" as against its policy.

Beginning in February, Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT's Enterprise tier, which the university plans to use to build a personalized AI tutor, develop AI avatars, bolster their prompt engineering course and more. It marks OpenAI's first partnership with a higher education institution.

After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudan admitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences ""verbatim."" Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI.

In a conversation with Bill Gates on the Unconfuse Me podcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be ""fully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support."" Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024.

OpenAI is forming a Collective Alignment team of researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and ""encoding"" public input on its models' behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI's public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a ""democratic process"" for determining the rules AI systems follow.

In a blog post, OpenAI announced users will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for ""personalized persuasion.""

Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting.

The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT.

In an unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of ""military and warfare."" In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to ""harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.""

Aptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs.

After some back and forth over the last few months, OpenAI's GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI's partners and the wider dev community.

To access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI's premium ChatGPT plans -- ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team.

Following a proposed ban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbots in the U.K., OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be ""impossible"" to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law ""does not forbid training.""

OpenAI published a public response to The New York Times's lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit.

In the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to ""act responsibly.""

After being delayed in December, OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Store sometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch. OpenAI says developers building GPTs will have to review the company's updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines to ensure their GPTs are compliant before they're eligible for listing in the GPT Store. OpenAI's update notably didn't include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront.

In an email, OpenAI detailed an incoming update to its terms, including changing the OpenAI entity providing services to EEA and Swiss residents to OpenAI Ireland Limited. The move appears to be intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union, where the company has been under scrutiny over ChatGPT's impact on people's privacy.

A study conducted by professors from Harvard and MIT, which is still under review, looked at how ChatGPT could affect the productivity of more than 750 white-collar workers, as well as their complicated feelings about using the tool. The study found that while ChatGPT was helpful with creative tasks, workers were led to more mistakes with analytical work.

In a lawsuit filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, The Times argues that millions of its articles were used to train AI models without its consent. The Times is asking for OpenAI and Microsoft to ""destroy"" models and training data containing offending material and to be held responsible for ""billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages.""

OpenAI has struck a new deal with Berlin-based news publisher Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider and Politico, to ""help provide people with new ways to access quality, real-time news content through our AI tools."" OpenAI will train its generative AI models on the publisher's content and add recent Axel Springer-published articles to ChatGPT.

New research from Stanford University shows that the popularization of chatbots like ChatGPT has not caused an increase in cheating across U.S. high schools. In a survey of more than 40 U.S. high schools, researchers found that cheating rates are similar across the board this year.

Starting in November, ChatGPT users have noticed that the chatbot feels ""lazier"" than normal, citing instances of simpler answers and refusing to complete requested tasks. OpenAI has confirmed that they are aware of this issue, but aren't sure why it's happening.

Some users think it plays into the ""winter break hypothesis,"" which argues that AI is worse in December because it ""learned"" to do less work over the holidays, while others wonder if the chatbot is simulating seasonal depression.

The U.K. Judicial Office issued guidance that permits judges to use ChatGPT, along with other AI tools, to write legal rulings and perform court duties. The guidance lays out ways to responsibly use AI in the courts, including being aware of potential bias and upholding privacy.

Following an experiment by Google DeepMind researchers that led ChatGPT to repeat portions of its training data, OpenAI has flagged asking ChatGPT to repeat specific words ""forever"" as a violation of its terms of service.

City lawmakers in Brazil enacted a piece of legislation written entirely by ChatGPT without even knowing. Weeks after the bill was passed, Porto Alegre councilman Ramiro Rosário admitted that he used ChatGPT to write the proposal, and did not tell fellow council members until after the fact.

According to a memo seen by Axios, OpenAI plans to delay the launch of its highly anticipated GPT store to early 2024. Custom GPTs and the accompanying store was a major announcement at OpenAI's DevDay conference, with the store expected to open last month.

After launching for iOS and Androidin May and July, ChatGPT's have topped 110 million combined installs and have reached nearly $30 million in consumer spending, according to a market analysis by data.ai.

OpenAI hit a major milestone: one year of ChatGPT. What began as a ""low-key research preview"" evolved into a powerhouse that changed the AI industry forever. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman looked back on the night before its launch: ""what a year it's been...""

Neither Apple nor Google chose an AI app as its app of the year for 2023, despite the success of ChatGPT's mobile app, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history before the record was broken by Meta's Threads.

A test led by researchers at Google DeepMind found that there is a significant amount of privately identifiable information in OpenAI's LLMs. The test involved asking ChatGPT to repeat the word ""poem"" forever, among other words, which over time led the chatbot to churn out private information like email addresses and phone numbers.

According to a new report by SlashNext, there's been a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails since Q4 of 2022. The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.

Following speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa's November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT. South African presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya refuted the claims, and local officials are investigating.

Now that OpenAI's ChatGPT Voice feature is available to all free users, it can be used to replace Siri on an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max by configuring the new Action Button. The new feature lets you ask ChatGPT questions and listen to its responses -- like a much smarter version of Siri.

Altman's return came swiftly, with an ""agreement in principle"" announced between him and OpenAI's board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.

Even if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the ""headphones"" icon.

The only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.

""Obviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they're not going to be in OpenAI,"" Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was ""open"" to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.

A number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company's board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT's future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.

Sam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company's board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board ""no longer has confidence in [Altman's] ability to continue leading OpenAI.""

In a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI ""was transformative"" for him and ""hopefully the world.""

OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.

Following OpenAI's Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus' new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.

An independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety.

OpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.

OpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that's strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.

As opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says -- largely due to technical hurdles.

Users and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI's marketplace and monetize it in the future.

After being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.

DALL-E 3, OpenAI's text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI's newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.

Bowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don't extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.

OpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.

At its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build ""agent-like experiences"" within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.

OpenAI's chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it's surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like ""Chat & Ask AI"" and ""ChatOn -- AI Chat Bot Assistant"", are actually making more money than ChatGPT.

Subscribers to ChatGPT's Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.

OpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.

The integration means users don't have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.

A Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the ""trustworthiness"" -- and toxicity -- of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of ""jailbreaking"" prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.

OpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures -- dropping from 30% to 20% in September.

OpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.

OpenAI announced that it's adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.

The Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT -- accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI's premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot -- receiving the results directly within the chat app.

Powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.

The new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.

OpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system's image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.

ChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds ""enterprise-grade"" privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.

Recent Pew polling suggests the language model isn't quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.

With fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company's API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model's ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the ""feel"" of the model's output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.

OpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.

Fine-tuning costs:

In OpenAI's first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.

""We're very excited for the impact they'll have here at OpenAI,"" OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. ""The entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.""

OpenAI announced that it's expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service. The feature allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding.

Multiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple's China App Store ahead of the country's latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.

""As you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),"" Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. ""Based on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.""

A few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.

ChatGPT is available to ""pre-order"" for Android users.

The ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version's features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too -- so if you're iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.

OpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don't have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.

The company said this feature lets you ""share anything you'd like ChatGPT to consider in its response."" For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.

The FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI's flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made ""false, misleading, disparaging or harmful"" statements about people.

TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:

This kind of investigation doesn't just appear out of thin air -- the FTC doesn't look around and say ""That looks suspicious."" Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there's evidence the company lied about the side effects.

Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers ""with a history of successful payments"" can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.

In the future, OpenAI says that it'll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI's other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.

OpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.

The Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting ""GPT-4"" in the model switcher and choosing ""Browse with Bing"" from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.

U.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car's conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car ""Hey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.""

It's not really clear what for, though.

The new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.

On iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet's interface.

The Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that ""no portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,"" or if it was, that it was checked ""by a human being.""

The list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.

OpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.

The ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries -- Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon!

-- OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023

ChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.

When using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices -- meaning it will know what you've previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI's open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.

Meta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users' devices.

""In one case, we've seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,"" said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. ""They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.""

VC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft's investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.

Called ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as ""for professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.""

""ChatGPT Business will follow our API's data usage policies, which means that end users' data won't be used to train our models by default,"" OpenAI wrote in a blog post. ""We plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.""

OpenAI applied for a trademark for ""GPT,"" which stands for ""Generative Pre-trained Transformer,"" last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the ""myriad infringements and counterfeit apps"" beginning to spring into existence.

Unfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI's attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide ""appropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.""

That means a decision could take up to five more months.

Auto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI's latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to ""autonomously"" perform tasks.

Depending on what objective the tool's provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very... unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running -- and then ""killed"" itself.

FTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to ""turbocharge"" fraud in a congressional hearing.

""AI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,"" Khan told the House representatives. ""And I think we've already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We've been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,"" she stated.

The company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat's AI features.

Italy's data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month -- when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU's GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals' data.

The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline -- of April 30 -- to get the regulator's compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)

A study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a ""persona"" -- for example, ""a bad person,"" ""a horrible person"" or ""a nasty person"" -- through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity -- with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.

The research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI's GPT-4.

YC Demo Day's Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building ""ChatGPT for X."" They're all chasing after a customer service software market that'll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.

Here are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:

OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.

Italy's data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people's data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it's concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.

The letter's signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on ""all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.""

The letter reads:

Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.

OpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot's functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it'll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.

GPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.

ChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft's fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be ""Microsoft managed customers and partners,"" can apply here for special access.

OpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat's parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.

After ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for ""ChatGPT Professional"" as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.

OpenAI said that it's ""starting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT"" in an announcement on the company's official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no ""blackout"" windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT -- ""at least 2x the regular daily limit.""

A week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers -- Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston -- made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI's answers with the world.

GPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that's essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI's DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at it's 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

Much like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.

ChatGPT's generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been ""learning"" for a longer period of time than Bard.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is ""coming soon.""

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness -- in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Bard and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder -- if not impossible -- to run today.

The Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI's ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind's AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.

Apple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.

OpenAI has said that individuals in ""certain jurisdictions"" (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression ""in accordance with applicable laws"".

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled ""OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request"".

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on ""legitimate interest"" (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out -- when it writes: ""See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.""

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

The user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Security services in Europe are on high alert after a series of mysterious fires and attacks on infrastructure in the Baltics, Germany and the UK.

Security services have not ruled out that these actions are a potential new weapon for Russia to use to destabilise Europe.

As the British Guardian reports, the fire that broke out at IKEA in Vilnius, Lithuania this month went virtually unnoticed until Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk did not rule out that it could be the work of a foreign saboteur.

Already, authorities have suggested that Russian involvement in an arson attack in east London, a fire that destroyed Poland's largest shopping mall, an attempted sabotage in Bavaria and anti-Semitic graffiti in Paris have not been ruled out.

They are alarmed over concerns of sabotage

Although there is no evidence that any of the incidents are coordinated, security agencies believe they could be part of an effort by Moscow to destabilise the West, which has sided with Ukraine. Since the Cold War, foreign intelligence operations have consisted of spies and their handlers. But in the age of social media, saboteurs can be recruited, taking a reward of a few hundred euros or cryptocurrency.

The issue was also discussed at a summit of foreign and defence ministers in Brussels this week, with security officials from the Netherlands, Estonia and Lithuania warning of national vulnerabilities.

One minister, who asked not to be named, said they were deeply concerned about ""sabotage, physical sabotage, organised, financed and carried out by Russian proxies"".

The attacks that cause concern

Last week, Tusk revealed that Polish authorities had arrested nine people in connection with acts of sabotage allegedly committed at the behest of Russian agencies. He said the crimes allegedly included ""beatings, arson and arson attempts"", while investigators are looking into whether Russia was involved in the Warsaw shopping centre fire, an allegation the Russian embassy called a conspiracy theory.

An Ikea spokesman said investigations were continuing into the cause of the fire in Lithuania, but it was among the examples, along with an arson attempt at a paint factory in Poland, that Tusk cited in his warning of possible foreign involvement.

In April, a British man was accused of orchestrating an arson attack on two plants linked to a Ukrainian businessman at an industrial site in Leighton, east London, after allegedly being recruited by Russian intelligence services. The Crown Prosecution Service claimed he ""engaged in conduct targeting businesses linked to Ukraine in order to benefit the Russian state"".

""Russia is increasingly aggressive""

On Tuesday, Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur, who is in Brussels for an EU defence summit, said the country had already been the victim of Russian sabotage.

""They have carried out similar operations in Estonia. They hired 10 people to attack the car of the interior minister and the car of a journalist. This is normal Russian behaviour.

We are sorry to say it, but we have to understand that Russia is increasingly aggressive towards European countries and NATO countries,"" he said, referring to incidents in February when they smashed the windows of the cars of Interior Minister Lauri Läänemets and a journalist.

Six people were arrested shortly afterwards, including Russian nationals and dual Russian-Estonian citizens, the prosecutor said.

They are investigating sabotage

In Germany, there are also suspicions of attacks led by foreign intelligence agencies, in addition to a wave of cyberattacks in 2023 by a hacker group linked to Russian intelligence agencies.

Last month, two German-Russian nationals were arrested on suspicion of planning sabotage attacks, including on a military base in Bavaria. The main suspect is accused of planning an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence services.

Investigators in France are looking into whether the graffiti painted on the Holocaust memorial in Paris last week was commissioned by Russian security services.

Last year in Paris, some people spray-painted the Star of David on buildings in and around Paris, sparking fears of a repeat of Nazi-era attempts to identify Jewish homes. Authorities later said they believed the attack may have been a ""claim"" by a person living abroad.

The Athens school bomb hoax

The attacks, European officials fear, add to an already proliferating campaign of misinformation.

The Guardian report recalls that on Wednesday, several schools in Attica were evacuated after a bomb call turned out to be a hoax. Police traced it to a Russian server and said the hoax was aimed at ""disturbing public order"".

EU countries are following these events. Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre (NKVC) has warned businesses, including shopping centres and organisations supporting Ukraine, to increase their vigilance.

Vilmantas Vitkauskas, head of the NKVC, told reporters two weeks ago: ""The threat level is quite high. We urge the public to remain vigilant.""

""We are vulnerable.""

The Netherlands was warned of espionage and preparation for sabotage of vital infrastructure, with the Dutch defence minister telling the Brussels summit that Russia was ""trying to intimidate"" NATO countries, making EU member states vulnerable.

""Yes, we are vulnerable. I think we all are. We have vital infrastructure. We have infrastructure at the bottom of the sea, we have electricity supplies, water supplies, we are vulnerable to cyber attacks. We see now in several European countries that Russia is trying to destabilise us and also to intimidate us.

""I think that's been a way that Russia and also the Soviet Union have operated throughout recent history, really; in the 75 years of NATO I think we've seen it a lot,"" he said.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also pointed to Moscow. ""We've seen a number of arrests across the alliance and in various NATO allies of people accused of arson or sabotage.

These are, of course, ongoing legal proceedings,"" he said. ""But what I can say is that we have seen increased Russian intelligence activity across the alliance.

These countries were part of the erstwhile USSR and gained independence in 1991. Baltic states lack sufficient locally available energy resources and diversification of energy supply; consequently, they depend on energy imports, especially from Russia.

All three Baltic states joined the EU in 2004 to improve energy security and diversify energy supply. Their move to the EU did not bring the expected outcome as they remained largely dependent on the Russian supply. Until the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022, the Baltic states were entirely energy-dependent on Russian energy supplies. Such massive energy dependency on Russia was considered a threat to their national security. However, after the start of the conflict, despite their reliance on the Russian energy supply, the Baltic states were among the first to decide to cease energy imports from Russia. The Russia-Ukraine conflict seriously impacted the Baltic states' energy security as it brought significant policy-level changes to the Baltic states.

In 2021, the total combined natural gas consumption of the Baltic states was approximately 4 billion cubic meters (bcm), wherein Estonia (0.5 bcm), Latvia (1.5 bcm) and Lithuania (2.3 bcm) shared respectively. Compared to 2020, there was an increase in supply by 1%. In April 2022, Baltic states stopped importing Russian natural gas. Existing energy infrastructure in the Baltic states enabled them to stop Russian supplies. These energy infrastructures are LNG terminal Klaipeda, Estlink 1 and 2, Gas Pipeline Poland and Lithuania (GIPL), NordBalt, and Incukalns gas storage facility.

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict increased energy prices unexpectedly at the global and the EU level. In 2023, Estonia spent more than 40 % on energy purchasing compared to September 2022. The conflict hit the Estonian economy badly. As per Eurostat, in September 2022, there was a 24.2% annual inflation rate. Since the conflict escalated in February 2022, Estonia continuously faced severe inflation, which remains the highest in the EU. After the start of the conflict, Estonia took a daring step and curbed most of the import of Russian energy supplies.

Before the conflict, the import of refined petroleum and natural gas from Russia was 55% and 95% of Estonia's total import of these resources. After one year of the conflict, Russia's energy resources supply was significantly reduced to 5% and 7%, respectively. Reducing Russian energy supplies (mainly gas) and replacing it with coal and other polluting fuels increased the energy price in Estonia

After the conflict - to ensure a proper energy supply and replace Russian imported energy- Estonia sped up the initiative to build a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal at Paldiski. However, the proposal for the construction of LNG at Paldiski came long before the February conflict (2017). The construction of the first LNG dock will be completed in October 2022. It is still under construction, and it is believed that the terminal will be connected to electricity and gas transmission system operation after the completion of the terminal. This new LNG terminal will help Estonia diversify its energy supply, especially when all three Baltic countries try to prohibit Russian energy resources.

For Latvia, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its international reaction exposed several domestic weaknesses, including the energy sector. Latvia's response to the conflict explicitly advocated the EU's economic and energy sanctions on Russia. Since independence, Latvia's electricity system has depended on the Russian-controlled BRELL (Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) system. Latvia's power grid is not synchronized with continental Europe's, making it vulnerable as Latvia is totally dependent on Russia. Within a few weeks of the start of the conflict, in March 2022, Latvia's parliament Saeima agreed to prepare legislation aiming at a permanent ban on the import of electricity from the BRELL power grid by 2025.

In the autumn of last year, Latvia experienced the highest prices for purchasing natural gas and electricity. This led to a decrease in demand and consumption of natural gas. Compared to 2021, demand for natural gas decreased by 38 per cent in the first half of 2022. However, sudden energy efficiency measures and aid by the Lithuanian government have a positive impact on reducing the energy price impacts on enterprises and domestic households.

Due to an unexpected surge in energy prices, inflation in Latvia remained above 20 per cent in mid-2022. As per Latvijas Banka, the increase in energy prices for businesses and household sectors cost approximately €1.7 billion in 2022. The Latvian government's partial compensation for energy prices decreased inflation, and economic activities increased. To reduce the impact of the energy crisis in sectors such as electricity, gas, heating, transportation and household sector, Latvia spent around €700 million in 2022.

To address uncertainty about natural gas supply, the Ministry of Economics of Latvia and Latvenergo (a state-owned energy company) finalised an agreement with the LNG terminal, Klaipeda and non-EU gas importers. In addition, the Latvian government also considered cooperating with the Paldiski LNG terminal and building a new LNG terminal at Skulte or in Riga. However, in early 2023, due to regional overcapacities of LNG, the Skulte LNG construction was put on hold. Moreover, Latvia emphasised evaluating the national nuclear energy programme to fill the gap between the demand and supply of energy, advance the energy system and achieve energy independence. In addition, on 30 August 2022, all three Baltic states signed the Marienborg declaration to improve wind energy.

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has huge geopolitical and strategic implications for Lithuania. The former Prime Minister of Russia in June 2022 commented that ""if Ukraine fails, the Baltic states will be following (LRT 2022). And, as per exiled Russian business tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia will start with Lithuania. Such comments made some ground when a bill was introduced in the Russian Duma in June 2022 to remove recognition of Lithuanian independence.

Within a month, Lithuania faced a severe cyber attack targetting state-owned state owned energy companies. For Lithuania, like the other two Baltic states, the conflict resulted in a surprise increase in energy prices (a 190% increase in wholesale price), leading to inflation. In September 2022, inflation peaked (22%), and economic growth was measured at only 1.9%. To address the energy crisis and reduce energy prices, Lithuania aimed to advance the production of RES to 70% of the total domestic power consumption by 2030 and 100% by 2045. Also, the Lithuanian government adopted a package for temporary financial support measures to reduce the conflict's social and economic impact. Moreover, on September 22, 2022, the Lithuanian government announced an energy subsidy that covered around 80% of the price increase. Similarly, the government announced compensation of 80% of the price increase in the gas and central heating sector.

Following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Lithuania gradually reduced its reliance on Russian energy imports by redirecting them through the LNG terminal in Klaipeda, the oil terminal in Butinge, the new gas interconnection with Poland, the enhanced interconnection with Latvia, and the existing electricity interconnections with Poland, Latvia, and Sweden. In addition, Lithuania also plays a significant transit role in the supply of natural gas to Kaliningrad Oblast. Amid this conflict, deliveries to Kaliningrad Oblast have not been halted but are being carried out at a reduced level. Due to a transit contract between Lithuania and Russia for ten years, natural gas supply did not cease functioning.

The Russia-Ukraine war highlighted the need to expedite the Baltic states' energy transition and pressured policymakers to make the necessary choices and trade-offs. The Baltic states' long-term strategy for energy security, which is to diversify the energy supply, is a significant approach. However, due to high pricing and commercial and political pressures, Baltic states are maintaining their stand on the conflict. The war also allowed the Baltic states to pace energy diversification activities at policy and infrastructural levels, which may help them strengthen their energy security. Due to the ongoing conflict, all three Baltic states voiced their opinions against Russia, which shows that the conflict allowed them to facilitate cooperation. Amid this conflict, the increasing role of renewable energy resources seems to be a leading player in meeting energy demand in the Baltic states. The war gave the Baltic states confidence to survive without the Russian supply and with the temporary energy crisis. However, it seems it will help them achieve energy independence in a larger framework.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,,0.3254901960784313,454697286,63,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/b-89.jpeg,

Intelligence experts have warned that Europe is under a growing threat from Russian sabotage operations, and believe those operations aim to secure concrete military results in Ukraine, political and economic costs to Europe, and nuisance value.

""We are experiencing the early stages of a systematic activation of Russian sleeper cells worldwide,"" Joseph Fitsanakis, professor of Intelligence and National Security Studies at Coastal Carolina University, told Al Jazeera. ""This is an unprecedented phenomenon in Western post-war history.""

The Financial Times this month cited intelligence of imminent Russian hybrid operations in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and a report from Chatham House, a London-based think tank, detailed incidents across Europe that ""match predictions of what Russia would attempt to do in advance of an open conflict with NATO"".

The author of that report told Al Jazeera that Russia has a scattershot of aims, including causing trouble just to see what will happen.

""Russia has this view of security where anything they do to damage us is relatively speaking good for them because it makes them stronger,"" said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House. ""That in itself is an incentive to do things which are disruptive.""

In late April, two Finnair flights were forced to return home after GPS jamming prevented them from landing at Tartu, Estonia's second-largest city. The airline suspended flights for a month to find an alternative landing system.

The Finnish transport agency blamed Moscow.

""It is possible that the interference observed in aviation currently [is] most likely a side effect of Russia's self-protection. In practice, self-protection interference is used to prevent the navigation and control of drones controlled by [global navigation satellite systems] or mobile frequencies,"" it said in a statement. ""The interference has not only remained within Russia's borders, but has also reached Finnish territory.""

Giles explained, that the GPS jamming ""may have started with absolutely nothing in mind with regard to disrupting air traffic across Europe ... But once it became clear that those disruptive effects are substantial and there's no downside to Russia for doing it, then there's no reason why they shouldn't expand.""

This nuisance approach may not sound alarming for European security, but at the very least it suggests that Russia feels no constraints against performing any disruption of which it is capable.

And the disruption goes well beyond nuisance.

Soviet operatives and their proxies would typically target network industries such as electric cables, power stations, pipelines, transport and telecommunications, Daniela Richterova, a senior lecturer in Intelligence Studies at the War Studies Department of King's College London, told Al Jazeera.

That is precisely the kind of infrastructure that has reportedly been attacked.

""We're seeing this happen at a time of escalation. That was a key part of [Soviet] doctrine, that sabotage operations were meant to be used also in a time of peace if necessary, but especially in times of war, and they were meant to undermine the enemy's resolve, power and war effort.""

The use of proxies is also a telltale sign, she said.

Last month, Germany arrested two dual nationals on suspicion of plotting to plant explosives at US military facilities in Bavaria. The UK has arrested several people this year on similar suspicions. The people arrested are not considered to be members of the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), which typically plans sabotage operations.

The GRU is also suspected of acting directly.

In early May, NATO said GRU had launched cyberattacks against critical infrastructure in Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden. All of them, along with Finland and Estonia, are among the Nordic group of countries that comprise Russia's most vocal critics and Ukraine's most dedicated allies in Europe. The GRU is also believed to field 20 to 40 operations officers, said experts.

Russian government officials generally do not comment on their own covert operations, but on Tuesday Putin reciprocated Western accusations to mark the anniversary of the FSB, Russia's Federal Security Service, whose duties include guarding the borders.

""Largely due to the resolve of the border security troops, numerous attempts to break into the Russian territory by mercenaries, traitors and enemy sabotage groups have been thwarted,"" said Putin, referring to incursions on Russian territory by anti-Putin Russian militias operating from Ukrainian soil.

""Those who planned these terrorist raids on our land have miscalculated and were met with a harsh and brutal rebuff,"" said Putin in a video address.

Russia's ultimate aim is military advantage, said Fitsanakis.

""Currently the Russian sabotage campaign appears to be aimed primarily at disrupting the military supply chain from the West to Ukraine.""

That means stopping the flow of weapons, or destroying the weapons themselves, and Russia's attempts to do so go back a decade. Last month, Czech police said the detonation of 63 tonnes of ordnance intended for Ukraine at a warehouse in Vrbetice in October 2014 was the work of GRU.

Front-line states Poland and Romania, from whose borders all war materiel enters Ukraine, are at obvious risk, said Fitsanakis, but earlier stages in the supply chain are equally critical. That includes Norwegian logistics facilities, ports on the US eastern seaboard, and military instructors in Darwin, Australia.

""A typical example is the port of Alexandroupolis in Greece, which the US Department of Defense credits as providing Washington with 'strategic access' to its Ukrainian ally,"" said Fitsanakis. ""Until recently, the port in this small northern Greek city was far removed from the epicentre of global geopolitics. As a result, security had to be elevated drastically within weeks.""

In addition to military targets, Fitsanakis added, ""Their skills are evolving with an eye to intensification, in case of an all-out war with NATO.""

In that case, sabotage operations would spread to the full gamut of network industries, aiming to shut down travel, power and telecommunications overnight, sending civilian society back to the 19th century and creating political pressure on governments to sue for peace - what Fitsanakis calls, ""mass-scale psychological objectives"".

Early this year, a series of NATO military chiefs publicly warned that the latest intelligence suggested a Russia-NATO war in the next five to eight years was more likely than had previously been thought, and European militaries should prepare accordingly.

EU governments have stepped up long-term contracts to defence industries since January, but it is more difficult to provide security over sprawling infrastructure.

The prime example of this is the North Sea, said Christian Bueger, a professor of Maritime Security at the University of Copenhagen.

""The North Sea today is just a dense industrialised infrastructure environment where there's multiple points of failure,"" he told Al Jazeera.

It's not just the pipelines, data and electricity cables that criss-cross the shallow sea floor, which have already come under suspected attack - most recently when a Russian-operated Chinese merchant vessel dragged its anchors on the sea floor, rupturing the Baltic Connector gas pipeline and telecoms cables between Estonia and Finland last October.

""We are also talking about a lot of emerging infrastructure,"" Bueger said. ""In many ways, the future of the green energy transition hangs on what we can do in the North Sea.""

That includes future offshore wind parks, hydrogen pipelines, and disused oilfields that are intended for carbon storage.

""We haven't even started to consider what the security implication of carbon storage will be,"" Bueger said.

Compared with protection, disruption is frighteningly easy. ""You don't need a submarine,"" said Bueger. ""Most of the time it will be easier to do it from the surface to hide in the official traffic ... you can do it with divers, you can do it with anchors ... you can also potentially do it with submersibles and autonomous vessels.""

NATO has started a subsea infrastructure protection centre.

France and Italy are co-ordinating on a system of marine sensors. The Royal Navy is acquiring an underwater surveillance vessel. But the biggest problem is jurisdictional, said Bueger, who is involved in several transnational projects to build information-sharing protocols across the military, coastguard, law enforcement and shipping industry in EU NATO countries.

""There's been a complete and abject failure by Western leaderships to explain to their electorates just what is at stake,"" said Chatham House's Giles.

""It's telling that the primary instinct from a lot of people seems to be, 'What other defensive measures can we take?' that are going to make life more expensive and inconvenient across Europe,"" he said. ""It's all defensive, it's all reactive. There's nothing apparently being suggested to deal with the root of the problem, which lies in Moscow.""

There are plenty of self-imposed constraints Europe could do away with to push back against Russia. Ukraine has pleaded with Germany to provide long-range Taurus missiles to attack Russian infrastructure - something Germany resists for fear of provoking a nuclear attack.

A growing chorus of legal experts says Europe may confiscate 210 billion euros ($228bn) in EU-held Russian central bank assets. France's President Emmanuel Macron has raised the prospect of sending NATO troops to man Ukraine's rear, and Estonia's Kaja Kallas says some have already done so. Nordic and Baltic countries fearing attack are already putting their economies on a partial war footing, but Germany finds itself unable to overcome legal constraints to spend more on the military.

Giles said all this allows Russia to steal a march on Europe, ""[Russia's] idea of how much you can do without precipitating conflict has been precipitated by Western countries not setting boundaries.""

""The fact that there's no downside is the defining factor of how Russia has seen sub-threshold operations over the last decade.""",aljazeera.com,news,Al Jazeera Online,John T Psaropoulos,0.07450980392156858,454674344,1,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2018-11-02T160626Z_951838612_RC191D3F4740_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-RUSSIA-PUTIN-1716974507.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,eng-9600352

Under the draft proposal, the transaction limit is VNĐ20 million (US$785) per customer per day and the limit for an agent is VNĐ200 million per day and VNĐ5 billion per month.

VCCI said that these limits are no longer appropriate to a modern economy and may cause disruption in the provision of services.

Specifically, VCCI pointed out that these limits have been applied since 2012, when the State Bank of Việt Nam approved the pilot implementation of payment agents.

After 12 years, the limits should be adjusted, taking into account the development of the market, increasing payment demand and the inflation rate, it said.

The VCCI added that restrictions should be adjusted based on the transaction demands in each local area where the agents operate, the scale of operations and their levels of risk.

It urged the State Bank of Việt Nam to amend the circular towards applying limits on new agents only. After that, banks and their business partners can renegotiate for appropriate transaction limits.

The current fees of banks on payment transactions are low, around 0.025-0.04 per cent. Under the draft, payment agents are allowed to collect fees not exceeding those of banks, meaning that agents can earn only VNĐ50,000 - VNĐ80,000 per day with the daily transaction limit of VNĐ200 million, which is too low to attract business partners.

The Chamber argued that there should be policies to encourage financial institutions' business partners to open payment agents in rural, mountainous, remote, border and island areas of Việt Nam, to promote financial inclusion.

According to a survey of 124 central banks around the world by the State Bank of Việt Nam, 105 of them allow payment agents.

A pilot introducing payment agents started in 2014, the aim of bringing financial services to people who might not be able to easily access a bank and ended in 2023 due to not having a legal framework.

Asia Pacific dialogue discusses new trends, challenges in financial industry

Sustainable finance, ESG integration, digital transformation in the financial industry and regulatory developments were the main topics of discussion at the ACCA Asia Pacific Dialogue held by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) in Hanoi on May 28.

The event gathered policymakers, industry experts, and high-profile speakers to engage in critical discussions shaping the future of finance and business in the Asia Pacific region.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chief Executive of ACCA Helen Brand OBE highlighted the Asia Pacific region as a dynamic, strategically vital hub - a bridge and a link between established powers and rapidly emerging players.

""I know we will hear much more discussion on these agendas across the ACCA Asia Pacific Dialogue 2024. This landmark event gives us a unique and powerful platform to exchange knowledge and foster regional collaboration. By uniting leaders from across the region, this event aims to spark thought-provoking conversations and cultivate valuable networking opportunities that will help to shape the future of economic growth and the accounting and finance profession across Asia Pacific,"" said Brand.

Deputy Minister of Finance Vo Thanh Hung emphasised that in recent years, along with the process of innovation and international integration, the Vietnamese economy has developed strongly and is currently in the world's 40 leading economies, in the world's top 20 countries attracting foreign investment and the world's top 20 leading countries in terms of import-export turnover.

""We understand that building a solid foundation for economic co-operation and sustainable development requires consensus and common efforts from countries in the region. In the current context, co-operation in research and development of innovative financial solutions will help solve common challenges that countries in the region face and promote sustainable economic development,"" said Hung.

""Therefore, I believe that promoting co-operation between countries in the fields of finance, accounting and auditing not only improves financial management efficiency, shares resources and promotes high quality human resource training but also creates favourable conditions for sustainable economic development,"" said Hung.

Hưng also suggested to complete the legal framework and improve human resource capacity in accounting and auditing on the basis of international practices is an essential requirement in the economic integration and development process of each country.

""It is necessary to develop training programmes that meet international standards and practical needs of the labour market, ensuring that practising accountants and auditors are equipped with the necessary professional knowledge and practical skills. At the same time, it is necessary to encourage co-operation between training institutions, businesses and international organizations to share experiences and learn advanced training methods,"" added the MoF vice minister.

During the two-day event, participants will focus discussion on various topics, including sustainable finance, ESG integration, digital transformation in finance, regulatory trends and compliance; and the future of work in finance.

The Asia Pacific region is witnessing significant shifts driven by economic growth, technological innovation, and sustainability initiatives. The ACCA Asia Pacific Dialogue will delve into these trends, offering a comprehensive understanding of how they impact the finance sector and beyond.

Discussions will cover the rise of green finance, the impact of AI and automation, and the importance of ethical leadership in fostering a resilient and inclusive economy.

The forum also is an opportunity for speakers to address key issues and opportunities, providing invaluable perspectives on navigating the evolving business landscape.

The ACCA Asia Pacific Dialogue aims to foster a platform for innovative thinking and strategic dialogue among key stakeholders in the accounting and finance sector.

Pulkit Abrol, ACCA Asia Pacific Director, said, ""The ACCA Asia Pacific Dialogue provides an unparalleled opportunity for the business and finance community in our region to come together, share knowledge, and explore innovative solutions to contemporary challenges. By facilitating these crucial discussions, we aim to empower professionals to drive positive change, enhance sustainability, and embrace digital transformation, ultimately contributing to the growth of the Asia Pacific economy.""

Tall Building Forum discusses future of urban living

The European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam (EuroCham Vietnam) and its Construction Sector Committee hosted the inaugural Tall Building Forum on May 28 in Ho Chi Minh City as part of efforts to explore the future of urban living.

The event was supported by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, brought together stakeholders from the construction industry and Government, as well as policymakers who were keen to discuss the challenges and opportunities of sustainable urban development in Vietnam.

The country's rapidly growing cities face a critical challenge of balancing rapid growth with environmental stewardship. The Tall Building Forum confronted this challenge head-on, fostering a vibrant dialogue focusing on technologies and strategies aimed at ensuring that Vietnamese urban expansion is not only robust but also responsible.

In his opening address, Dominik Meichle, chairman of EuroCham Vietnam, championed international collaboration as a cornerstone to achieving these goals. ""This forum represents a unique opportunity for Vietnam and Team Europe to come together to reimagine our cities. By working together, we can construct urban environments that are not only more impressive, but also more environmentally conscious,"" he said.

This sentiment was echoed by Michel Cassagnes, chairman of EuroCham's Construction Sector Committee, who emphasised the shared responsibility for sustainable development, noting, ""The future of our cities depends on our collective commitment to building smarter, not just bigger.""

He went on to praise the forum for paving the way for ""approaches that benefit both our economies and our environment.""

He pointed out that numerous Government and industry leaders, including from The Global City, had enriched the discussion with their insights on cutting-edge technologies, sustainable building materials, and innovative design strategies. They largely concentrated on tackling pressing issues such as integrating high-rise buildings into existing urban landscapes, ensuring affordability and inclusivity, and minimising the environmental impact of tall buildings.

The commitment to sustainable urban development extends beyond the nation's borders. In addition, EuroCham Cambodia will carry this momentum forward by hosting the 2024 edition of its established forum in Phnom Penh on 30 May, underlining the European business community's ongoing dedication to responsible growth and innovation across Southeast Asia, he added.

Meanwhile, Martin Brisson, executive director of EuroCham Cambodia, expressed enthusiasm for the upcoming forum, stating that ""We are excited to host the Tall Building Forum once again, this time with our partners at EuroCham Vietnam. We will explore the importance of sustainability in modern construction, the regulatory environment for tall buildings, and the prospect of affordable tall buildings in the future.""

""We are also proud to be showcasing some of the finest work of Cambodia's architectural students, who will display their designs at the forum as part of the Tall Building Design Competition,"" he stressed.

Hai Phong focuses on digital transformation in logistics

The fifth regional logistics forum, held in the northern port city of Hai Phong on May 28, addressed the crucial role of digital transformation in propelling growth of the Red River Delta's logistics sector.

The event was co-hosted by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), the municipal People's Committee, the Department of Industry and Trade, the Business Forum magazine, the Vietnam Logistics Business Association (VLA), and the Hai Phong Logistics Association (HPLA).

VCCI President Pham Tan Cong highlighted the forum's national reach, noting its successful iterations across the Red River Delta, Southeast Vietnam, and the Mekong Delta. He emphasised the interest from policymakers, industry experts, and logistics players across the country.

Discussions at the event focused on identifying trends and challenges in digitalising logistics, exploring international best practices and analysing Vietnam's existing policies and mechanisms to support this transformation.

Nguyen Duc Tho, Vice Chairman of the municipal People's Committee, pointed out that Hai Phong, with its 1,000 strong logistics companies, has the potential to become a digital hub, not just for itself, but for the entire Red River Delta's economy.

The city's master plan outlines an ambitious expansion of its logistics network, aiming to reach 1,700-2,000 hectares by 2030 and further expand to 2,200-2,500 hectares by 2040.

National and regional strategies further emphasise the importance of digital transformation in logistics. The National Digital Transformation Programme prioritises logistics as one of eight key sectors, while the Ministry of Industry and Trade's Vietnam logistics service development strategy serves as a guiding light for businesses.

For the Red River Delta specifically, the Politburo's recent resolution targets developing Hai Phong and Quang Ninh into major maritime economic hubs by 2045, highlighting the crucial role of a robust and modern logistics sector./.

CT Group pitches hi-tech, sustainable projects to Binh Duong

CT Group, a leading Vietnamese multi-industry conglomerate, presented potential cooperation areas in the southern province of Binh Duong during a working session with Chairman of its People's Committee Vo Van Minh on May 28.

CT Group Chairman Tran Kim Chung highlighted the group's established track record, noting its foundation in 1992 and current presence in 12 countries through 62 member companies. He said it has built a reputation across 11 key sectors, including smart green urban development, infrastructure, environment, logistics, clean food and healthcare, artificial intelligence, drone, genetic and cellular technologies, renewable energy, quantum technology and semiconductor.

Chung outlined several specific projects CT Group envisions undertaking in Binh Duong. These initiatives include training and disseminating methods for automated greenhouse gas inventory, promoting and facilitating carbon credit trading, constructing hi-tech smart industrial parks for semiconductor manufacturing, and developing smart urban areas along major transportation routes.

Chairman Minh expressed his support for CT Group's proposals and committed to working closely with relevant departments and agencies to thoroughly discuss the projects in detail. He noted Binh Duong's ongoing transformation of several smaller industrial zones in Di An city into hi-tech hubs, creating a welcoming environment for CT Group's ventures.

Binh Duong wishes to draw more strategic investors, especially in the hi-tech sector, to enhance added value and propel sustainable development, he said, adding that CT Group's projects align with the local socio-economic development strategy and the province will offer all possible support to them.

The guest further expressed his interest in collaborating with local universities and research institutes to develop relevant training courses.

Binh Duong has emerged as a major industrial hub in Vietnam, attracting nearly 41 billion USD in foreign direct investment, according to the provincial People's Committee./.

Ben Tre's clam farming re-certified Marine Stewardship Council Standard

The clam farming sector of the Mekong Delta province of Ben Tre has received Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification, marking the third time it has met the organisation's sustainability and management standards, Director of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Doan Van Danh announced on May 28.

The certificate will be valid from May 23, 2024 to May 22, 2029. The MSC Fisheries Standard is used to assess if a fishery is well-managed and sustainable.

Earlier, the local clam farming sector received the MSC certificate in 2009 and 2016.

According to the department, being re-certified by the MSC is an advantage for Ben Tre to expand its consumption markets, and create community consensus on the sustainable development of the province's clam exploitation and management in the coming time.

It also shows great efforts and consensus of the communities of the three coastal districts of Ba Tri, Binh Dai and Thanh Phu in jointly exploiting and managing the clam farming sector.

In June, the department will hold a conference to award MSC certificates to seven cooperatives in the province, and introduce MSC-certified clam raw material areas to processing enterprises, said Danh./.

Deputy PM directs Ministry of Construction to coordinate and oversee social housing policy

Deputy Prime Minister Trần Hồng Hà has asked the Ministry of Construction to coordinate and oversee social housing projects.

Deputy Prime Minister Hà requested that the ministry take on a supervisory role in social housing, while compiling the draft of a decree on management and development of social housing held in Hà Nội on May 27.

Deputy PM Hà also asked the MoC to simplify the criteria for determining who should be allocated social housing, as well as conditions on renting and buying social housing.

At the meeting, Hà stated that the development of the decrees detailing implementation of the Land Law 2024, the Housing Law 2023 and the Real Estate Business Law 2023 are important for the public, businesses and state management agencies.

So, the Ministry of Construction needs to coordinate with the Ministry of Finance and the State Bank to study the mechanism for mobilising and using resources for social housing, for engaging with commercial housing project investors and to be the lead in looking at possible funding from commercial banks, who could give preferential credit packages for social housing, he said.

The decree needs to have planning and policies for the long term, to arrange land funds for both urban and rural areas and decide how allocate the State budget combined with other financial sources for social housing projects.

In addition, the Ministry of Construction should clarify who qualifies for social housing, set ways to encourage private investment in social housing projects and determine how social housing is inspected.

The Deputy Prime Minister also asked for regulations to ensure the rights of ethnic minorities and people in remote areas in terms of social housing, along with ensuring that there are regulations on social housing investment projects for the armed forces.

MoC reports that the draft of this decree will have detailed guidance on 18 contents of the 2023 Housing Law related to social housing policies.

At the meeting, Vice Chairman of Quảng Bình Provincial People's Committee Phan Phong Phú proposed adding regulations to encourage commercial housing investors to build social housing from the allocated land fund, instead of paying money into the budget.

Other ideas were to clarify the preferential credit policies, State management agencies' appraisal responsibilities for the social housing construction obligations of commercial housing project investors and arrange land funds in industrial parks to build workforce housing.

FDI reaches US$11.07 billion in first five months of 2024

Foreign direct investment (FDI) into Việt Nam during the first five months of the year has reached US$11.07 billion, a 2 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2023, according to data from the Foreign Investment Agency under the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI).

Project actualisation among FDI projects was estimated at around $8.25 billion, a 7.8 per cent increase year-on-year.

By May 20, the Southeast Asian country hosted 40,285 projects with a total registered capital of $481.33 billion and a project actualisation of $305.43 billion, or 63.5 per cent of the total registered investment capital.

The FDI sector posted a trade surplus of $19.57 billion, including crude oil, and a trade surplus of $18.52 billion, excluding crude oil. Meanwhile, the domestic sector recorded a trade deficit of over $11.05 billion in the same period.

In terms of capital, manufacturing and processing led the pack with investment capital of over $7.43 billion, or 67.1 per cent of the sector's total investment, an increase of 11.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.

The property sector ranked second with a total investment of nearly $1.98 billion, or nearly 17.9 per cent of total registered capital, and an increase of 70.8 per cent year-on-year. Following were wholesale, retail, transportation and warehousing, with a total registered capital of over $856.4 million.

In terms of quantity, the manufacturing and processing industry led in the number of new projects with 35.9 per cent of all new projects, as well as capital adjustment, with 62.3 per cent of all projects. Meanwhile, wholesale and retail led in the number of capital contributions and shares purchased, at 43.4 per cent.

Singapore ranked first among 78 countries and territories with investment in Việt Nam during the period with nearly $3.25 billion, or 29.3 per cent of total FDI, up from 28.2 per cent in the same period last year. Hong Kong (China) ranked second with nearly $1.45 billion, accounting for 13.1 per cent and an increase of 220 per cent compared to last year.

Việt Nam's three other largest investors were China, Japan and South Korea, with China leading in the number of new investment projects with 28.3 per cent.

Positive outlook for VN's steel industry in 2024: Major companies set for recovery, small businesses face output challenges

The steel industry in Việt Nam is expected to have a positive outlook for 2024, with major companies like Hoà Phát and Hoa Sen projected to experience significant recoveries, while small businesses may face challenges in finding output due to the recovery of steel prices and demand from large contractors.

According to Tiên Phong Securities (TPS), the outlook for the steel industry to the end of 2024 is largely positive. The domestic economy is showing signs of improvement, with construction projects resuming, feeding into a more vibrant steel consumption market after the Lunar New Year holiday.

Steel enterprises have seen smooth progress in the first quarter of this year. However, the consumption of construction steel in Việt Nam experienced a 20 per cent decline compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year, mainly due to weak demand from the real estate market.

Financial reports from steel industry enterprises in the first quarter of 2024 indicate improved business results after a volatile period. TPS estimates that the revenue of steel industry enterprises increased by 22 per cent to VNĐ68.8 trillion compared to the same period last year. Net profit also saw a significant increase of 571 per cent to VNĐ3.3 trillion. These positive results can be attributed to the strong growth in finished steel exports and stable input material prices.

Hoà Phát Group (HPG) continues to dominate the steel industry, contributing 88 per cent to the industry's after-tax profit ratio. HPG holds the largest market share in construction steel and steel pipe consumption, with 37.31 per cent and 24.59 per cent respectively. The success of HPG can be attributed to its hot rolled steel coil, which is in demand across various manufacturing industries. This product's market risk is relatively lower as it is not heavily dependent on specific consumer markets.

Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, TPS believes the overall picture is positive but there will be differentiation. Factors such as investments from the State budget, including large projects like the North-South Expressway and Long Thành airport, as well as continued demand from the real estate industry, will drive business prospects.

Large enterprises like Hoà Phát Group and Hoa Sen Group are expected to experience significant recoveries, while small businesses may struggle to find output.

In spite of the buoyant business environment, the valuation of steel stocks are currently relatively high compared to the industry average. The P/E ratio for the steel group is at 23.1, which is higher than the previous three years. Stocks of prominent companies like Hoà Phát Group, Nam Kim Group and Hoa Sen Group have shown strong fundamentals, due to improved sales, better productivity and increased exports of finished steel products.

While the overall outlook for 2024 is positive, experts warn that caution should be exercised in terms of valuation, as steel stocks are currently trading at relatively high levels compared to their historical averages.

Pangasius exports show signs of recovery

Statistics from Việt Nam Customs show that pangasius export turnover in the first five months of this year is estimated at US$725 million, up 2 per cent over the same period last year.

According to the Việt Nam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP), the largest import market for Vietnamese pangasius currently is the US, followed by China, Europe and some South American markets.

The US is currently increasing imports of processed pangasius products, with value added 8.5 times compared to the same period last year.

Frozen pangasius fillets are still the main product of pangasius exports to the US. By the end of May, exports of frozen pangasius fillets to the US reached more than $120 million, up 19 per cent over the same period last year, accounting for 98 per cent of the total value of pangasius exports to the US.

Trương Đình Hòe, general secretary of the VASEP, said that consumers in the US are having higher demand for white fish products, especially pangasius from Việt Nam. Recently, a large number of Vietnamese businesses participated and introduced Vietnamese pangasius products at the North American Seafood Exhibition.

The advantage of Vietnamese pangasius is that it is delicious and suitable for a variety of preparation methods for American consumers such as fish sticks or fish burgers, he said.

In addition, the fact that white meat fish supplies to the US market are decreasing is also a positive sign for Vietnamese pangasius exports to the market.

""The US is considering recognising Việt Nam as a market economy, which has brought optimistic hope to many Vietnamese economic sectors, including the fisheries industry. It is expected that in July, the US will decide whether to recognise Việt Nam as a market economy or not. If Việt Nam's economy is recognised, this will be an advantage for Vietnamese businesses for eliminating or reducing anti-dumping taxes on seafood products,"" Hòe said.

In the European market, pangasius export turnover to this market in the first five months of this year is estimated at $70 million, down 7 per cent compared to the same period last year because this market only became vibrant again since April.

Thu Hằng, an expert from VASEP, said that Germany has surpassed the Netherlands to become the largest pangasius import market in Europe.

VASEP also recorded growth in many European markets in Vietnamese pangasius imports, including Lithuania increasing by 215 per cent, Spain up by 69 per cent, Belgium up 62 per cent and Greece up 46 per cent.

The European market is receiving more attention because demand for white meat fish is on the rise. In addition to focusing on products with high added value, businesses need to focus on fulfilling the market's requirements, as well as on promotion and marketing.

Vietnamese seafood exports to Europe, including pangasius, will be affected by the global economy. Vietnamese export enterprises need to take full advantage of the incentives and advantages that the Việt Nam-Europe Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) bring to participate more deeply in the European market.

Meeting the green standards of this market bloc on environmental protection and sustainable development is also crucial.

VASEP forecasts that Việt Nam's pangasius export prices will increase by 10 per cent in the third quarter of this year, due to a combination of fuel factors, logistics costs and bank interest rates decreases. This is an opportunity for the entire Vietnamese pangasius industry.

DPPA streamlining closer to acceptance

The business community has asked for relaxed regulations for large customers to be able to buy and sell electricity directly.

The latest draft direct power purchase agreement (DPPA) mechanism, set to be submitted to the government this week, outlines the two models of using private transmission lines or using the national grid.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade is pushing rooftop solar for self-consumption. Specifically, the draft on the DPPA mechanism stipulates that organisations and individuals using electricity produced from the 22kV voltage level, with an average monthly consumption of 500,000kWh, can participate.

Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha has asked for clarity on the appropriateness of regulations on customers with average monthly consumption of 500,000kWh. At the same time, there must be consideration on having a capacity limit between manufacturers and commercial services to ensure the rights and obligations of parties participating in the mechanism; and policies to encourage businesses to consume renewable energy to receive green credits.

A Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) report published last week suggested that with direct electricity trading through private lines, the impact on the national electricity system is negligible, and so it should be expanded to all customers.

""The draft stipulates that customers who buy electricity directly must invest in grid infrastructure and have a team to manage and operate the grid. It should be left to the two parties to negotiate,"" the report said.

Ngo Duc Lam, former deputy director of the Institute of Energy under the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), said that there are two details related to the application subjects that need attention.

""We should expand the subjects allowed to buy and sell electricity directly by lowering customers' monthly electricity consumption, and we should not give specific figures on electricity consumption output to apply to this mechanism,"" Lam said.

To encourage businesses to use more renewable electricity and to reach the goal of reducing net emissions, there needs to be a longer-term electricity trading mechanism, he added.

""Because in general, to have a truly competitive electricity market, it must still be open to those participating in direct electricity trading, regardless of whether customers are large or small,"" he said.

DPM Ha stated in a meeting on May 14 that although the National Power Development Plan, the Law on Electricity, and other relevant documents all call for the creation of a competitive electricity market, the implementation has been far too sluggish because of the technical issues raised in the draft mechanism.

Conditions are more flexible now that certain previous requirements have been removed and specific criteria for choosing parties to take part in the pilot programme have been provided in the MoIT's draft, Ha said.

Many investors, international organisations, and electricity customers have expressed interest in participating in the DPPA mechanism and hope that the government will soon issue the mechanism to help achieve sustainable development goals.

Samsung, Apple, Heineken, and Meta have all sent letters to the prime minister and the MoIT to show support for the DPPA mechanism, the ministry said.

The MoIT also said in its impact assessment report of the DPPA mechanism that 24 renewable energy projects with an installed capacity of more than 1,770MW want to participate. Some 17 projects with capacity at 2,835MW are considering participation conditions, and 26 projects responded that they did not want to participate.

DPM Ha also requested that it be necessary to clearly define the responsibilities of the MoIT, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and Vietnam Electricity on certification procedures and publicising information about businesses consuming clean and green electric energy to be granted credit.

Industrial park investors are also major customers, and the customer base must be expanded to include service providers and not simply manufacturers, Ha added.

Vietnam well-placed to remain strategic M&A leader

SCGJWD Logistics (SJWD), the logistics arm under Siam Cement Group (SCG), in early May announced that it is purchasing SCG International Vietnam Co., Ltd. (SCG Inter VN) for approximately $5.4 million.

The deal marks SJWD's expansion in Vietnam's fast-growing logistics industry. The company's agreement to enter into the contract is set for this month. The expected closing date for the transaction is in June.

SCG Inter VN is a third-party logistics provider with over 10 years of experience in the logistics industry. It has established a network of service providers specialising in truck and container transport, offering logistics services across Vietnam and facilitating cross-border freight transport in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and China, as well as being an expert in warehouse management.

SCG Inter VN also offers logistics services for the Long Son Petrochemicals complex in Vietnam, which is operated by SCG Chemicals, the chemical arm of SCG.

""We expect to start recognising revenues from SCG Inter VN in the third quarter of 2024,"" Eakaponng Tungsrisanguan, CFO of SJWD, told Bangkok Post.

Meanwhile, Japan's Mitsubishi Materials Corporation Group (MMC Group) also reached a framework agreement with Masan High-Tech Materials to acquire H.C. Starck Holding (HCS).

MMC Group's potential acquisition of HCS plays to its strengths in the mid-stream and down-stream tungsten value chain. The acquisition will provide MMC Group with access to HCS' production hubs in Europe, North America and China as well as a comprehensive tungsten scrap recycling platform backed by proprietary intellectual property including 90 worldwide patents and another 53 patents in the application phase.

Meanwhile, the sale of HCS to MMC Group will help Masan High-Tech to focus on optimising its domestic operations. This agreement marks the next step in both parties' business cooperation.

Vo Ha Duyen, chairperson of law firm VILAF, told VIR that challenges in the financial markets are likely to persist across certain domestic sectors in 2024 as investors grapple with the evolving global and domestic political and regulatory landscapes.

Despite this, the country will likely remain a key growth leader in Southeast Asia, largely thanks to the effective free trade agreements boosting its export industries.

""For 2024 and 2025, Vietnam is probably expected to experience robust merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in healthcare, financial services, and digital infrastructure. This growth is likely driven by an ageing population, heightened health awareness, and technological advancements such as fintech and digital banking,"" Duyen said.

Additionally, the recent relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions in data centres and telecom services will further stimulate this trend. From an external perspective, the US Federal Trade Commission's increased scrutiny of M&A transactions in the US may redirect more investors towards Asia, including Vietnam, Duyen added.

The energy sector likely also holds potential for M&A activities in Asia. However, Vietnam would need to accelerate the development of its legal framework surrounding energy investments to fully capitalise on this opportunity and rejuvenate investment flows within the sector, she added.

According to data by the General Statistics Office, foreign investors injected $929.6 million into 902 capital contribution and share purchase deals in January-April. For the form of capital contribution and share purchase by foreign investors, capital invested in transportation and warehousing activities reached $277.2 million, accounting for 29.8 per cent of the value of capital contribution.

The figure for sci-tech and professional activities stood at $228.7 million, accounting for 24.6 per cent. The remaining industry has $423.7 million, making up for 45.6 per cent.

Masataka ""Sam"" Yoshida, head of the Cross-border Division of RECOF Corporation, is also upbeat about the outlook of Vietnam's M&A market. The company forecasts a stable but stronger growth of Japanese investments not only in the number of transactions but also in the transaction size, backed up with the increase in valuation of Vietnamese companies which have added value in their financial performances.

""The presence of Japanese investors may bring a new dimension of competition to the Vietnamese market, not just for local companies but also for foreign investors from Thailand, South Korea, and Singapore,"" Yoshida said.

The strategic, long-term investment approach of Japanese firms, coupled with their technology and operational efficiency, sets a high benchmark for value creation and sustainable growth, he added.

""This not only challenges existing players to elevate their game to higher levels but also offers Vietnamese companies opportunities for technological and managerial enhancement.""

Ca Mau to invest VND20 trillion to boost shrimp industry

The Mekong Delta province of Ca Mau plans to invest VND20 trillion to develop its shrimp industry, aiming to increase export revenue to US$1.4 billion by 2025 and US$1.65 billion by 2030.

The People's Committee of Ca Mau Province said on May 25 that it had approved a development plan for the shrimp sector in 2021-2030, with a vision to 2050.

Under this plan, the province will use advanced technology to enhance productivity and quality, making local shrimp competitive in global markets. The plan also addresses climate change and environmental protection.

Ca Mau aims to produce 176,000 tons of processed seafood by 2030, and establish two seafood complexes in Nam Can and Dam Doi districts, covering 190 hectares and 178 hectares, respectively. These complexes will provide housing and logistics for workers and experts.

The plan also focuses on shifting production towards value-added products, targeting 75-80% of exports in this category by 2030, while reducing the share of raw exports to 20-25%.

Ca Mau looks to maintain strong export markets while expanding to new ones. By 2030, it projects the EU will account for 17% of exports, Japan 20%, the U.S. 20%, and China and others 43%.

Vietnam is one of the world's largest shrimp producers, with Ca Mau as its leading shrimp farming province. The province has 280,000 hectares under shrimp farming, part of its 303,000 hectares of aquaculture land. The shrimp industry contributes nearly 50% of Vietnam's seafood export value, generating close to US$4 billion annually.

HCMC public capital disbursement remains slow

HCMC had disbursed over VND6.55 trillion of public investment capital as of mid-May, reaching just 8.3% of its 2024 plan, according to official statistics.

The plan for disbursing allocated capital this year is VND79.264 trillion. However, 925 projects worth VND16.4 trillion, or 21% of the allocated funds, have yet to see any disbursement, reported the State Treasury in HCMC.

Bui Nhat Toan, deputy director of the State Treasury in HCMC, expressed concern over the lower-than-expected disbursement rate, saying that the State Treasury is collaborating with the Department of Finance and the Department of Planning and Investment to advise the HCMC People's Committee on accelerating capital disbursement.

Toan emphasized the need for enhanced efforts among treasury officials to speed up disbursement. This includes strict inspections and urging investors to complete necessary procedures, aiming to achieve a 95% disbursement rate by the end of 2024.

Developers of key projects must submit weekly progress reports. Projects facing delays will be closely monitored, with penalties for contractors found to cause delays.

Municipal departments are urged to support the disbursement effort. This involves speeding up compensation, resettlement support, and site clearance. They must also expedite the relocation of technical infrastructure and streamline project acceptance and payment procedures.

The State Treasury in HCMC recommended empowering task force leaders to resolve project-specific issues swiftly. There is also a call for stringent accountability measures for investors who frequently request project adjustments and extensions.

Online payments for public services soar

The inclination toward online payment for public services is steadily increasing in Vietnam, according to the National Payment Corporation of Vietnam (Napas).

A Napas report shows that in the first quarter of 2024, the number of public service payments processed online increased by 153% and the transaction value increased by 129% compared to the same period last year.

In 2023, these figures increased by 540% in terms of transaction volume and 149% in terms of transaction value compared to 2022. The method of paying for online public services through mobile money accounts will be expanded to increase convenience, simplicity and speed.

To process payments on the National Public Service Portal (dichvucong.gov.vn), the company completed the integration of online payment infrastructure for 63 localities and 21 ministries, departments and public service providers.

Citizens can pay online for a wide range of services, including taxes, land and property registration fees, traffic fines, court costs, voluntary family health insurance and social security premium payments, and individual tax returns and payments.

Napas is actively using the National Public Service Portal and the VNeID app (developed and managed by the Ministry of Public Security), the two online payment channels for public services, to promote Stage 4 online public service payments for citizens.

Napas continues to work with the Ministry of Public Security and relevant units to implement online payment of fees/charges for public services through the VNeID application.

Recently, the Ministry of Public Security piloted online payment of criminal record certificate fees for citizens in Hanoi and Hue City. People can choose to pay with NAPAS cards from 44 banks/financial companies, through bank accounts from seven banks, or with the VietQR code through applications from other 37 banks.

Nguyen Quang Minh, CEO of Napas, said that working with the Government Office, the Ministry of Public Security and related departments to build the payment infrastructure for online public services on the National Public Service Portal and the VNeID application is one of its important tasks.

The introduction of modern, fast and secure online payment options for public services for individuals and businesses has been accelerated thanks to the network of payment infrastructure and resources that are readily available, Minh added.

The CEO hopes that the pilot results will serve as a basis for expanding online payment for more public services. This is in line with the government's goals for national digital transformation and the development of the digital economy, society and digital citizens.

C.bank not considering dropping credit growth quota for fear of rising bad debts

The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) is not expected to abolish the annual credit growth quota mechanism due to concerns that the system may return to the interest rate competition, lending, and high non-performing loans seen before 2011.

In its report to the National Assembly, the SBV stated that starting in 2024, the credit ""leeway"" has been removed for branches of foreign banks. For other credit institutions, the SBV will gradually review and waive these limits, though some challenges remain.

The credit quota refers to the lending growth limits allocated to each bank by the SBV. These limits are calculated based on various inputs, including outstanding credit balances, ranking scores, and the sales of credit balances.

According to the SBV, the biggest challenge is that Vietnam's economy is heavily dependent on bank capital, a situation that has not changed. The pressure to balance capital to the economy continues to weigh on the banking system, posing risks of maturity mismatches and liquidity issues.

""Given the unique economic conditions of Vietnam, if banks increase credit growth without control measures, the system could return to the hot credit growth period seen before 2011,"" the SBV report stated.

The SBV is also concerned that this could lead to an increase in non-performing loans, threaten the safety of the banking system, and pose a risk of macroeconomic instability and inflation.

Therefore, maintaining the credit limit tool is deemed necessary by the SBV. ""Removing this measure needs to be done cautiously, with a clear roadmap, and gradually in accordance with market conditions,"" the SBV said.

However, during a recent discussion session at the National Assembly, Ha Sy Dong, Vice Chairman of Quang Tri Province, suggested that in the long term, the SBV should use interest rate tools to manage credit rather than growth limits.

The SBV also noted that if the credit growth allocation mechanism is abolished, control will be implemented through capital adequacy and operational indicators. To achieve this, the SBV has instructed credit institutions to restructure and handle bad debts and improve governance standards.

Before 2011, the credit-to-GDP ratio increased rapidly, leading to a race in deposit and lending interest rates and a surge in bad debts. Many banks faced liquidity risks, leading to macroeconomic instability.

This year, the SBV already allocated the credit limit to banks at the beginning of the year with a growth target of 15%. This approach differs from previous years when allocations were made in several stages based on banks' applications.

Việt Nam officially joins sustainable aviation fuel club

iệt Nam's recent venture into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) marks a significant milestone not just for Vietnam Airlines (VNA) but for the entire Vietnamese aviation sector.

By completing flight VN660 from Singapore to Hà Nội using SAF, Vietnam Airlines has taken a bold step towards fostering greener practices within the industry.

SAF, derived from renewable and sustainable sources like used cooking oil and waste animal fat, offers a promising avenue for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in aviation. Its ability to meet stringent international aviation standards while significantly curbing emissions throughout its life cycle makes it a compelling alternative to traditional fossil fuels.

SAF's compatibility with existing infrastructure, resilience in various weather conditions, and potential to enhance flight performance underscore its viability as a fuel of the future. As the global aviation community increasingly commits to net zero emissions by 2050, SAF emerges as a pivotal solution in mitigating the industry's environmental footprint.

Việt Nam's dedication to sustainability, as demonstrated through its participation in international climate summits and commitments to achieving net zero emissions, aligns with broader global efforts to combat climate change.

The adoption of SAF by Vietnam Airlines not only exemplifies the nation's commitment to environmental stewardship but also positions it as a proactive player in the global transition towards greener aviation practices.

HSBC Vietnam provides loan to Gemadept

HSBC Bank (Vietnam) Ltd. (HSBC Vietnam) and Gemadept Joint Stock Company (Gemadept) signed a Sustainable Linked Loan agreement yesterday as part of a strategy to access green capital for sustainable development.

This is the next step in logistics company Gemadept's development plans, also serving to reaffirm HSBC Vietnam's role and efforts in supporting Vietnamese businesses to become more sustainable.

Port exploitation and logistics - Gemadept's specialty - are also key for sustainable development, acting as an important bridge in domestic and global trade.

The potential of the industry is highlighted by the continuous growth of imports and exports in recent weeks, demonstrated by a 15.5% increase of total import and export turnover in the first quarter of 2024.

This deal marked the first sustainable linked loan that HSBC successfully arranged for a Vietnamese enterprise in ports and logistics. To achieve this facility, Gemadept has gone through HSBC's credit management and approval process on sustainable finance, as well as building KPIs in its green and sustainable development strategy.

Gemadept will complete measurements of its ports and report on Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, certified by Vinamarine Green Port Standards and set by the Vietnam Marine Division.

This sustainable linked loan marks a new chapter for both organisations' strategic cooperation.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,-0.08235294117647063,454662067,63,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/29/2024-1427.jpg?width=0&s=jVyU2MKLQgbZNFkyQh3b7w,eng-9606711

NATO has upped its ""vigilance"" amid an increase in ""Russian intelligence activity"" across its member countries, the military alliance's secretary-general acknowledged on Tuesday

Asked about recent suspected Russian sabotage and arson attempts targeted at warehouses, shopping centres and households across EU and NATO countries, Stoltenberg refrained from directly pinning responsibility on the Kremlin.

But he clearly indicated the alliance was monitoring the events and underlined the importance of criminal investigations at national level.

""We have seen increased Russian intelligence activity across the alliance, therefore we have increased our vigilance, we have our own services who are closely monitoring what the Russians are doing,"" Stoltenberg - who is due to step down in October after a decade at NATO's helm - said.

""It is important that also nations are taking action (with) the arrests and the legal processes that have now started in the UK, in Germany, in Poland and in other countries,"" he added.

""We need to be ready and we need to share intelligence (...) to counter these different types of hybrid acts aimed at undermining the ability of NATO allies to provide support to Ukraine.""

Over the weekend, a New York Times report citing US and allied security officials claimed some of the recent hybrid attacks - notably attempted arson - in Europe were the work of the GRU, Moscow's military intelligence arm.

The incidents include recent arson attempts on sites across Poland which led to nine individuals being arrested on suspicion of Russian sabotage last Tuesday.

Speaking to Polish broadcaster TVN24 last week, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the suspects - allegedly Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Polish citizens - had ""engaged directly on behalf of the Russian services in acts of sabotage in Poland,"" including physical assault, arson and attempted arson.

Tusk said the attacks included an attempt to set fire to a paint factory in the western Polish city of Wroclaw, as well as other recent incidents in Lithuania, Latvia, and potentially Sweden.

A recent arson at an Ikea warehouse in Lithuania is now suspected of being linked to the Kremlin's operations.

Speaking to local media last Wednesday, Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa also warned of possible Russian operations in the country, noting that ""arson is one of the most typical forms of diversion for Russian special services.""

In April, two German-Russian nationals were arrested in Germany for planning bombings and arson attacks against critical infrastructure and military bases.

Authorities in the United Kingdom, a non-EU member state but a NATO ally, also arrested two men in late April after an arson attempt on a Ukraine-linked business on an industrial estate in east London.

Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU defence ministers in Brussels on Tuesday, the Netherlands' defence minister Kajsa Ollongren also raised the alarm: ""What we're seeing now in several European countries is Russia trying to destabilise us, also to intimidate us.""

""We are aware of this new way of working,"" she added. ""And, so, yes, we are vulnerable. I think all of us are. We have vital infrastructure, we have undersea bed infrastructure, we have electricity supplies, water supplies (...) We are vulnerable but we can also protect ourselves if we cooperate between partners, with industry, and with our security services,"" she added.

This is the kind of daily fluctuation that electricity consumers will have to keep in mind this summer, and according to Eesti Energia's Armen Kasparov, behind it are solar, natural gas and Estlink 2, the undersea power link between Estonia and Finland.

""Peak morning and evening hours are covered by the production of gas-fired power plants which reaches us from Latvia and Lithuania, and their cost price never drops below €100,"" explained Kasparov, head of energy trading at the Estonian state-owned energy group.

""We know that the Estlink 2 cable is out of service until September, and with that, affordable electricity from the Nordic countries, which today comes primarily from nuclear energy, isn't reaching us,"" he continued. ""Midday is peak solar production, and that drives down prices significantly because there's not that much demand to meet. All three of these factors are closely linked.""

Kasparov acknowledged that very cheap solar energy should please consumers, but most people are at work during the day. In the short term, household consumers are protected from fluctuations in market prices by fixed-price plans. In the future, large and high-capacity energy storage facilities would help as well.

""Solar energy isn't bad, it just needs cheaper production capacities on the market, or storage options that could distribute this cheap electricity at later hours too,"" he said. ""But if these capabilities do emerge, it will mean that daytime prices will go up a bit as well, because then that cheap electricity won't be put into the grid; it will be stored for the evening hours.""

Eesti Energia's thermal power plants, meanwhile, cannot even enter the market with such price fluctuations. The group's energy trading chief pointed out that firing up the thermal power plant at Auvere is a very lengthy process.

""Just to produce [electricity] only in the morning and evening, that means that all those daytime deficits, where the price is near zero, need to be factored in,"" he explained. ""This makes oil shale-fired power plants very uncompetitive against gas-fired plants, which are very fast. Consumers aren't willing to pay a daily average price of €150 per MWh right now. That is what Auvere would actually need.""

Oil shale-fired power plants may not return to the market until fall, when there will be less sunlight, electricity consumption will go up and Estlink 2 will be up and running again, which would help avoid more significant price fluctuations.",news.err.ee,news,ERR,Jüri Nikolajev,0.3176470588235294,454593527,26,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/05/28/2415225he160t24.jpg,

At a press conference after a meeting of his European Union counterparts, Péter Szijjártó said ""the countdown"" to the European parliamentary elections ""is unfortunately bringing about an increase in war sentiment"", with many proposing more money and arms for Ukraine, ""which can only result in further destruction and more deaths"".

He referred to proposals aimed at allowing Ukraine to use Western arms against targets in Russia. ""They talk positively about an initiative for NATO countries to shoot down Russian missiles above Ukraine and, unfortunately, my fellow foreign ministers have not distanced themselves from threats of nuclear war,"" he said, adding that such remarks and ""crazy proposals"" could have ""dangerous and tragic consequences"".

""We don't want to see Hungarians at the frontline of the Ukraine-Russia war, and we do not want young Hungarians to be taken to Ukraine. This isn't our war and we have nothing to do with it,"" Szijjártó said.

""We firmly call on all European politicians mulling mandatory conscription to drop such ideas immediately... Hands off our central European and Hungarians young people,"" Szijjártó said.

Regarding the draft of the 14th sanctions package against Russia, Szijjártó said that it was against Hungary's economic interests in its current form and would also endanger the security of Hungary's energy supply. The government was unwilling to vote for it, he added.

He said the measures would swipe a serious blow to Hungary's agriculture and food industry, and could compromise ""the way Hungary pays for"" its electricity, slow down the Paks upgrade project and violate Hungary' sovereignty concerning the issuance of certain export permits.

He insisted that the previous 13 sanctions packages had done ""a lot more harm to Europe than to Russia"".

On another subject, Szijjártó said Hungary was sticking to its earlier position and would not agree to freeing up a further 6.5 billion euros from the European Peace Facility for arms deliveries to Ukraine.

He said the foreign ministers of Germany, Lithuania, Ireland, Poland and other countries had ""ganged up on him"" at the meeting but ""this hasn't shaken our position"". ""No matter how loud Europe's pro-war politicians shout ... we won't give in to pro-war pressure,"" he said.

The wind farm, previously owned by Utilitas Wind, a wind developer in the Baltics, is expected to commence energy production in the first quarter of 2026.

The wind farm will feature 20 6.2MW turbines to be supplied and installed by Vestas. Merko statyba UAB, a construction services provider, is responsible for building the necessary infrastructure, including connection facilities, access roads, cable networks, and turbine foundations.

Utilitas Wind will oversee project management. The total estimated cost for constructing the wind farm is approximately €200m.

Upon completion, the Telšiai wind farm is projected to produce sufficient electricity to power over 125,000 households annually.

Latvenergo management board chairman Mārtiņš Čakste said: ""I am delighted to conclude this international transaction now, as the project is not only very ambitious in terms of the capacity of the farm to be built but it will also give us an advantage in terms of commercial start-up - in less than 24 months we will be able to run modern and efficient green energy facilities that will supply our well-connected domestic market.

""Thanks to the team of Latvenergo and professionals from Utilitas, as well as to our shareholder - the Ministry of Economics - for their support. By promoting energy independence and greening of electricity production, the Lithuanian state is pursuing a very active RES development policy - it is a pleasure to be a part of this policy.""

This development aligns with Latvenergo's objective to expand its renewable energy resources geographically, both within and beyond the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

Utilitas Wind CEO Rene Tammist said: ""We are very pleased to start this cooperation with Latvenergo on this project to get the new significant wind capacity up and running. We have already started the construction works and plan to have the wind farm ready for the production of electricity by the first quarter of 2026.

""The need for new renewable energy capacities is significant across the region. Wind energy has great potential in the Baltic region and is equally important for achieving climate goals and ensuring energy security.""

As the joint initiative just turned two, the European Commission released country reports tracking progress.

Diversifying the EU's energy supplies, speeding up the green transition and improving the bloc's energy security are the goals of the REPowerEU plan which celebrated its two-year anniversary recently.

On Tuesday, EU ministers gave final approval to the electricity market reform - also geared towards improving the bloc's energy security. The reform further promotes the expansion of renewable energies and should better protect consumers from escalating electricity prices in the future.

Two years of REPowerEU

Faced with the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022. The plan foresees energy saving goals, the production of clean energy and the diversification of energy supplies - and ultimately ending the dependency on Russian fossil fuels.

Since the adoption of the REPowerEU plan, the EU has successfully reduced gas supplies from Russia. The share of gas from Russia - by pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) - made up 45 percent of all imported gas in 2021, but only 15 percent in 2023. The Union replaced it with gas from other third countries. Norway and the USA have become the largest gas suppliers.

Seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, refined petroleum products and Russian coal imports have been banned through EU sanctions.

Natural gas consumption: How much did member states reduce?

In 27 country reports released for the two-year anniversary of REPowerEU, the European Commission compiled member states' performances between August 2022 and January 2024. Each country report includes a country-specific analysis on a range of points, for example on the key energy figures, diversification of energy supplies, energy price developments or the natural gas demand reduction.

The EU countries had agreed on a voluntary 15 percent reduction target of natural gas consumption and almost all countries have managed to lower their gas consumption. On EU level, the countries achieved a decrease of 18 percent.

21 countries lowered their gas consumption even further than the agreed-upon reduction target, including Denmark (-40%), Finland (-39%), Latvia (-30%), Sweden (-29%), Lithuania (-29%), Estonia (-28%), the Netherlands (-27%), Luxembourg (-26%), Portugal (-23%), Slovakia (-22%), France (-20%), Romania (-19%), Austria (-19%), Hungary (-18%) and Bulgaria (-18%), Italy (-17%), Croatia (-17%), Czechia (-17%), Greece (-16%), Germany (-16%) and Belgium (-16%).

According to the European Commission's data, only five countries did not meet the 15 percent reduction target. Among those are Spain (-12%), Slovenia (-10%), Poland (-8%), Ireland (-4%) and Malta, the only country which increased its gas consumption by ten percent. According to the report, Cyprus does not use natural gas.

Slovenia: Cutting down on consumption, but still reliant on Russian gas

In the case of Slovenia, the REPowerEU report pointed out that while the country 'has taken measures to strengthen alternative supplies of natural gas', it 'effectively remains reliant on Russian gas imported through Austria'.

Data by the Slovenian Energy Agency shows that in 2023 Slovenia imported 68.3 percent of gas from Austria and 28.3 percent from Algeria, through Italy. The agency cannot say with certainty how much of the gas imported from Austria is of Russian origin.

Even though gas importers have not had direct contracts for supply of gas from Russia for 2023 or 2024, the Energy Agency believes that the share of Russian gas was still predominant both in 2023 and in the first part of 2024.

Moving forward on renewables with room for improvement

The EU and its member states are continuously working towards becoming more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels. What have countries achieved so far?

In 2023, according to the European Commission, Portugal for example installed around 1.3 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity, bringing the total to 18.4 gigawatts - in comparison to 5.1 gigawatts in 2021. Additionally, the annual growth rate of installed renewable energy capacity increased to 7.6 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2021. However, the country's energy mix still included 69 percent fossil fuels in 2022.

Neighbouring Spain accelerated its transition towards a decarbonised energy system. According to Spanish grid operator Red Electrica, renewables accounted for 65.2 percent of the Spanish electricity mix in March - an all-time high. Still, the REPowerEU Spain report states that fossil fuels continue to play a central role in the country's energy system, representing 70.1 percent of primary energy imported in 2021.

Croatia quickly deduced its dependence on Russian gas imports by increasing its own production and intensifying the use of the existing LNG terminal. However, Croatia is still highly dependent on energy imports from countries outside the EU. Fossil fuels also continue to play an important role in Croatia's energy mix, as they accounted for 72 percent of gross available energy in 2022.

Moving into a greener direction, the country could soon start to produce green hydrogen: INA, the leading Croatian oil and gas company, recently signed two contracts related to renewable energy projects - one for the production of green hydrogen and the other for a bio-methane production facility. The completion of the construction of both plants is expected in 2026. The green hydrogen project, together with its solar plant and logistic capacity, will be co-financed via the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

The EU's RRF is a tool providing grants and loans to support reforms and investments in member states. It should, among other things, help member states become more sustainable, boost progress with the green and digital transition and achieve the EU target of climate neutrality by 2050.

...just hang on for a year

In Bulgaria, one of the major national energy reforms has been postponed by a year, which means the artificial maintenance of coal capacity will remain for at least another twelve months. This, in turn, could lead to the country not receiving the expected 1.3 billion BNG (around 665.15 million Euro) under the Bulgarian National Recovery and Resilience Plan which is funded under the EU's RFF. The energy reform is a mandatory requirement.

While Bulgarian MPs justified this citing a lack of readiness to switch from a regulated to a free electricity market or funds, several media outlets and experts attributed the decision mostly to pre-election populism.

A reformed energy market for security and a green future

This week, the electricity market reform took its final hurdle after representatives from EU member states and the European Parliament had signed off on the market reforms last December.

Belgium's Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten described the day as a 'milestone for the EU' on the path to a carbon-free and greener future. 'By adopting the electricity market reform, we are empowering consumers, ensuring security of supply and paving the way for a more stable, predictable and sustainable energy market.'

New long-term contracts between governments and electricity producers, under which the state would chip in if the market price drops below an agreed price, are central to the reform efforts.This is meant to incentivise domestic green and nuclear power production by ensuring a return on investments.

It also protects consumers who, in the future, have the right to both fixed-price contracts and contracts with dynamic prices. This would allow consumers to opt for both secure, long-term prices and contracts with changing prices if they want to take advantage of price fluctuations - for example, to use electricity when it is cheaper for charging electric cars or for heat pumps.

How does the electricity market work?

The electricity market in the EU works according to the merit-order principle, defining the order in which power plants connected to the electricity exchange are used to deliver energy and to determine the market price.

Those that can produce electricity at relatively low marginal cost, like wind farms, are used first to cover demand. But as demand rises beyond those initial sources' capabilities, higher marginal cost sources are used.

The final price therefore depends on which sources need to be used to meet demand, as well as fluctuations in the costs of using those sources. For example, a surge in natural gas prices raises the cost of using gas-fired power plants. (AGERPRES: RO - editors: Mariana Ionescu, Cristina Zaharia)

Finland's defence posture has changed since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, but there are key differences between the Finns' defence plans and those of their Baltic neighbours to the south.

The city centre of Lappeenranta lies only 20 kilometres from Finland's southeastern border with Russia. By car, that journey only takes about 20 minutes, placing the city in a potentially vulnerable position if Finland were to face a military threat from the east.

While the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are building a chain of fortifications along their eastern borders to repel any possible Russian military incursion, Finland has no such plans to militarily reinforce its eastern border.

In Lappeenranta, people are relaxed about that plan.

""Yes, a frontline would form quite quickly if such a situation arose. The Finnish Defence Forces has also made agreements with landowners that fortifications could be built during peacetime,"" said Ari-Pekka Meuronen, the City of Lappeenranta's head of security and risk management.

Lappeenranta updated its contingency plans after Russia invaded Ukraine, but there are currently no indications of an immediate threat.

Evacuation plans have been discussed in recent times, and the Ministry of the Interior published new instructions in January. Updates to the plans are now being made in different parts of Finland.

""We have recently gone through the evacuation plans in detail. They have been refined and made more detailed,"" Meuronen said, adding that evacuation plans used to be broader in scope but they have now been updated at the level of villages and city districts.

Russia has hit power plants and electricity grids in Ukraine, a scenario for which Lappeenranta has made preliminary preparations.

""We have purchased large and small backup power plants and placed them in different parts of the city,"" Meuronen told Yle.

Baltics bolstering borders

Defence strategy and possible evacuations have been hot topics elsewhere on the EU's eastern border, as military defence is becoming an increasingly visible part of EU policy.

The EU has set up a European Defence Fund to support joint defence industrial projects between member states. Proposals for a new defence commissioner post at the EU have also gained traction.

The incoming European Parliament, to be elected in June, will have to make more decisions on EU defence policy.

In the Baltics, preparations aimed at thwarting any potential military attack are under way by building a chain of fortifications on the eastern border -- the Baltic Defence Line. The idea is to stop the enemy immediately at the border and not to let them go deeper into the country.

""This will give time to evacuate the civilian population and get allied reinforcements on the ground,"" explained Lukas Milevski, an associate professor of military policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

Poland also recently announced a major 2.5 billion euro programme for eastern border security, including the construction of fortifications on its eastern border with Belarus.

The importance of the EU's eastern border security was also underlined by the recent visit of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Imatra on Finland's southeastern border.

Finland's defence preparedness

Finland's defensive strategy does not seek to stop the enemy in a fixed line immediately on the border. Instead, it would allow invading forces deeper into the country with a view to Finnish forces responding with a strategy of manoeuvre warfare, which focuses on being able to counterattack with rapid movements.

""The Finnish thinking has been to allow the enemy to advance a little inwards and then beat them back,"" military policy expert Lieutenant Colonel Juhani Pihlajamaa summarised.

In practice, this means that the defence must have depth and terrain on Finland's eastern border where defensive battles would be fought.

Finland's geography of dense forests is also better suited for this strategy than the relatively flat plains of the Baltics.

Separately, an unidentified aircraft was spotted flying along the Finnish-Russian border on the Russian side by the online flight monitoring service Flightradar24 on Thursday afternoon. The flight service showed the route of the plane, taking off and landing at a St Petersburg airport, but was not able to determine whether the plane was private or state-owned.",yle.fi,news,Yle.fi,,-0.05882352941176472,454245191,1,"https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_447,w_4368,h_2457/w_1200,ar_1.91,c_fill/q_auto:eco,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1716545715/39-126866466167fd393f88",

Funded by a €30m loan from SEB Bank a new datacenter in Latvia is under construction to meet the growing demand for datacenter capacities in Europe and worldwide.

What datacenter operations trends do you see globally?

The demand for datacenter services in the Baltics and Europe is rapidly growing. The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine were catalysts - before these events, many businesses didn't give much thought to their IT infrastructure and many still quietly managed their servers in-house.

Undoubtedly, the development of AI and the fast-growing use of IoT devices have contributed to this too. Now industries like manufacturing, agriculture and many others require remote solutions and smart IoT devices, sensors and machines that transmit the large volumes of data they collect and need datacenters to store it. Powering AI models takes a lot of energy. The training process generates an enormous resource drain and requires mind-boggling amounts of capital, time, space, and power to deploy.

Edge computing is becoming more important to speed up data processing, reduce latency and deliver real-time insights to make more efficient use of resources. Regional datacenter providers are required to serve the needs of not only local businesses, but worldwide, and as we have datacenters in Northern Europe we can store relevant data locally, closer to where data is generated and consumed. Cloud solutions are among our top services, and colocation is in the top three.

Customers often come to our group of companies with more complex or individual requests, such as private clouds. DLC has strong data transmission services which help businesses connect their sites and branch offices. Unlike many pure colocation providers, we also provide complimentary managed services. As DEAC and DLC are part of the same group, this collaboration has broadened the service portfolio and strengthened positions in the market.

How many datacenters do you have?

With several datacenters in Latvia and Lithuania and points of presence in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Stockholm, we expand IT infrastructure for companies in the Baltics and beyond. A third 10 MW facility is currently under construction and will offer up to 1000 racks, providing customers with up to 20kW per standard rack and up to 100kW per rack to meet the growing high-performance computing (HPC) and AI demands. In Lithuania, DLC has three datacenters, two of which are Tier III certified, as will be the new datacenter in Riga.

Why do companies across the world use datacenters in the Baltics?

Compared to other regions of the world, all three Baltic states are like one big city. There is no need to think about distances between Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius, as the network latency is a few milliseconds. Though on a European or global scale network performance matters, which is why customers choose local or regional providers to be closer to their users or connect their branch offices. Extended network connections and communication lines from Frankfurt to Tallinn, particular certifications required by certain industries, and tailor-made solutions for each customer's needs are some of the benefits for businesses. Datacenters in Latvia and Lithuania can also be a secondary backup site for their data.

We are combining the resources and competencies in our group of companies. In Latvia, we are currently working with international providers on their needs to use our services. Many businesses choose us because we provide not just pure colocation facility but complement it with managed services and build individual solutions like private clouds. In the Lithuanian company, we have a high-speed network infrastructure from Frankfurt to Tallinn, as well as the broad Lithuanian coverage.

How are you different from your competitors and what is your myDEAC cloud platform?

We try to be proactive and bold by flexibly adapting to customers' needs and serving up-to-date automatic IT resource solutions. Our aim is not just the local market, we aim our self-service platform to serve the needs of companies worldwide and export at least 50 percent of our business. Currently, DEAC customers from more than 40 countries already receive and access data from any location. Sometimes, we don't even know the physical location of the websites or email services whose data ends up with us.

The myDEAC automated self-service cloud platform helps businesses to manage IT resources more efficiently by purchasing and deploying virtual machines and expanding their infrastructure instantly. The platform services will expand beyond virtual machines to offer bare metal servers and rack asset management. Backed by more than two decades of datacenter expertise and thorough research into available platforms, myDEAC was built to offer features that even large global providers don't have - like unlimited traffic, own backup policies, instant service delivery in a matter of seconds and many other user-friendly options to help make the lives of developers and IT specialists easier.

What is DEAC's primary business and why the focus on export markets?

Customers can choose from various services, including dedicated server rental, colocation, cloud services, and customized IT solutions to meet diverse business needs. We are a regional Northern Europe datacenter player, though we understand that without export markets it would not be possible to develop our business further. So it was a natural step forward in our evolution and development to acquire new markets. We are already one of Northern Europe's largest carrier-neutral private datacenters operators and provide secure datacenter services to customers worldwide. In Latvian data centers customers are from retail, logistics, medical, and other industries. Our services are used by large banks, telecommunications companies, and government offices at our datacenters in Lithuania. In Estonian and other export markets, we work with construction companies, the banking sector and restaurants - we serve many different industries' IT needs.

Is a cheaper price the reason why enterprises choose you?

Datacenters located in the European economic zone and across the European Union (EU) use the same energy capacities, so the prices are more or less the same. Though it's also important to consider other factors when choosing an IT provider such as service quality, availability, and convenience. technology, and convenient services. We provide tailor-made datacenter solutions built specifically for each customer's business.

Compliance also plays a crucial role, as certain industries require particular certifications. PCI DSS compliance is important for banks and financial institutions for secure payment card data storage, processing, and transmission for example. Not all datacenter operators can guarantee that certification.

How do customers know their data is protected and secure?

Security and data protection are complex issues. In datacenters the highest data safety standards are in place, including ISO 27001:2013, to protect corporate data. From a deeper perspective, it is also a consumer decision as to how much they are able and willing to invest in security measures.

Various solutions for protecting business data, such as firewalls, VPNs, data encryption, backups, DDoS protection, and disaster recovery solutions are available for customers. Smooth business processes can be ensured by utilizing different infrastructure solutions, such as private or dedicated cloud, and shared cloud services to meet business-specific needs. Some customers choose to have additional security equipment for racks like cameras, locks and other options - we can adapt to their needs.

Our cloud infrastructure is adjustable to individual requirements, offering scalable and flexible storage solutions that grow with the customer's business. A disaster recovery solution based on multiple datacenters located in different places ensures that their business will continue to run in any event, thanks to the backup infrastructure.

What about compliance with the NIS2 Directive?

We are already working with customers and internally on how to implement this regulation. Collaborating with governments in each country ensures compliance with existing rules while also providing customers with advice to minimize bureaucracy.

It boils down to cost as well as additional time for audits and inspections. The good news is that when businesses choose us, they don't have to deal with cybersecurity issues - we take care of it with data security solutions tailored to the business and its industry to quickly restore operations also in case of cyber threats. As well as our IT experts will help entrepreneurs understand how to maximally avoid security incidents and their consequences on all system levels and what solutions to choose. Datacenters are always one step ahead regarding digital security and green development. It is the lifeblood of our business, and we breathe it every day.

How do you ensure that your datacenters are environmentally friendly?

Our datacenters run on electricity from renewable sources, and backup power generators use Neste MY diesel from renewable materials. We are also investing in the latest cooling systems and other energy efficiency measures. It's part of our business logic to spend as little as possible on energy - because it's our cost, that makes it necessary to look for sustainable sources and seek the opportunity to install our own solar power plants. In fact, what Europe has been talking about for the last two years, we are already doing - for example, using the heat generated by datacenters to heat our office.

Will SEB Bank's €30 million loan also contribute to efficiency solutions?

The investments will mainly finance the construction of the new DEAC datacenter in Riga, which will be one of the most sustainable in the region. It will also go towards expanding the DLC datacenters in Vilnius and the fiber-optic networks that interconnect not only our datacenters in Lithuania and Latvia, but also expand beyond. At least one new datacenter is also coming in Lithuania and that will probably be enough for the foreseeable future.

Investors and banks are in a way pushing us to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our operation to obtain funding for our expansion projects and that is a good force.

The price cap was introduced in autumn 2022 in response to soaring energy prices, in part fuelled by the war in Ukraine and consequences of economic recovery following the pandemic. If the price cap is scrapped entirely by the end of this year, Statec predicts that average electricity costs will jump up by a whopping 60%, while gas will go up by around 17%.

NICOTINE POUCHES - Luxembourg is lagging behind in the regulation of nicotine sachets. The Minister of Health, Martine Deprez has presented stricter rules this week. In future the government want the sachets to be treated like cigarettes, so the product may no longer be sold to minors and have a higher tax rate of 22 euros per kilo. No advertisting and restrictions on where the products can be consumed. Details should be clarified in the next meeting in the Chamber.

""There are certain sectors and areas where we could do a bit better,"" Vitkauskas told LRT RADIO.

Officials analysed the crisis preparedness of 14 hospitals in Lithuania's ten largest cities and towns a few months ago. Half of them were rated positively in terms of emergency preparedness, and the other half as satisfactory, according to Vitkauskas.

""There is no negative assessment, and we can be pleased that the minimum requirement to ensure the institution's operation for up to 30 days is met,"" he said.

The NKVC head noted, however, that ideally, hospitals should be ready to operate for up to 90 days in emergency situations, which is where the inspected establishments faced issues.

The official said the problems were related not only to shortages of medication or personal protective equipment but also, for example, to ensuring food supply.

""Certain establishments have decentralised food supply, so there is a very high dependence on food supply chains,"" he said.

The inspections revealed inconsistencies in the hospitals' preparedness for autonomous electricity supply.

""Every hospital I mentioned has generators, but some have only one and some have twelve. So, this difference exists,"" Vitkauskas said.

According to him, the Health Ministry has shared the inspection findings with each hospital and plans have been made to remedy the shortcomings.

The 42-year-old former economist, who just visited Ukraine, says that recent aid packages from the EU and US had been ""a good sign for Ukrainians"" and that ""for them the support is vital"".

""At the same time we understand that it might be that the war will last longer than we would like it to, so we must discuss how we will help Ukraine in 2025 and 2026,"" she told bne IntelliNews on the sidelines of the EBRD annual meeting in Yerevan last week.

To finance this continuing commitment, the West should not only use the net profit of frozen Russian sovereign assets in the West - as the EU Council approved this week - but the assets themselves.

""In our opinion the wisest decision would be to use Russia's frozen assets and deliver it to Ukraine,"" she argues. She also supports the US proposal at the G7 to use the assets as collateral on an issue of a potential $50bn issue of bonds to finance Ukraine.

To squeeze Russia further, Skaiste says that ""the prevention of the circumvention of sanctions is crucial"" and that they should be tightened particularly on the energy and the banking sectors.

""We must focus on implementation but we must not forget about broadening the scope of sanctions because there are still sectors that give Russia a lot of revenues,"" she points out.

Such measures require a EU decision but Lithuania, the other Baltic states, Poland and Finland are already pressing ahead with their own common sanctions targeting dual use goods that Russia could use in its war industry.

""We made our national list of dual use goods that should not be delivered to Russia and we are not letting those goods through our borders,"" she says.

Lithuania, which used to act as a conduit for exports to Russia, has decisively shifted away from that role, she says, a process that has been ongoing since well before the February 2022 invasion.

""The history lesson was much earlier than the full-scale invasion,"" Skaiste points out. ""Lithuanian business slowly but definitely turned to the West. Now our main partners are not in the east but in the western countries like Germany and the US. We can predict these partners; Russia is not predicable.""

The loss of the re-export business since the invasion has not had a big impact on the Lithuanian economy because there was little value-added in that trade.

""These [Russian trade] numbers have definitely decreased. We do not see a huge impact on the economy,"" she says.

As well as losing its Russian exports, Lithuania has also been engaged in a trade war with China over its acceptance of a Taiwanese diplomatic mission under the island's own name, rather than that of the capital Taipei.

Skaiste insists that ""the impact of the Chinese restrictions on our economy was limited"" as ""we were not dependent on that market"", which represents only 1% of exports. Moreover, exports to China and imports from China have since quietly recovered.

She says Lithuania has benefited from the way China's trade embargo was made an EU issue, with its partners joining an ongoing case against China at the WTO.

Vilnius has no plans to back down and would recommend other countries follow the same course. ""Our suggestion for other countries is they should lessen their dependence on autocratic regimes because you never know what they might do,"" Skaiste declares.

The main recent challenges to the Lithuanian economy have therefore been geopolitical, she says. ""Our economy performed quite well during these shocks.""

Lithuania's 0.3% decline in GDP last year was ""one of best results in the region"". This year the finance ministry forecasts 1.6%, though ""the latest data shows it might be even better"". At the same time, inflation - which had spiked at 24% in September 2022 - is forecast to fall below 2% on average this year.

Lithuania has been one of the star achievers since it joined the EU in 2004, though it has gained less attention than neighbours such as Poland. Its GDP per capita on a PPP basis has risen from around 50% of the EU average to around 90%. ""We definitely want to reach and overcome 100% of EU average GDP per capita, Skaiste says. ""We are an ambitious country.""

Lithuania has also maintained a conservative budget policy, and has rebuilt its fiscal buffers since the pandemic. Debt has fallen back below 40% of GDP, while the budget deficit is expected to be 3% of GDP this year, figures that many of its neighbours would envy.

However, going forward the finance ministry has to budget for costly investments in energy security and defence because of the Russia threat, as well as the long-term challenges of demographic shifts and climate change. The World Bank has also called for Lithuania to make stronger efforts to tackle poverty, where it still has one of the worst problems in Central Europe.

On energy, well before the war, her government built an LPG terminal at Klapeida that can also help supply gas to other Baltic states.

On electricity, it has invested in the electricity grid so that it can disconnect from the Russian Brell ring early next year with the other Baltic states and synchronise its network with that of Poland and the rest of the EU instead.

It has also overseen a big increase in wind and solar power. Skaiste says Lithuania now wants to be able to cover 100% of its electricity needs by 2030, from around 30% before the war and around 50% currently. This domestic power capacity would be entirely renewable. ""It is definitely achievable,"" she predicts.

""It is a long journey because it is very costly,"" she says. ""We did a great job. Now we can be completely independent. It is a big part of the resilience of our economy.""

""Green transformation is something that makes us independent,"" she argues, something that many nationalist politicians in Central Europe have yet to grasp.

Lithuania is also looking at nuclear power. ""We decided to focus more on renewables but we are preparing a new energy strategy for the next 10-20 years and one of the possibilities is small nuclear units,"" she says. ""We will explore the possibility to see if they fit in our strategy.""

The main current challenge now is ramping up defence spending, which the government has doubled to €2bn a year. In particular, the government needs to pay for a new national army division, universal conscription, and to prepare for the stationing of a German brigade in the country.

""Now the crucial debate in the country is about defence spending,"" Skaiste says. ""We need to increase defence spending by at least 0.5% of GDP if we want to pay for the things that need to be done. That is a lot.""

To pay for this the finance ministry is pushing for tax reform, which is set to be Skaiste's biggest challenge since she became finance minister two years ago.

""I think it would be wise to decide on tax revenues that could cover these challenges. I think there is a big problem,"" she says.

""If you say that the need for defence spending will last, it would be better not to compromise but to take a decision to last a long time,"" she adds.

However, discussions with other parties in the centre-right government ""were quite difficult"", she admits. ""We decided to postpone a final decision and discuss it in parts.""

The parliament has approved a green tax and cut tax exemptions for companies. A windfall tax on banks was agreed for 2023 and 2024 and Skaiste hinted that it might be prolonged for 2025 too. ""We see that bank profits are still very high and there is a national debate on keeping it for 2025,"" she says.

But more systemic tax-raising measures will have to be hammered out during the Seimas' spring session.

This has led to criticism from the European Commission, which has suggested an increase in property and green taxes to guarantee future fiscal stability.

The EU has also suspended some payments under its Recovery and Resilience Fund in a row over the government's tax measures, something that has enraged the finance minister. ""From my perspective, I don't think EU bureaucrats can ask me to do more than I have promised,"" she says.

The tax row comes ahead of what is likely to be a difficult election for the ruling coalition this October, with polls showing the opposition Social Democrats in a consistent lead.

Skaiste - who is seen as a potential future party leader - says that her Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats usually do better than the polls predict, and that there is a still a chance that the government might be able to continue.

Yet even if the government changes, she stresses that there is likely to be little fundamental change in policy, since consensus has largely been maintained since the country regained its independence in 1990 and then achieved Nato and EU membership in 2004.

""The consensus on the reforms to be part of the European family was part of our success,"" Skaiste says. ""The policies have not changed much in these years of independence. The orientation of our foreign policy, our economy, that is something that we do not fight about inside the country.""",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,0.3647058823529412,454139334,46,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/Gintarė_Skaistė_Cropped.jpg,

Energy Minister Dainius Kreivys called the document key for the energy sector and one of the strategic documents for the whole country.

""In the upcoming decades, we aim to switch to climate-neutral energy sources and to replace the fossil fuels we currently use. Electricity will become the main source of energy over the next 25 years, so we plan to generate all electricity for our needs. A lot of attention will also be paid to our energy security and reserve issues,"" Kreivys told the cabinet meeting.

Lithuania's energy transformation is estimated to create up to 140,000 new jobs and generate up to 11 percent of the country's GDP by 2050, with its estimated benefit to the national economy standing at 6.3 billion euros.

Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė said she is confident that the strategy will be adopted by the Seimas.

""I really see [the strategy] as a very coherent and complete vision. Let us hope the Seimas will back it and that this will ensure continuity,"" the prime minister told the cabinet meeting.

Environment Minister Simonas Gentvilas says the new strategy would require huge investments every year: ""Every year, 1-2 percent of GDP will have to be invested.""

Drafted by the Energy Ministry, the document sets out how Lithuania will generate all the electricity it needs by 2050, export it, increase its renewable energy production capacity, and make its industry greener.

In addition to being able to generate all electricity for its needs by 2050, Lithuania is also expected to export electricity to Central Europe, in particular Germany, where significant energy deficits are projected in the future.",lrt.lt,news,Lietuvos Radijas ir Televizija,,0.4666666666666666,454082638,26,https://www.lrt.lt/img/2024/01/09/1676088-356746-1287x836.jpg,

Outgoing head of state Gitanas Nauseda came very close to being re-elected in the 1st round of the presidential election in Lithuania on 12 May. He won 44.1% of the vote, well ahead of his main rival, Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte (Homeland Union-Christian Democrats, TS-LKD), who won 19.8%.

Lithuania's two leaders will therefore meet again in the 2nd round on 26 May, for which the outgoing President of the Republic is the clear favourite.

The two candidates had already secured the lead in the 1st round of the previous presidential election, and faced each other in the second round on 26 May 2019.

As opinion polls had predicted, Ignas Vegele, known for his opposition to the government's policies during the Covid-19 pandemic, came third with 12.55% of the vote. He said that he had probably lost a third of the votes he could have won because of the presence of other candidates who shared his wish to change the political system, in particular Remigijus Zemaitaitis (Aube de Nenumas, NA), who came 4th with 9.25%.

Turnout was high: 58.80% of Lithuanians went to the polls, +1.43 points compared to the 1st round of the previous presidential election five years ago. This was the highest turnout since the presidential elections of 21 December 1997 and 4 January 1998.

source : https://rezultatai.vrk.lt/?srcUrl=/rinkimai/1504/1/2070/rezultatai/lt/rezultataiPreRezultatai.html

Elected five years ago on the theme of prosperity, Gitanas Nauseda said he wanted to continue reducing inequalities in the country. ""My main objective was to reach the second round and I think I have,"" said Ingrida Simonyte when the results were announced.

""We are both serving public servants - I am the President of the Republic, she is the Prime Minister. Voters can assess my five years of work and her four years of work and draw their own conclusions,"" said the outgoing head of state. ""Gitanas Nauseda is seen as the safest choice for voters of almost all ideological persuasions,"" said Tomas Janeliunas, Professor of International Relations at Vilnius University.

Gitanas Nauseda represents continuity and therefore stability and security, two essential points in the eyes of Lithuanians against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. Lithuania shares a border of just over 200 kilometres with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

""The core mission of the President of the Republic is to defend Lithuania's geopolitical and security interests. Gitanas Nauseda's positions are close to those of the majority of Lithuanians. Moreover, there are no major differences between the positions of the main candidates on the European Union, Russia and NATO,"" points out Linas Kojala, Director of the Centre for Eastern European Studies. ""Lithuania's understanding of the Russian threat is unanimous and indisputable, and the main candidates agree on this point,"" added Linas Kojala.

Gitanas Nauseda and Ingrida Simonyte agree on the threat posed to Lithuania by Vladimir Putin's Russia. The country sees itself as the Russian army's next target should Moscow emerge victorious from the war in Ukraine.

Gitanas Nauseda has promised to continue putting pressure on Lithuania's Western allies to step up their military support for Ukraine. ""Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky has already said it all. The Ukrainians don't need our declarations of goodwill, which are useless in combat; they need air defences. As long as they don't have them, Ukraine will remain vulnerable"" declared the outgoing Lithuanian President.

Lithuania is one of Ukraine's biggest aid donors. Defence spending accounts for 2.75% of Vilnius's GDP. Ingrida Simonyte's government wants to increase this to 3% of GDP. Lithuania will also host a German brigade of around 5,000 soldiers on its territory between now and 2027. The three main candidates in the presidential election supported these projects.

Lithuania was also the first European country to completely do without Russian oil and gas. Vilnius imports electricity from Sweden, Poland and Finland, and is investing heavily in renewable energies.

However, Eduardas Vaitkus, a candidate calling for the lifting of sanctions against Russia, an end to military support for Ukraine and the normalisation of Vilnius's relations with Moscow and Minsk, received 7.33% of the vote. The candidate, running as an independent, claims that Vilnius' policy towards Russia and Ukraine is leading Lithuania into war.

Foreign policy and defence issues failed to provide a clear dividing line between the candidates, so it was personalities and socio-economic positions that steered Lithuanians' votes. ""Ingrida Simonyte is supported by voters from the Homeland Union-Christian Democrats and liberals, while Gitanas Nauseda is a left-wing candidate in terms of economic and social policy,"" said Ramunas Vilpisauskas, professor of political science at Vilnius University.

Finally, on 12 May, the second attempt to amend article 12 of the Constitution to legalise dual nationality failed. 1,396,828 voters, or almost 59% of the electorate, took part in the referendum on this subject. Of these, 1,014,304, or 73.90%, voted in favour of the change to allow dual nationality. However, it was essential that at least half of all eligible voters, i.e. 1,192,617 people, vote in favour of the amendment. This is the second failure after the referendum held on 12 May 2019, in which the turnout was too low to validate the vote (38.46%).

The question put to Lithuanians concerned a new wording for article 12 of chapter I of the Constitution, which sets out the conditions for acquiring Lithuanian nationality[1]. The proposed article read as follows ""Citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania shall be acquired by birth or on other bases established by law. The procedure for acquiring and losing citizenship shall be established by law"". Many political analysts have criticised the wording as unclear.

Around one million people have emigrated from Lithuania since the country regained independence on 11 March 1990. They have obtained the nationality of another country through naturalisation and have therefore had to give up their Lithuanian nationality, which they cannot pass on to their children. 1,200 Lithuanians lose their nationality every year when they acquire the nationality of another country.",robert-schuman.eu,news,Fondation Robert Schuman,,0.3254901960784313,453998374,51,https://server.www.robert-schuman.eu/storage/images/banque/largeur-975/2013-05-28-16-26-56.7014.jpg,

Heat pumps -- described as 'reverse fridges' and which heat homes using power and outside temperatures -- are considered vital to making home heating and cooling climate-friendly. The European Commission estimates that by 2040, more than 80 million devices will be installed across the bloc.

However, with higher upfront costs, heat pumps rely on power not being too expensive relative to gas. The industry and experts suggest that power should cost no more than two and a half times more than gas.

So when gas prices surged, heat pump sales followed suit - only to drop when gas prices fell back down.

However, a new report by the EU's Joint Research Centre identified the three EU countries where the energy price ratio favours heat pumps: Sweden, Bulgaria, and Portugal. In each country, power is at most 50% more expensive than gas -- a ratio favouring heat pumps, which operate three times more efficiently than gas boilers.

While the right energy price ratio boosts heat pump deployment rates, it is not the only factor, as government installation subsidies also make a big difference.

Sweden has over two million heat pumps installed - every fifth citizen owns one. In comparison, there is just one heat pump for every 50 citizens in Germany.

Heat pumps in Sweden - supported by up to €1,890 in subsidies - are most effective for cutting emissions because the country's electricity mix is already almost entirely renewable. As a result, the report finds that every new heat pump in Sweden emits 99% less CO2 than a fossil heater.

In Portugal, the heat pump market is dominated by air-to-air heat pumps, colloquially known as air conditioners. Still, despite the favourable price ratio, there is just one device for every 37 citizens. A support scheme covering 85% of the installation costs, capped at €2,500, hopes to increase these numbers.

Despite the favourable price ratio, heat pumps in Bulgaria struggle -- just one device is installed for every 160 citizens.

Some countries stand out for their outlandish power-to-gas price ratio: Italy, Belgium, and Lithuania.

Decades of installing air conditioners have resulted in a comparatively high share of heat pumps in Italy. These units provide cooling in Summer. As a result, one device for every 20 citizens is installed. However, power is four times more expensive than gas in Italy, so their use for heating in winter is much less attractive.

Belgium paints a similar picture -- except most heat pumps sold are the larger, more expensive (but more efficient) water-based models, so their share in sales is just 12%. With a power-to-gas price ratio similar to Italy's, they come at a double cost to their owners: high investment and operating costs.

Only Lithuania, where power is five times more expensive than gas, has a less favourable energy pricing framework.

What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman's firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.

What does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.

While there is a more...nefarious side to ChatGPT, it's clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.

Prior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (a super-charged version of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model) and a multimodal API. OpenAI also unveiled the GPT store, where users could create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT. Though the launch was delayed in December, it officially launched in January.

GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft's Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT.

Here's a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

The launch of GPT-4o has driven the company's biggest-ever spike in revenue on mobile, despite the model being freely available on the web. Mobile users are being pushed to upgrade to its $19.99 monthly subscription, ChatGPT Plus, if they want to experiment with OpenAI's most recent launch.

After demoing its new GPT-4o model last week, OpenAI announced it is pausing one of its voices, Sky, after users found that it sounded similar to Scarlett Johansson in ""Her.""

OpenAI explained in a blog post that Sky's voice is ""not an imitation"" of the actress and that AI voices should not intentionally mimic the voice of a celebrity. The blog post went on to explain how the company chose its voices: Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky.

OpenAI announced new updates for easier data analysis within ChatGPT. Users can now upload files directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, interact with tables and charts, as well as export customized charts for presentations. The company says these improvements will be added to GPT-4o in the coming weeks.

OpenAI announced a partnership with Reddit that will provide the company access to ""real-time, structured and unique content"" from the social network. Content from Reddit will be incorporated into ChatGPT, and the companies will work together to bring new AI-powered features to Reddit users and moderators.

OpenAI's spring update event saw the reveal of its new omni model, GPT-4o, which has a black hole-like interface as well as voice and vision capabilities that feel eerily like something out of ""Her."" GPT-4o is set to roll out ""iteratively"" across its developer and consumer-facing products over the next few weeks.

The company announced it's building a tool, Media Manager, that will allow creators to better control how their content is being used to train generative AI models -- and give them an option to opt out. The goal is to have the new tool in place and ready to use by 2025.

In a new peek behind the curtain of its AI's secret instructions, OpenAI also released a new NSFW policy. Though it's intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about if OpenAI -- or any generative AI vendor -- can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically.

In a new partnership, OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow's API and will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT. However, the deal was not favorable to some Stack Overflow users -- leading to some sabotaging their answer in protest.

Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles ""without permission and without payment"" to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot.

OpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe, London's Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. ""Through the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,"" the FT wrote in a press release.

OpenAI is opening a new office in Tokyo, and has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language. The move underscores how OpenAI will likely need to localize its technology to different languages as it expands.

According to Reuters, OpenAI's Sam Altman hosted hundreds of executives from Fortune 500 companies across several cities in April, pitching versions of its AI services intended for corporate use.

Premium ChatGPT users -- customers paying for ChatGPT Plus, Team or Enterprise -- can now use an updated and enhanced version of GPT-4 Turbo. The new model brings with it improvements in writing, math, logical reasoning and coding, OpenAI claims, as well as a more up-to-date knowledge base.

You can now use ChatGPT without signing up for an account, but it won't be quite the same experience. You won't be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have ""slightly more restrictive content policies,"" according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:

""The signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,"" a spokesperson said.

TechCrunch found that the OpenAI's GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services, and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools.

In a court filing opposing OpenAI's motion to dismiss The New York Times' lawsuit alleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that ""OpenAI's attention-grabbing claim that The Times 'hacked' its products is as irrelevant as it is false."" The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls.

At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI's VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists ""opt out"" of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous.

ChatGPT's environmental impact appears to be massive. According to a report from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day.

OpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps. The feature allows ChatGPT to read its responses to queries in one of five voice options and can speak 37 languages, according to the company. Read aloud is available on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models.

As part of a new partnership with OpenAI, the Dublin City Council will use GPT-4 to craft personalized itineraries for travelers, including recommendations of unique and cultural destinations, in an effort to support tourism across Europe.

New York-based law firm Cuddy Law was criticized by a judge for using ChatGPT to calculate their hourly billing rate. The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure ""well above"" reasonable demands.

ChatGPT users found that ChatGPT was giving nonsensical answers for several hours, prompting OpenAI to investigate the issue. Incidents varied from repetitive phrases to confusing and incorrect answers to queries. The issue was resolved by OpenAI the following morning.

The dating app giant home to Tinder, Match and OkCupid announced an enterprise agreement with OpenAI in an enthusiastic press release written with the help of ChatGPT. The AI tech will be used to help employees with work-related tasks and come as part of Match's $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024.

As part of a test, OpenAI began rolling out new ""memory"" controls for a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won't erase ChatGPT's or a custom GPT's memories -- you must delete the memory itself.

Initially limited to a small subset of free and subscription users, Temporary Chat lets you have a dialogue with a blank slate. With Temporary Chat, ChatGPT won't be aware of previous conversations or access memories but will follow custom instructions if they're enabled.

But, OpenAI says it may keep a copy of Temporary Chat conversations for up to 30 days for ""safety reasons.""

Paid users of ChatGPT can now bring GPTs into a conversation by typing ""@"" and selecting a GPT from the list. The chosen GPT will have an understanding of the full conversation, and different GPTs can be ""tagged in"" for different use cases and needs.

Screenshots provided to Ars Technica found that ChatGPT is potentially leaking unpublished research papers, login credentials and private information from its users. An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report.

OpenAI has been told it's suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy's data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven't been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: ""We want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.""

In an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers, OpenAI announced it's partnering with Common Sense Media to collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT as lacking in transparency and privacy.

After a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus questioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI's board, the company responded. The response, signed by CEO Sam Altman and Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, said building a complete and diverse board was one of the company's top priorities and that it was working with an executive search firm to assist it in finding talent.

In a blog post, OpenAI announced price drops for GPT-3.5's API, with input prices dropping to 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. GPT-4 Turbo also got a new preview model for API use, which includes an interesting fix that aims to reduce ""laziness"" that users have experienced.

OpenAI has suspended AI startup Delphi, which developed a bot impersonating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) to help bolster his presidential campaign. The ban comes just weeks after OpenAI published a plan to combat election misinformation, which listed ""chatbots impersonating candidates"" as against its policy.

Beginning in February, Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT's Enterprise tier, which the university plans to use to build a personalized AI tutor, develop AI avatars, bolster their prompt engineering course and more. It marks OpenAI's first partnership with a higher education institution.

After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudan admitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences ""verbatim."" Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI.

In a conversation with Bill Gates on the Unconfuse Me podcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be ""fully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support."" Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024.

OpenAI is forming a Collective Alignment team of researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and ""encoding"" public input on its models' behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI's public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a ""democratic process"" for determining the rules AI systems follow.

In a blog post, OpenAI announced users will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for ""personalized persuasion.""

Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting.

The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT.

In an unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of ""military and warfare."" In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to ""harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.""

Aptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs.

After some back and forth over the last few months, OpenAI's GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI's partners and the wider dev community.

To access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI's premium ChatGPT plans -- ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team.

Following a proposed ban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbots in the U.K., OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be ""impossible"" to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law ""does not forbid training.""

OpenAI published a public response to The New York Times's lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit.

In the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to ""act responsibly.""

After being delayed in December, OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Store sometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch. OpenAI says developers building GPTs will have to review the company's updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines to ensure their GPTs are compliant before they're eligible for listing in the GPT Store. OpenAI's update notably didn't include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront.

In an email, OpenAI detailed an incoming update to its terms, including changing the OpenAI entity providing services to EEA and Swiss residents to OpenAI Ireland Limited. The move appears to be intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union, where the company has been under scrutiny over ChatGPT's impact on people's privacy.

A study conducted by professors from Harvard and MIT, which is still under review, looked at how ChatGPT could affect the productivity of more than 750 white-collar workers, as well as their complicated feelings about using the tool. The study found that while ChatGPT was helpful with creative tasks, workers were led to more mistakes with analytical work.

In a lawsuit filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, The Times argues that millions of its articles were used to train AI models without its consent. The Times is asking for OpenAI and Microsoft to ""destroy"" models and training data containing offending material and to be held responsible for ""billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages.""

OpenAI has struck a new deal with Berlin-based news publisher Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider and Politico, to ""help provide people with new ways to access quality, real-time news content through our AI tools."" OpenAI will train its generative AI models on the publisher's content and add recent Axel Springer-published articles to ChatGPT.

New research from Stanford University shows that the popularization of chatbots like ChatGPT has not caused an increase in cheating across U.S. high schools. In a survey of more than 40 U.S. high schools, researchers found that cheating rates are similar across the board this year.

Starting in November, ChatGPT users have noticed that the chatbot feels ""lazier"" than normal, citing instances of simpler answers and refusing to complete requested tasks. OpenAI has confirmed that they are aware of this issue, but aren't sure why it's happening.

Some users think it plays into the ""winter break hypothesis,"" which argues that AI is worse in December because it ""learned"" to do less work over the holidays, while others wonder if the chatbot is simulating seasonal depression.

The U.K. Judicial Office issued guidance that permits judges to use ChatGPT, along with other AI tools, to write legal rulings and perform court duties. The guidance lays out ways to responsibly use AI in the courts, including being aware of potential bias and upholding privacy.

Following an experiment by Google DeepMind researchers that led ChatGPT to repeat portions of its training data, OpenAI has flagged asking ChatGPT to repeat specific words ""forever"" as a violation of its terms of service.

City lawmakers in Brazil enacted a piece of legislation written entirely by ChatGPT without even knowing. Weeks after the bill was passed, Porto Alegre councilman Ramiro Rosário admitted that he used ChatGPT to write the proposal, and did not tell fellow council members until after the fact.

According to a memo seen by Axios, OpenAI plans to delay the launch of its highly anticipated GPT store to early 2024. Custom GPTs and the accompanying store was a major announcement at OpenAI's DevDay conference, with the store expected to open last month.

After launching for iOS and Androidin May and July, ChatGPT's have topped 110 million combined installs and have reached nearly $30 million in consumer spending, according to a market analysis by data.ai.

OpenAI hit a major milestone: one year of ChatGPT. What began as a ""low-key research preview"" evolved into a powerhouse that changed the AI industry forever. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman looked back on the night before its launch: ""what a year it's been...""

Neither Apple nor Google chose an AI app as its app of the year for 2023, despite the success of ChatGPT's mobile app, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history before the record was broken by Meta's Threads.

A test led by researchers at Google DeepMind found that there is a significant amount of privately identifiable information in OpenAI's LLMs. The test involved asking ChatGPT to repeat the word ""poem"" forever, among other words, which over time led the chatbot to churn out private information like email addresses and phone numbers.

According to a new report by SlashNext, there's been a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails since Q4 of 2022. The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.

Following speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa's November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT. South African presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya refuted the claims, and local officials are investigating.

Now that OpenAI's ChatGPT Voice feature is available to all free users, it can be used to replace Siri on an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max by configuring the new Action Button. The new feature lets you ask ChatGPT questions and listen to its responses -- like a much smarter version of Siri.

Altman's return came swiftly, with an ""agreement in principle"" announced between him and OpenAI's board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.

Even if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the ""headphones"" icon.

The only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.

""Obviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they're not going to be in OpenAI,"" Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was ""open"" to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.

A number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company's board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT's future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.

Sam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company's board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board ""no longer has confidence in [Altman's] ability to continue leading OpenAI.""

In a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI ""was transformative"" for him and ""hopefully the world.""

OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.

Following OpenAI's Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus' new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.

An independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety.

OpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.

OpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that's strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.

As opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says -- largely due to technical hurdles.

Users and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI's marketplace and monetize it in the future.

After being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.

DALL-E 3, OpenAI's text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI's newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.

Bowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don't extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.

OpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.

At its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build ""agent-like experiences"" within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.

OpenAI's chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it's surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like ""Chat & Ask AI"" and ""ChatOn -- AI Chat Bot Assistant"", are actually making more money than ChatGPT.

Subscribers to ChatGPT's Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.

OpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.

The integration means users don't have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.

A Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the ""trustworthiness"" -- and toxicity -- of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of ""jailbreaking"" prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.

OpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures -- dropping from 30% to 20% in September.

OpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.

-- OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 27, 2023

OpenAI announced that it's adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.

The Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT -- accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI's premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot -- receiving the results directly within the chat app.

Powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.

The new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.

OpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system's image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.

ChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds ""enterprise-grade"" privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.

Recent Pew polling suggests the language model isn't quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.

With fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company's API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model's ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the ""feel"" of the model's output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.

OpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.

Fine-tuning costs:

In OpenAI's first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.

""We're very excited for the impact they'll have here at OpenAI,"" OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. ""The entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.""

OpenAI announced that it's expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service. The feature allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding.

Multiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple's China App Store ahead of the country's latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.

""As you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),"" Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. ""Based on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.""

A few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.

ChatGPT is available to ""pre-order"" for Android users.

The ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version's features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too -- so if you're iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.

OpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don't have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.

The company said this feature lets you ""share anything you'd like ChatGPT to consider in its response."" For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.

The FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI's flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made ""false, misleading, disparaging or harmful"" statements about people.

TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:

This kind of investigation doesn't just appear out of thin air -- the FTC doesn't look around and say ""That looks suspicious."" Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there's evidence the company lied about the side effects.

Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers ""with a history of successful payments"" can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.

In the future, OpenAI says that it'll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI's other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.

OpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.

The Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting ""GPT-4"" in the model switcher and choosing ""Browse with Bing"" from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.

U.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car's conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car ""Hey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.""

It's not really clear what for, though.

The new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.

On iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet's interface.

The Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that ""no portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,"" or if it was, that it was checked ""by a human being.""

OpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.

The ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries -- Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon!

ChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.

When using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices -- meaning it will know what you've previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI's open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.

Meta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users' devices.

""In one case, we've seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,"" said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. ""They would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.""

VC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft's investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.

Called ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as ""for professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.""

""ChatGPT Business will follow our API's data usage policies, which means that end users' data won't be used to train our models by default,"" OpenAI wrote in a blog post. ""We plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.""

OpenAI applied for a trademark for ""GPT,"" which stands for ""Generative Pre-trained Transformer,"" last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the ""myriad infringements and counterfeit apps"" beginning to spring into existence.

Unfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI's attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide ""appropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.""

That means a decision could take up to five more months.

Auto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI's latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to ""autonomously"" perform tasks.

Depending on what objective the tool's provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very... unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running -- and then ""killed"" itself.

FTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to ""turbocharge"" fraud in a congressional hearing.

""AI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,"" Khan told the House representatives. ""And I think we've already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We've been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,"" she stated.

The company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat's AI features.

Italy's data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month -- when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU's GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals' data.

The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline -- of April 30 -- to get the regulator's compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)

A study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a ""persona"" -- for example, ""a bad person,"" ""a horrible person"" or ""a nasty person"" -- through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity -- with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.

The research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI's GPT-4.

YC Demo Day's Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building ""ChatGPT for X."" They're all chasing after a customer service software market that'll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.

Here are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:

OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.

Italy's data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people's data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it's concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.

The letter's signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on ""all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.""

The letter reads:

Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.

OpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot's functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it'll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.

GPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.

ChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft's fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be ""Microsoft managed customers and partners,"" can apply here for special access.

OpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat's parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.

After ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for ""ChatGPT Professional"" as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.

OpenAI said that it's ""starting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT"" in an announcement on the company's official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no ""blackout"" windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT -- ""at least 2x the regular daily limit.""

A week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers -- Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston -- made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI's answers with the world.

GPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that's essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI's DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at it's 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

Much like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.

ChatGPT's generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been ""learning"" for a longer period of time than Bard.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is ""coming soon.""

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness -- in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Bard and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder -- if not impossible -- to run today.

The Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI's ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind's AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.

Apple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.

OpenAI has said that individuals in ""certain jurisdictions"" (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression ""in accordance with applicable laws"".

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled ""OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request"".

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on ""legitimate interest"" (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out -- when it writes: ""See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.""

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

The user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

A look at EP pre-election campaigns - Baltic News Network,"Soon Latvia will need to choose which of the 16 parties to vote for in the upcoming European Parliament elections. BNN has compiled a brief summary of the promises Latvian parties have listed in their respective promotional campaigns.

1. Harmony social democratic party

Despite the painful loss in the 14th Saeima elections, Harmony is back on top. Following a request from LTV, SKDS performed a survey in May. Results showed that 7.1% of Latvian voters are prepared to vote for Harmony. This political party is in 3rd place in the popularity poll.

Harmony lists simple but important topics like social support, medicine, education, housing and human rights as the core principles of its campaign. The party is part of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. ""The interests of Harmony's voters are taken into account on a European level, as opposed to Latvia, where leading politicians continue dividing voters into right and wrong groups.""

Harmony is also not too modest in congratulating itself, claiming that: ""The fact that as of the 1st of January 2024 the minimal wage in Latvia is EUR 700 us possible thanks to efforts from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, who insist on having a unified minimal wage principle in the EU"". As for its priorities, Harmony mentions that this year's EU budget needs to be bigger; more funding is needed to overcome crises and consequences of war. It is also necessary to control Europe's budget objectives more tightly.

When it comes to Latvia's obligations, it is important to prevent the risk of failure to use available EU funds, because ""various estimates suggest the country has lost between EUR 200 - 400 million"". Harmony also stresses that a separate financial support is needed for regions ""close to EU's external border and have suffered the most from the war - Latvia, especially Latgale, as well as Estonia, Lithuania and Finland."" The party also focuses on its main work horse - rights of Russian speakers. This much is listed in the party's campaign, specifically about the rights of Russian-speaking Europeans: ""[...] Russian language is not Russia's language. It is important for Latvia and the EU to develop and strengthen the European identity of Russian-speaking residents."" The party's campaign also mentions that ""the quality of Latvia's governance becomes more and more unprofessional every year and every cycle"" and ""the situation in the country is made even more complicated by the increased ethnic tension caused by the war and the mistakes made by leading politicians in Latvia, as well as intentional actions. Latvia needs to stop its continued downward economic and social spiral and the worsening of relations between Latvian and Russian speakers in the country. To do this, we need to change our country's management principles.""

2. JKP - New Conservative Party

According to results of the popularity poll, 1.7% of Latvian voters are prepared to vote for this party. The party's campaign mentions that ""JKP's goal in the EU is maximum possible protection of Latvia's interests - from language, security and business interests to the prosperity of every Latvian citizen."" In turn, among the ten cornerstones of work in the European Parliament, the JKP has put ""National interests above all"" as its main priority.

Then there is ""protection of Latvian language and culture"", ""Minimal bureaucracy and easy entrepreneurship"", ""Migration policy's change"", and ""Support for Ukraine is support for a safe Europe"". JKP also notes ""the time has come to slow down the green course"". ""We support a sustainable and environmentally friendly economy, but only without exaggerations. Until Latvia has reached the peak of EU's quality of life, its residents and national economy cannot be subjected to impossible requirements of the green course. We have to slow down,"" the party's campaign mentions.

JKP also promises to demand transparency in the use of EU's finances, as well as request lowering the parliament's costs.

3. National Alliance ""All for Latvia - For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK""

The popularity of the National Alliance reached 11% in May, ensuring a stable position of leadership. The motto of the party for European Parliament elections is: ""Protector of national interests - the voice of reason in Europe"". The campaign mentions: ""We are the only Latvian political force that has been able to prove its influence in the European Parliament in all terms since Latvia joined the European Union (EU). Let us continue to defend Latvia's interests in the EU, not the EU's interests in Latvia.""

NA promises to continue working in the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. Security is mentioned as the party's main priority, stressing that ""NATO remains Europe's safety guarantee"". NA promises to support EU initiatives aimed at expanding military mobility, response and cooperation, and stresses: ""Every effort must be made to support Ukraine in the fight against Russian occupation forces and to help Ukraine become a member of the EU and NATO.""

NA also promises to insist on ""widening sanctions against Russia while preventing possible deviations from existing ones"".

As for domestic security, NA mentions the need to strongly defend EU's external borders from the uncontrolled influx of illegal migrants, ""because there will always be migrants impossible to integrate into Europe's culture space, which could create potential threats."" NA also notes that the party does not agree with this year's changes to Europe's migration policy, which makes it mandatory for member states to relocate migrants or pay to not take them in. NA promises to overturn this principle. The National Association also advocates the sensible introduction of the Green Deal, stating: ""The direction of the Green Course is right, but it must be introduced at a price we can afford, while maintaining the EU's security, economic and social priorities.""

4. Latvia in First Place

This party can expect support from 5.8% of voters in Latvia. This party's declarative slogan is: ""Vote for a change of power in Latvia and Europe!""; ""Vote for a return of reason in Latvia and Europe that is based on the interests of every resident and stability!""; ""Vote for traditional values, for families composed of a father and mother - a man and woman, for families with children!"", etc.

The party's campaign states that ""the ruling politicians who have so far represented our country in Europe and spoken on behalf of the people have not defended the interests of the Latvian people - neither in Latvia nor in Europe! On the contrary - politicians elected from Latvia have usually tried to impose the opinion of European bureaucrats on Latvia!"" As a solution to all these challenges, the party offers to promote long-term investments of many billions in infrastructure and significant real estate development projects, pointing out that investment security in Latvia will thus become a common, international concern, but ""an abandoned and empty Latvia is a threat to our security and to the security of Europe as a whole.""

The party also promises to ensure full use of European funds to complete Rail Baltica project. They also support the allocation of significant European financing towards the reinforcement of Europe's border.

The party also stands in favour of a clean environment and nature protection as long as there are no exaggerations in the climate policy, because ""we don't need an even greener policy that risks causing Latvia's competitiveness to go down, economic stagnation or poverty"".

Latvia in First Place stresses the need to compose a general European policy to protect pensioners, people with special needs and lonely parents, ensure cooperation between European countries and mobility in the field of education and science. The party also wants to ensure social support for families with children so that ""our families would feel equal in the family of other European families - in terms of welfare, upbringing and providing educational opportunities!""

5. For Latvia's Development

This party can expect support from 4.2% of voters in Latvia. The party's campaign sits on three whales: ""for the European Union to become a true Security and Defence Union""; ""in order for EU funds to ensure the rapid development of the Latvian economy""; ""for Ukraine defeat Russia and join the European Union"". The tasks the party plans to work on in the European Parliament include: at least tripling the capacity of the European defence industry and five times the share of the EU budget allocated to defence, strengthening the Eastern border of Europe, agreeing on investments in external security of at least 3% of GDP by all EU countries, ensuring strict compliance with the sanctions imposed by the EU in all Member States.

The topic of EU funds is also a priority for this party. The party promises to take charge when it comes to the use of European funds in the interests of Latvia's development - starting with the national development strategy to the monitoring of the implementation of the most important projects. ""Because currently the opportunities provided by European funds are not being used to the fullest."" The party also notes that ""Latvian businessmen require more creative freedom and less self-directed EU regulation"".

6. Centre party

In May 2024 this party would receive support from 1.7% of voters. This party's campaign lists its main priorities: ""The Centre party's members will continue the work commenced by LKS member Tatyana Zhdanok to defend the rights of national minorities and non-citizens, fight against the rising neo-Nazism, adopt unified wage standards, balance work and private life, as well as ensure investments to equalise the development of European countries and regions.""

7. Association Jaunlatvieši

According to SKDS, this party would receive support from 1.3% of voters in May. This party wants to ""to voice loudly from the European Parliament's podium all the reasons why we have become one of the poorest countries in the European Union""; is about preserving the circulation of cash to ensure against the EU's plans to introduce central bank digital money in the Member States""; advocates ""family values, not manifestations of the Istanbul Convention that has not been adopted in society"" and categorically condemns ""the ongoing destruction of books in libraries of Latvia, which is implemented in accordance with the EU recommendations and guidelines on digitization"".

""We want to protect the market of local manufacturers and service providers, as other EU countries do in a smarter (including hidden) way. The absence of such a policy in Latvia has almost completely destroyed domestic farmers and producers and has widely opened the door to the entry of foreign products and chain stores, which politicians, misleading the public, call investments,"" the party states.

8. Combined List - Latvian Green Party, Latvian Association of Regions, Liepaja Party

In May 2024, the Combined List would receive support from 5.7% of voters. This party still puts emphasis on three-level defence: economic, civil and military. The economic section of the party's campaign mentions ""Decisions on greater strategic autonomy of the EU in the production of products such as microchips and the development of digital and artificial intelligence technologies will provide greater opportunities for Latvian companies"", as well as ""changes in banking policy in favor of the military industry, new requirements for banks, as favorable conditions as for environmental and climate goal projects"". But in agriculture, according to the party's campaign, each participant has his or her own role - ""large producers ensure the security of supply and strategic stocks, small and medium-sized - the viability of rural areas, the preservation and diversity of the national cultural heritage, the ability to provide for themselves and their family.""

The Combined List also stresses that a civil society is one of the pillars of security. ""An empty border and people who feel forgotten are a security threat.""

Regarding military security, the program emphasizes that ""the EU's border with aggressor countries should become military infrastructure, close, closed hybrid warfare and provocation efforts.""

9. Progressives

5.9% of Latvian residents with voting rights would vote for this party in May. The motto of this party is: ""Belonging in Europe. Protected in Latvia.""

The party believes that ""Latvia should take charge to make sure Europe is unified in its security both in the physical and virtual space, and so that we have military, cyber security and team skills."" The party also stresses that the EU needs to provide Ukraine with all the necessary political, military and humanitarian aid; rapidly move towards Ukraine's accession to the EU and ""support Moldova and Western Balkans on their path to joining the EU. We also need to support the democratisation of Belarus.""

Progressives promise to lower the use of fossil fuels, cease imports of gas from Russia, introduce a single formula for calculating a dignified minimum wage and pension, to introduce a single EU unemployment benefit, as well as to extend the EU's responsibilities in medicine by transferring the licensing and procurement of medicines to a central institution.

The party's campaign also includes advocacy for marriage equality across the EU, a desire to strengthen EU requirements for tackling the gender pay gap, as well as the inclusion of people with disabilities in the labour market, the creation of group housing, support for families and independent living.

10. People Power

This political party has support from only 0.6% of voters in Latvia. The party's campaign starts off with a rhetorical question: ""Has Latvia's voice been heard at least once and its sovereignty strengthened? Are the national needs of Latvia taken into account? No. Only poor gifts instead of social security. Instead of economic development and jobs we see only foreign decisions and foreign goods."" The party declares: ""The People's Power enters EP elections with confidence that Latvia needs to maintain its national interests policy. We support free, safe, independent and developed Latvian state in the EU!""

11. Movement ""For!""

The party, according to SKDS, had the support of 0.8% of voters in Latvia in May 2024. The motto of this party in the upcoming EP elections is: ""Safe Latvia. Free Ukraine. United Europe.""

The party stresses: ""Our vision is a safe Latvia and a free Ukraine in a united Europe. To achieve this, Russian aggression must be stopped. Our long-term security requires the integration of a reformed Ukraine into a transformed European Union within the next decade.""

The political party claims there are clear principles the EU and Ukraine have to change in order to implement the grand strategy - security through expansion.

12. Sovereign Power

2.8% of voters would cast their votes for this party in May. The party mentions in its campaign that traditional families have to be a priority group above the interests of any other group. The foundation of a traditional family is the union between a man and a woman. The Party also promises to raise the issue of the withdrawal of the European Union Member States from the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence because of the ideology of this Convention. The party stresses the need to stop wasting resources on various gender equality programmes and climate neutrality ideas.

This political party's programme also mentions that Green Course with its humiliation of farmers is a path that leads to food crisis not just in Europe. The party is ready to ""defend our country's food providers at European level: farmers, livestock farmers, poultry farmers, fishermen,"" as well as advocate for full-cycle production processes in Latvia, supporting entrepreneurs with motivating tax policies.

13. People. Land. Statehood

According to results of the survey, 0.4% of voters in Latvia would support this party.

This party believes Latvia's security can be guaranteed only through strong trans-Atlantic cooperation as part of NATO. Defence expenditure for us as a small country ""must be focused on the development of the defence technology sector: drone and high-tech air defence systems - robots, artificial intelligence - as well as the development of military logistics in the coastal ports of Kurzeme"".

The political party also notes that ""we have to stop hosting economic refugees and invest European Union funds in refugee centers in regions with refugee-related civilizations and climatic conditions similar to the country of residence.""

In turn, the main prerequisite for Latvia's development is an increase in the R&D budget to at least 3.5% of GDP, reaching the level of the Nordic countries, as this would allow Latvian universities from the best universities in the EU and the world to attract the most outstanding scientists.

The party also points out that, in general, the practice of centrally deciding on issues should be reduced, leaving more issues to the competence of the member states. It is necessary to review the impact of the already adopted regulations on the Latvian economy.

14. Union of Greens and Farmers

The example of ZZS confidently demonstrates that there is far from an equal sign between the choice of voters in the elections to the European Parliament and the Saeima. In the survey on support for various political parties conducted by SKDS on behalf of the LTV in April this year, ZZS with 7.6% support came in second place. In turn, in the survey on the European Parliament elections, which was conducted by SKDS on behalf of the LTV in the period between the 10th and 15th of May, ZZS received only 2.9% of voters' support.

The party's promotion campaign for EP elections lists: it is necessary to return to the founding ideals of the EU, emphasising human needs rather than bureaucratic demands. At the heart of European legislation there must be a logical approach. ""European regulation must take into account the specifics of each member state, confirming that Europe is united in its diversity and recognises the uniqueness of each member state, the party states.

As its main priority, ZZS mentions the security of Latvia and Europe. To accomplish this, the party says it is necessary to focus on the reinforcement of external borders, which requires tighter cooperation between the various member states. ""When developing a common European policy on Russia's economic embargo, it is necessary to clearly define the position on the import and transit of goods, including food, from aggressor countries,"" the party states. When it comes to energy independence, Latvia must use EU funds to prevent the shortage of electricity generation capacity, which would allow to reduce electricity costs.

The second cornerstone of the ZZS programme is the representation of the interests of farmers. The political force insists on the need to complete the alignment of area payments, to strengthen the short food supply chains of local producers, to increase EU support for the development of organic farming in Latvia. ZZS also promises to encourage a review of the requirements for granting support to meet the specifics and realities of Latvia.

As for the economy, ZZZ points out that ""economic justice in Europe should be universal, not shared between the old and the new member states"". In turn, Europe's high internal standards should be extended to imports from third countries.

15. New Unity

While at the beginning of the year no one had any doubts about New Unity as the leader of EP elections in Latvia, the various scandals that had surfaced over the past several months have severely impacted this party's popularity. Despite this, however, 8.1% of voters in Latvia would still vote for them, putting the party in 2nd place popularity-wise.

Members elected from the political force in the current parliamentary term are members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats). For these EP elections, the motto of the ""New Unity"" programme is: ""Safe Latvia in a united Europe"". The political force emphasizes that ""at a time when Russia continues its brutal war against Ukraine, the unity of the EU is more important than ever"". The party association ""consistently and strongly advocates the provision of all types of support -- political, economic, financial and military -- to Ukraine, as well as strong sanctions against the aggressor state called Russia,"" the programme states.

Freedom, democracy and the rule of law are seen by the New Unity as the main cornerstones of the values on which the entire EU is based. The political force also expresses its support for the enlargement of the EU to include new members.

The party believes it is necessary to develop a European economic security strategy - assessing and addressing the risks posed by investment in Europe by companies from unfriendly countries; combating malicious information manipulation by third countries by providing EU funding to promote civic resilience; develop a common policy on AI threat reduction and legal regulation; put into practice a common migration and asylum system that works quickly, fairly separates refugees from economic migrants.

When it comes to economic issues, New Unity promises to work hard ""in order to have an adequate amount of funding available to Latvia in the next EU multi-annual budget, also for the implementation of cohesion policy, the completion of the European railway line ""Rail Baltica"", the implementation of the green and digital transformation of the economy, as well as the development of our regions and rural areas.""

16. For Stability!

3.7% of voters would be ready to cast their votes for ""Stability!"" if elections were held in May. The motto of this party's programme is ""Political and economic independence in Europe"". ""For stability!"" believes: ""The policies implemented by the European Union today, which have a direct impact on Latvia, are practically incompatible with the development of the country and a prosperous future."" According to the Party, the future of the country is threatened by ""total economic poverty, bankruptcy of entrepreneurs, immigration policy, the absence of a children's program, artificially inflated taxes and prices on energy resources"". Therefore, the party also assumes responsibility ""to talk about"" prohibited"" issues and ""closed"" topics"".

The programme of this party has separate sections devoted to electricity, gas, banking, and sanctions issues. Here are some of the party's offers: reviewing and lowering the electricity price algorithm to the actual cost price; initiating the issue of exiting the European Nord Pool Group exchange; stopping the purchase of gas through intermediaries at artificially higher prices.

In the ""Sanctions"" section of this party's campaign, the party (albeit in a rather veiled form) invites to buy cheap energy without intermediaries from Russia, because the goals of the sanctions have not been achieved and ""Russia continues its development, operates successfully in international markets and European markets in an open manner with the help of intermediaries"".",bnn-news.com,news,"Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia",,0.4039215686274509,453904373,13,https://bnn-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ImportedPhoto.737889904.942534-2-696x465-1.png,

Protests against the final passage of a ""foreign agents law"" in the country of Georgia erupted again this week in the capital city, Tbilisi. The bill, which requires that organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from overseas register as representing the interests of a foreign power, was approved on its final reading this Tuesday in a parliamentary session held under heavy guard. While President Salome Zourabichvili will veto the measure, its supporters have enough votes to overturn her decision.

Opponents claim that the law is the handiwork of the Kremlin. The Russian government implemented a similar measure several years ago, and the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party is labeled as pro-Moscow. Demonstrators are holding aloft signs that read, ""F**k Putin,"" ""Slaves,"" ""Russians."" The US and the EU have both denounced the country's government for allying itself with Russia.

This week's mass gatherings, according to Western press reports, are in the ""tens of thousands."" Video clips show riot police, outfitted with batons, shields, and tear gas, pushing back against crowds and violently dragging people away. Several dozen have been arrested, including two US citizens and one Russian citizen. Demonstrators have blocked major intersections and set up encampments in the city center. Students at numerous universities staged a one-day strike on May 14.

The same day, demonstrators attempted to breach barriers and enter the parliament building, where a physical fight involving a dozen or more lawmakers had broken out. They intended to join the fray in an effort to stop or reverse the vote on the law.

Events unfolding in the small but geo-strategically important south Caucasus nation bear the markings of a looming ""color revolution."" Over the course of the 2000s, US and NATO-backed demonstrations in former Soviet-sphere countries, always labeled as ""pro-democracy"" movements, repeatedly overthrew governments deemed to be aligned with Russia. These operations adopted different colors, with Georgia itself having a ""Rose Revolution"" in 2003.

The ""color revolutions"" were invariably based on privileged layers of the middle class and brought to power an openly pro-NATO faction of the oligarchy which subsequently implemented devastating market reforms and oppressed all opposition. Georgia's ""Rose Revolution"" president, Mikheil Saakashvili, ultimately had to flee to Ukraine to evade charges of corruption and the violent abuse of prisoners. There he was protected by Kiev's far-right government, which was brought to power through similar events.

The protests in Tbilisi, which have been ongoing for weeks, come in the lead-up to parliamentary elections in October. The NGOs, opposition parties, and ""civil society"" activists orchestrating the street demonstrations seek to press Georgian Dream into retreat and a more subservient relationship with the US or, should that not work, to drive it from power. Speaking to CNN, former Georgian Ambassador to the EU Natalie Sabanadze stated, ""If this government doesn't withdraw this bill now, when they still have the chance, it will be hard for them to get to the elections. It's a spiral at the moment.""

The US and the EU have responded ferociously to the passage of the foreign agents law, which could expose much of Georgia's network of ""civil society,"" ""pro-democracy,"" ""human rights"" organizations to be US and EU-funded fronts.

US Assistant Secretary of State Jim O'Brien warned Tuesday that the country had now reached a ""turning point"" and implied that it will no longer be considered an American ally. In an admission of the fact that the US has spent billions of dollars meddling in Georgia, O'Brien indicated that Washington is preparing to cut off financing for the current government, which is ""now regarded as an adversary and not a partner.""

The EU, which Georgia has been seeking to join, indicated that it will halt the process of admitting the south Caucasus nation to its rank. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhely declared in a statement that the law is ""not in line with EU core norms and values.""

UK Minister for Europe Nusrat Ghani, promised -- as if it were up to her -- that the people of Georgia will 'rally against this law as long as it takes.' She warned, menacingly, that the bill against foreign agents was an ""existential threat"" to the country's survival.

In an extraordinary breach of diplomatic protocol, the foreign ministers of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Iceland -- countries that do nothing that they are not told to do by Washington and Brussels -- went to Tbilisi on Wednesday and joined the marches. Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna boasted of his presence there, posting footage of himself striding along with protesters on his X page. This would be the equivalent of Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Aleinik showing up at the antigovernment demonstrations in Washington and taking selfies.

The ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party, after years of attempting to ingratiate itself with Washington and Brussels while still retaining ties with Russia, finds itself trapped. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who blamed NATO expansion for provoking the war in Ukraine, refers to the Western alliance as the ""global party of war."" He expresses fears within the Georgian ruling elite, which are held more broadly in the population, of what is in store for them.

However, as over a decade of ever-closer relations with the White House and the EU show, if Georgian Dream could come to some sort of livable arrangement with the US and is allies, it would. And the US continues to try to establish its control over the ""pro-Russian"" forces in the south Caucasus. Assistant Secretary of State O'Brien, who arrived in Tbilisi this week, sought to meet with the party's billionaire financier, Bidzina Ivanishvili. He has thus far reportedly been turned down.

The ruling party has long tried to chart a middle road between the US and Russia, but the basis for such a balancing act has been almost completely undermined by the escalating conflict between NATO and Russia in Ukraine and the preparations for a direct conflict against Iran in the Middle East.

In the fall of last year, the country's security services reported uncovering a plot, funded by the West, to overthrow the government. The ""foreign agents law"" emerges within this context. Its immediate targets are organizations and forces tied to the US and NATO, which sections of the Georgian elite fear are preparing to dispense with them.

This does not, however, make the bill any less reactionary. Similar measures have been used to target socialists and other groups deemed to be too left-wing. Currently, Ukrainian Trotskyist Bogdan Syrotiuk -- a fighter against imperialism and both Russian and Ukrainian nationalism -- is jailed in Ukraine on trumped-up charges of being a ""foreign agent"" of the Kremlin.

However, the protests in Georgia are devoid of progressive content. The slogans advanced at the demonstration -- for ""freedom,"" ""democracy,"" a ""European future,"" and against ""Russian slaves"" -- amount to the demand that Georgia transform itself into a complete puppet of the American and European ruling classes and that it become yet another staging ground for war against Russia.

This can only result in catastrophe. The future that awaits Georgia in the event of another imperialist-backed ""revolution"" can be seen in Ukraine, where a far-right, CIA-run government has driven the population into a bloodbath in the West's proxy war against Russia. All opposition to the government is violently suppressed. Fascist hagiography has become the ideology of the Ukrainian state.

The interest of the US and its NATO allies in Georgia has nothing to do with democracy and everything to do with advancing its strategic and economic interests in an emerging new imperialist redivision of the world. For decades, Western militaries and spy agencies have been building up ties with the country. In 2015, a NATO Joint Training and Evaluation Center was established there. In 2018 the US Army set up the Georgian Defense Readiness Program. American military leaders have spoken repeatedly about the centrality of the country to their war aims.

The region is also valuable as a mean of circumventing Russian control over major trade and energy routes. Western powers have been centrally involved in financing several critical projects -- the building of a deeper water Black Sea port at Anaklia, the construction of an electrical line from Georgia to the EU that would deliver renewable-resource electricity to the European market, and the laying of an east-west fiber optic cable that ties together Asia and Europe, bypassing Russia.

The social and political character of the Tbilisi demonstrations is further revealed in the absence of slogans having to do with poverty, inequality, job security, overwork, inflation, or any of the other problems that occupy the overwhelming majority of the working class. These issues are not raised because for those on the streets they are not a major concern.

The anti-Russian sentiment spewing out of protesters is also bound up with middle-class resentments over the huge influx of well-to-do Russians into the country after the start of the Ukraine war. Tens of thousands have emigrated to their southern neighbor over the last two years, driving up prices and for real estate and luxury items. The layers coming to just 3.7 million have resources; they could not have emigrated unless they worked for foreign firms, had ample savings in foreign accounts, or had the connections necessary to set themselves up comfortably in a new country. In other words, they have already achieved what Georgia's middle class, stuck in a country with a Gross National Income per capita that is among the lowest in Europe, seeks -- or if they have it, they want more of it.

While economic and social demands are absent from the demonstrations, militaristic patriotism abounds. A May 10 article in Radio Free Europe (RFE/RL) noted, for instance, ""Georgian flags are ubiquitous at the demonstrations,"" The US-funded news service went on to highlight the political outlook of law student Zviad Tsetskhladze, ""who helped start the student marches"" and ""is one of the leaders of a youth group called Dafioni ('Sunset'), which has come to prominence during these protests.""

""The group,"" reports the press outlet, ""raised eyebrows at one early protest by having members swear an oath to 'defend Georgia's statehood... In Tsetskhladze's Facebook profile photo, he is wearing camouflage military gear, complete with a balaclava"" and reports that he ""love(s) military stuff."" He described fellow students as supporters of pro-Western and ""libertarian"" parties.

And amidst mass demonstrations throughout the world in opposition to the brutality of the Zionist state and its backers on both sides of the Atlantic, the protesters in Tbilisi have nothing to say about the mass arrest and beating up of pro-Palestinian demonstrators around the world, much less the slaughter of an entire people in Gaza.

Rather, the demonstrators in Tbilisi chanting the worn-out formulas of ""democracy"" and demanding a ""European path"" are celebrating those directly responsible for genocide. These positions are not actually in contradiction with one another. The efforts to install a pliant pro-NATO government in Georgia is a necessary component of the emerging new imperialist world war, which has already transformed Ukraine and Palestine into killing fields.

The report breaks down the role of advanced nuclear technology to meet decarbonisation goals and notes that various regions and governments are including the technology in core policy objectives. The report also offers an overview of the trends and challenges that face the nuclear supply chain, spanning from extraction and processing to end-use applications and waste management.

CRA's report, titled: 'Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies: A Tailwind for Nuclear Energy Revival' further says: ""The renewed prominence of nuclear in the energy transition reflects the growing emphasis on energy security and decarbonization among policy makers. Alongside the repowering of existing nuclear plants, advanced nuclear technologies are now also under the spotlight as they hold the promise of shorter construction timelines, lower overhead costs, and cross-industry applications.""

The report highlights that given some of the biggest challenges to infrastructure investing are inflation and regulation, including permitting and licensing, taxation, and safety standards, investors require certainty.

Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at CRA and co-author of the report, points to the recent collapse of Nuscale's Idaho National Laboratory scheme as an example of the challenges advanced reactors face when considering deployment: ""The Nuscale news really does show how difficult it can be for developers to line up all the different components in the macro context of high inflation and high interest rates. If you are a developer that started back when the rates weren't what they are today, you are going to be hit by them even if you're grounded in the best technological positions.""

Kotak points to some relatively simple solutions though: ""In the first instance, the industry needs government support to drive projects forward in the first of a kind development. The industry would also benefit from a coherent regulatory framework that crosses borders.""

Indeed, Kotak tells NEI that alongside sustained policy support, a better regulatory framework is needed for advanced reactors to deliver on their potential: ""The technology can be mature, the customers can be ready and we are seeing a lot of market demand there, but having those government policy and regulatory markers to incentivise investment is still needed. The central mechanisms aren't yet in the place that they need to be to enable the advent and progression of advanced reactors.""

Nonetheless, she does pick up on some positive signs of change: ""There is an element of sharing on the fundamentals across borders. There have been some examples with the US and Canada in terms of exchanging learnings on the regulatory processes that they're undertaking.""

However, Kotak notes that much of the regulatory structure was developed around large conventional reactors that has a knock-on impact on, for example, how insurance products for small reactors are set up and delivered. This in turn has an impact on how the private sector perceives advanced reactors as an attractive investment prospect. ""The regulatory system needs to evolve as the products evolve; investors seem interested in the promise of advanced and small reactors relative to conventional, but it's very much hinged on policy sentiment."" Kotak highlights the Inflation Reduction Act rolled out earlier this year in the US as an example of positive sentiment that could serve as a model for wider advanced reactor deployment: ""The tax credits that we saw in the US with the IRA, has been very promising given the wave of new developments and progress that occurred as a result. Given the nascency of these new technologies, the role of government and the introduction of supportive policy has shown to be important in navigating the uncertainty that comes with innovation.

Kotak also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed if advanced reactors are to be deployed at scale. ""Whilst there are nuances across the different technologies, considerations do need to be made with regards to the supply chain, and labour and skills capacity. Public sentiment towards nuclear is also part of the challenge and needs to be overcome, given the benefits, and passive safety features, that small and advanced reactors bring relative to conventional designs.""

Indeed, the report argues that under certain circumstances, the economic viability of advanced nuclear technologies is notable, offering some advantages relative to other energy sources, including renewable and storage portfolios. This distinction is particularly noticeable at high levels of renewable penetration when contributions to capacity from renewables starts to decline.

Kotak adds: ""It's exciting that there are so many different options on the table and each have distinct points that they're working through, but equally opportunities to offset. Whilst there might be a supply chain obstacle for one design, it might also enable it to advance because of other factors that are impeding a different design get solved first.""

Advanced nuclear can also offer a more appealing proposition for off-takers or utility buyers, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), which considers the relative contribution of the technology to the electricity system in terms of energy, capacity and flexibility services.

The report notes that the case for additional advanced nuclear capacity is reinforced by the fact that long-term operation of nuclear power plants has the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) among all other technologies, including newly built solar and offshore wind. However, larger reactors often have extended construction timelines and conventional nuclear reactors (Generation I, II and III) typically feature high levels of fuel expenditure, with most of the construction activities occurring at the reactor site. As Kotak says: ""Advanced reactors such as the molten salts, the micro reactors, they're all being predicated on the fact that they're trying to offset the challenges that the large reactors bring for example trying to offset those cost overruns that appear to be inherent with traditional designs. Each has a USP and each of them is trying to target or offset a problem that has been in the industry and that's a positive.

A recently published report on behalf of EPRI and conducted by CRA titled, shows how across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, a first of a kind (FOAK) small modular reactor (SMR) has an overall average capital cost that is 16% less than a conventional light water reactor (LWR), primarily driven by lower financing costs resulting from shorter construction durations. This could ultimately result in lower total project costs for smaller reactors compared to their larger counterparts when considering both overnight and financing expenses.

Additionally, when integrated with thermal storage, advanced nuclear technologies can provide enhanced flexibility in the delivery of ancillary services, further underscoring their intrinsic advantages compared to conventional alternatives.

The report says that merits of advanced nuclear technologies present a strong case for potential investment opportunities. While external influences, such as government and industry, play a major role in de-risking investment, the role of the investor itself is critical in bridging the investment gap needed to enable the transition towards second-of-a-kind reactors and achieve commercial returns.

""There is an argument to say that it is not which design will win, but which one will be able to be deployed first. There's a variety of market policy and regulatory factors, skills factors, supply chain and fuel factors that must be addressed, but at the end of the day, you need that customer demand and you need the funding to be able to get it not just to first of a kind, but to commercial return, which requires Nth of a kind deployment. This is where the returns that make it economic can be seen. The industry needs enough funding for it to get to not just one, but perhaps four, seven, reactors that enable Nth of a kind projections. At this point, the economic benefits align and compound the otherwise existing inherent benefits of small reactors, such as the ability to power remote locations and offset grid infrastructure problems, and the modular construction and factory build approach that is poised to offset costs,"" she says.

The report highlights a number of examples of policies encouraging private sector engagement, noting for example, that Canada and the US have consistently supported nuclear as part of their energy mix. Both countries have extensive governmental backing for the advancement of nuclear technologies.

Canada's introduction of a clean technology investment tax credit of 30% explicitly focuses on SMR technology. Canada also recognises nuclear energy as a 'fundamental and necessary component' of the low-carbon energy system.

In addition, the development of SMRs is supported at both the national and provincial levels. The federal government released its SMR Roadmap in 2018 and SMR Action plan in 2020, supporting the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for various uses domestically and internationally. Canada's federal budget for 2023, announced in March, provided a 15% refundable investment tax credit for clean electricity, including nuclear. This credit is separate from the clean technology investment tax credit introduced in the 2022 federal budget, which provided a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. On March 28, 2022, the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta released a plan outlining a path forward for SMRs as a deliverable under the provincial SMR memorandum of understanding (MoU). Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Bruce Power, New Brunswick Power and SaskPower have been working collectively to develop three streams of SMR project proposals. On September 21, 2023, the province of Alberta announced the allocation of US$5m in funding (C$7m) towards a multi-year research initiative aimed at assessing the techno-economic feasibility, as well as considerations for safety behind implementing SMRs within oil sands operations.

As Kotak says: ""Such policy measures would give confidence to investors that this is a technology that we are going to support and it is not going to be dropped and lose your investment. Similar to what was done with wind and solar. It's only at the price it is today because of that level of support to drive innovation and driving new supply chains. Private investment has come in now because of the amount of subsidies that went into it from the outset.""

The report also emphasises the growing role of the private sector, noting that in July 2023, OPG announced its collaboration with the provincial government to plan and license three additional SMRs, for a total of four SMRs at OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project.

Earlier in January, OPG, GEH, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed the first commercial contract for a grid-scale SMR in North America. The six-year partnership seeks to finalise the construction of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Darlington site by the end of 2028, with plans to commence power supply to the grid in 2029. This comes in the wake of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank commitment of US$713m (C$970), announced in October 2022, to finance the first phase of OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project. In 2021, OPG selected GEH's BWRX-300 SMR for the project.

Kotak picks up on these developments: ""It's great to see different vendor-utility or customer partnerships that are driving for clusters or multiples of reactor units that still reach the required output.""

The report notes that Europe is also seeing both public and private sector engagement, highlighting that the market is divided in its views on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and Lithuania, have phased out nuclear power; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal signed a joint declaration, opposing the inclusion of nuclear in the EU Green finance taxonomy. In contrast, France, the European leader in nuclear power, has brought together a 'Nuclear Alliance' consisting of 11 countries. This alliance will work towards strengthening cooperation in nuclear energy as an important component of Europe's energy goals.

In a bid to cement its leadership in civilian nuclear energy, France, in 2022, announced its plans to build six new next-generation nuclear reactors by 2050, with a possibility of deploying an additional eight. This plan was catalysed by Parliament's recent approval of the Government's nuclear investment plan, allocating €52bn to the construction of new reactors. While the project work is yet to begin, EDF Energy plans to commission its first two facilities in 2035 and a third in 2040. France's ambition to deploy its first SMR by 2030 contributes to the government vision for nuclear to account for more than 50% of the country's electricity mix.

The report further notes that in Poland, energy-intensive companies such as Synthos and PKN Orlen, established a joint venture to deploy an SMR fleet, GEH's BWRX-300. In addition, ENEA Group, one of the largest power companies in Poland, is collaborating with Last Energy to develop SMRs.

Other countries, including UK, Romania and the Czech Republic that have historically been dependent on coal to meet their energy needs, are increasingly turning to advanced nuclear technologies as a means of decarbonising their energy systems.

""We're seeing the private sector engage in Eastern Europe, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, with high-wealth individuals exploring options with small and advanced reactors. Bill Gates' TerraPower has shown what private investment can do to propel a new reactor design,"" says Kotak.

Kotak also points to a broader economic benefit to those nations that do successfully deploy advanced reactor technology: ""Once that first of a kind small reactor is identified and can be commercially developed, there could be significant export potential for a market."" She adds: ""The timeliness, limitations and opportunities of all clean energy resources - nuclear, CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal - need to be considered.""

The report says that the nuclear energy sector challenge is exacerbated by the imminent retirement of the current nuclear workforce. A multi-year, multi-unit build-up of nuclear reactors will require addressing the labour shortage at various stages, including education, recruitment for entry-level positions and the identification of highly skilled master tradespeople.

""From a vendor developer perspective, business models are set up with the intention to build more than one reactor, given the level of infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and people required. The repeatability is the USP. If the modular construction, factory build, and ability to just repeat orders isn't taken up on, it could miss a key opportunity. The report notes that designs are planned for modules to be built at factories and then transported to the main reactor site, reducing the total construction time required. Microreactors take this concept a step further and are designed such that the entire reactor can be transported at once,"" says Kotak.

Nonetheless, Kotak is optimistic, she says: ""Advanced nuclear technology could play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of our energy systems. I am positive because fundamentally, regardless of what design gets chosen, it has a role to play as a clean energy source, and to enable the pathway to net zero. I think, ultimately, we need to be reminded that all COP nations or signatories have all signed up to this to reduce emissions and to reach those net zero goals."" As Kotak concludes: ""As the costs become more secure, the investment returns become more clear and that regulatory and policy structures are in place to give that confirmation of returns, I think we will see more private investment, as we've seen with other energy sources.""",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.3333333333333333,453699639,22,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/Double_Unit_2_8K_1440x810.webp,eng-9584248

Speaking in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine about Taiwan's participation in three joint projects with the Czech government, Kopečný said: ""Taiwan's participation in these projects is unique. It was Taiwan's initiative when, a year and a half ago, this government quickly and spontaneously contacted the governments of the Czech Republic, Lithuania, and Poland, stating that they wanted to help Ukraine. And we said: yes, of course. We know Ukraine very well, we have relevant experience. This is unique because such projects have never been implemented before. Even though there are no official diplomatic channels between Taipei and Kyiv at present, it is especially important, also for us, that Taiwan is a country that helps the Ukrainian people. And the Ukrainian people will know about it.""

According to Kopečný, the governments of the Czech Republic and Taiwan are implementing three joint projects in the areas of energy supply, drinking water provision, and first medical aid for Ukrainians.

""In the medical field, we are talking about the supply of first aid systems to hospitals in Kharkiv region. This includes several fully modernized and equipped wards with trained doctors in the fields of gynecology, intensive care, pediatrics for children, and surgery. This was done because hospitals are overcrowded with patients suffering from combat injuries, and most doctors, as well as the available capacities, are used for them. The mentioned four areas are primary needs for millions of civilians,"" Kopečný said.

In the field of energy, the Czech Republic and Taiwan are supplying so-called ""co-generators,"" equipment that combines heating and electricity.

""These are large boxes with a generator that combines heating and energy for areas housing 15,000-20,000 people. This equipment is jointly produced by Czech and Taiwanese companies,"" said the government representative. According to him, a total of 10 such units will be delivered to Ukraine.

In the field of water supply, the Czech Republic and Taiwan are providing so-called ""water factories.""

""This is a container system connected to a polluted water source that purifies water to a drinkable level for the population. After the dam in Nova Kakhovka was destroyed, more than 1 million people in Dnipropetrovsk region alone faced a shortage of drinking water. Across Ukraine, according to UN estimates, there are between 5 million and 6 million people who lack regular access to drinking water. This is a really big problem,"" he said.

According to Kopečný, this equipment is mobile and can be easily installed on-site. A total of 13 units of this equipment will be delivered to Ukraine, with each capable of providing water for about 10,000 people. ""We are doing this in coordination with local authorities,"" added the Czech government representative.

He also said that the projects in the fields of energy and water, initiated last year, are designed for a year and will conclude in the upcoming June, while the medical project is planned for three years.

Kopečný expressed hope that the cooperation between the Czech Republic and Taiwan ""will continue, and the people of Taiwan and its government will see the benefits of such participation,"" including in the process of reconstruction and recovery of Ukraine.

""Such assistance makes Taiwan more visible on the international stage. They see that Ukraine is a place where events are happening that can also determine their fate. Ukraine has been experiencing aggression for many years, and at the same time, there are increasingly strong statements from Beijing about the reunification of Taiwan with China. Taiwan is a partner that cares about peace, and the world should care about Taiwan,"" said the Czech government representative.",en.interfax.com.ua,news,Interfax-Ukraine,,0.1764705882352942,453656811,1,https://media.interfax.com.ua/media/thumbs/images/2024/05/1U7t-_aKYtOF.jpg,eng-9576716

The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

This information comes from data on quarterly estimates for greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity published by Eurostat today. Quarterly estimates of greenhouse gas emissions complement quarterly socio-economic data, such as GDP or employment. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained article on quarterly greenhouse gas emissions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2%) and manufacturing (-3.1%). Emissions by households remained almost stable.

Greenhouse gas emissions down in 22 EU countries

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23.0%), Bulgaria (-17.0%) and Finland (-9.0%).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg). Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions. The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP.

This includes investment into the creation of a regeneration power plant in Acone, said Gren Group business manager in Latvia Andris Vanags at a press-conference.

The planned regeneration volume in Acone is 150 000 to 200 000 tonnes annually. This can potentially generate electricity for 40 000 households.

Vanags explained the heat output of the power plant will be 50 to 70 MW, and the electric output will be 15 to 20 MW. Sorted waste and waste not eligible to recycling will be used as fuel. This fuel will be sourced locally - in Latvia.

When asked about the choice of area for the construction of the power plant, Vanags said the chosen territory has connections to infrastructure.

Vanags said the project's planning commenced this year. Soon it is planned to commence environmental impact assessment procedure. After that there will be a public discussion. Once all that is done, development, construction and commissioning of the new power plant will follow, concluding with start of operations in 2029.

The regeneration power plant will be constructed to make sure no smell escapes from it. The flue-gas cleaning system will be used to purify the flue-gases produced during the production process, ensuring significantly lower emissions than allowed by the applicable laws and regulations.

At the same time, the regeneration power plant will be fitted with a constant emission monitoring system to ensure constant control and accessibility of transparent operational indexes for society and controlling institutions.

One benefit of having a regeneration power plant in the area, according to Vanags, is ensuring competitive heating energy prices, new jobs, sustainable use of local resources, and provision of further development of the energy industrial zone.

Vanags also stressed the importance of strengthening energy security and independence, significant reduction of waste in landfills, cleaner environment, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and reduced need for more landfills.

Vanags also said Gren's regeneration power plant in Acone is the first private investment project does not require additional state or municipal financing.

Vanags explained the heating energy will likely be injected to the network of Rīgas siltums, because the demand for heating energy is high enough on the right bank of Riga to generate each MW of energy efficiently.

Gren Group business manager in Latvia explained that landfills in Latvia continue growing, but their capacity is limited. It can also be seen that the environmental system policy is moving towards a faster reduction of waste going to landfills.

Currently 45-50% or 300 000 to 400 000 tonnes of waste generated by households every year is stored in landfills.

""The volume of energy that remains idle, stored in Latvian landfills is equal to 1 TWh, which is worth approximately EUR 20 million,"" said Vanags.

Ilkka Niiranen, Managing Director of Green Group, explains that there are approximately 500 waste regeneration power plants in Europe. They help reduce the volume of waste in landfills.

Niiranen stressed regeneration is a major opportunity for Latvia, because it is one of the last countries in the EU in which waste regeneration is not used.

Gren Group wants to perform investments that would benefit society. The company believes the planned investments will help improve Latvia's energy security and reduce the use of fossil fuels, said Niiranen.

So when the sirens went off on a sparkling spring afternoon on May 3, people in the center of Ukraine's second city didn't even look up. But the boom and crash that echoed across Kharkiv just before 2 p.m. was impossible to ignore.

It was, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov, one of the many aerial bombs -- shorter-ranged than the cruise missiles that swarm across the country, but bigger, nastier, and notoriously inaccurate -- that Russian forces have been dropping on the city.

Emergency workers examine the aftermath of a Russian strike on a residential building in Kharkiv on May 14.

This one struck an overwhelmingly residential neighborhood near the heart of Kharkiv, killing an elderly woman in one home, shattering blocks worth of windows, and bringing the roof down on Viktor's head as he sat in his living room.

As blood ran down the side of Viktor's nose, firefighters filled his yard and those around it, wielding hoses and fire axes to bring the blazes under control. They carried his TV to the dirt road. One handed Viktor a cigarette and a cell phone.

'Don't cry,' he said repeatedly once he reached his daughter. 'The house, the car -- everything's burned up, nothing's left. But I'm alive.'

Viktor, who lived in one of the homes most damaged by the Russian glide bomb, survived. His next-door neighbor did not. The Rescuers

Fighting fires is a high-stakes business in any situation. In Kharkiv these days, the stakes are arguably even higher.

The vibe back at the city's main firehouse was recognizable, like a clubhouse with a strong undercurrent of tension -- which has grown greater as Russia steps up its bombardment of the city.

The job has changed radically since Oleh Samoylenkov joined the force 24 years ago.

'Before, we hardly ever worked on demolitions -- really only if a gas line somewhere blew up, God forbid, or something like that,' he said back at the station, referring to clearing rubble, fighting blazes, and picking up the pieces after a building has been badly damaged or destroyed. 'Now, that's our main work.'

A blast from a Russian glide bomb in Kharkiv knocked out windows for blocks around and filled the street with rubble.

'It used to be just fires. Now it's fires under fire. And everything that's going on has some sort of military character,' said Viktor Danylenko, another firefighter at the same station.

Samoylenkov said that the most frightened he remembers being on a call was the first time he had to answer one as shrapnel flew. But for better or for worse, he says, he's gotten used to it.

These days, the firefighters don flak jackets on top of their normal gear, and military helmets as well. Bohdan, who guards the trucks when he is not driving the one with the medical supplies, has to put that armor on whenever there is an air alert on, which he waits out near the big glass doors of the station's garage.

When combined with the fireproof jackets, gas masks, and oxygen tanks that are part of their more traditional gear, the firefighters of Ukraine are heavily laden, resembling old-fashioned scuba divers -- but facing a very different element.

It's almost a relief when they have a regular fire to respond to -- someone's been starting fires in dumpsters, including one that necessitated a late-night response. 'Child's play,' said Samoylenko, with a wave of his hand.

The day before, the station's lights were out in keeping with region-wide blackouts until someone got a generator running. Then they could at least see the clock that hangs over the combined locker room and sitting area as its hands crept up on 7:30 a.m. -- the end of their 48-hour shift.

'It's a matter of chance. It might not happen, it might happen. Roulette,' Sasha, a younger firefighter, said around dawn. 'Today's the second day, so everyone's a little on edge.'

When their shift ended, the next team of 20-odd men arrived, taking up their posts in the other locker room, and these firefighters headed home.

Easter Sunday Attacks

Kharkiv is a city on edge. Russian forces occupied swaths of the surrounding region after launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but they never took the city and Ukraine recaptured most of that territory in a major counteroffensive later in the year.

Now there is fierce new fighting in the Kharkiv region: Last week, Russia opened up a new front in the region by pushing across the border northeast of the city and seizing several villages close to the frontier, prompting a wave of evacuations.

Visiting Kharkiv on May 16 after cancelling foreign trips due to the renewed fighting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the situation in the region was 'generally under control' but remained 'extremely difficult.'

Officials and military analysts say Russia is unlikely to be able to seize the city itself, and that may not be the aim of the offensive. But residents have been living with attacks from Russian glide bombs like the KAB-500, a Soviet-era weapon named for clocking in at 500 kilograms.

'Kharkiv today is much more than a city. Kharkiv is a symbol of the fortitude of Ukraine,' Terekhov wrote on Telegram on Orthodox Easter morning, May 5. 'The lives of over a million people are at stake.'

Another aerial bomb later that day wounded at least 15 people. Strikes from S-300s, an antiaircraft system that Russia uses as artillery at close range, would cause more damage in the early morning of May 10.

A factory that formerly made centrifugal compressors in the town of Derhachi, north of Kharkiv, was struck by an aerial bomb.

On May 2, a bomb hit a factory in Derhachi, a village about 15 kilometers north of central Kharkiv. Out of range of the fire brigade, it still hit home for Viktor, who lives in Derhachi and whose wife works in a grocery store within a block of the strike.

The Kharkiv region's governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said on May 9 that Derhachi was one of the key locations from which authorities were evacuating residents.

Fire Escape

Fighting fires sparked by Russian attacks is far from the only experience Samoylenkov has had with the war.

At the outset of the full-scale invasion, he lived even further north, and the initial Russian advance pushed him under occupation.

His 21-year-old son, Kyrylo, joined the army six months before the invasion. Russian soldiers found Samoylenkov by frisking and checking the phone of one of Kyrylo's friends, he said, finding a photo of his son in uniform and demanding to know where his family was.

They took Samoylenkov to a makeshift prison in the very early days of the invasion. When they released him, he realized that he was still in occupied territory. After being turned back while trying to cross into the city of Kharkiv, which Russian forces never seized, he eventually managed to sneak through, riding a bicycle on a backroad.

Viktor Danylenko and Oleh Samoylenkov, with 23 and 24 years on Kharkiv's fire department, respectively, show off a flak jacket, a wartime addition to their typical gear.

Kirill was killed in action that December, Samoylenkov says as he flicks through photos on his phone -- a series of images in which a blond teenager dons camouflage and visibly ages in a span of months.

'I still have a family, thank God,' he said, making a spitting gesture over his shoulder three times -- the equivalent of knocking on wood. When he was in Russian custody, his wife and toddler daughter made the trek through Russia and then Lithuania, eventually stopping in Germany. They're still there, waiting to come home, he says.

Firetrucks at the main Kharkiv station as an air alert sounds outside Killing Time

Along with the grim realities of wartime emergency response, the firefighters of Kharkiv -- like those in cities around the world -- are stuck biding long stretches of time between fire alarms. A lot of the activity in the intervals are chores. They wash equipment. They clean floors, walls, furniture, repeatedly. They sweep the driveway repeatedly -- though it's old, the place is spotless in a way you might not expect from a zone that constantly houses 20 men.

Overnight, the firefighters at Kharkiv's central firehouse are allowed to sleep in 2-hour shifts in narrow fold-out armchairs.

On this May morning, someone got a generator working. With electricity back on, the crew discovered that the water heater was broken, and Samoylenko and Danylenko wrestled with it for a while before getting it fixed.

In the kitchen, Andriy Talanov deftly peeled potatoes before handing them to Viktor Veretelnyk, who diced them. The two firefighters repeated the procedure with radishes and cucumbers which they dump in chicken broth into which they whisk a blend of sour cream and mayonnaise.

Whole bags of green onions and dill go into the cauldron of 'okroshka,' a popular cold soup that goes into the refrigerator for an hour and change before becoming lunch for the squad on shift.

Andriy Talanov and Viktor Veretelnyk sample the okroshka they are making during downtown at Kharkiv's main fire station.

This constant maintenance is interspersed with a continuous rotation of smoking breaks out on the ramp at the back entrance to the station. The men make guarded comments that it's been quiet. These are always followed by a trio of dry spits over the shoulder -- a ritual designed to foil a devil on your shoulder who might have heard your optimism and been on his way to ruin it by doing some mischief.

For the superstitious, the stakes of such mischief are palpable. As 7:30 a.m. rolled around, one of the firefighters set up shop near a sign-in sheet in the locker room. He was going through a separate roster, written on an envelope he had stuffed with bills, mostly small. He was checking that everyone on the shift now heading home had contributed to a fund they're gathering for one of their comrades, who died in a Russian attack less than a month earlier.

So when the sirens went off on a sparkling spring afternoon on May 3, people in the center of Ukraine's second city didn't even look up. But the boom and crash that echoed across Kharkiv just before 2 p.m. was impossible to ignore.

It was, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov, one of the many aerial bombs -- shorter-ranged than the cruise missiles that swarm across the country, but bigger, nastier, and notoriously inaccurate -- that Russian forces have been dropping on the city.

This one struck an overwhelmingly residential neighborhood near the heart of Kharkiv, killing an elderly woman in one home, shattering blocks worth of windows, and bringing the roof down on Viktor's head as he sat in his living room.

As blood ran down the side of Viktor's nose, firefighters filled his yard and those around it, wielding hoses and fire axes to bring the blazes under control. They carried his TV to the dirt road. One handed Viktor a cigarette and a cell phone.

'Don't cry,' he said repeatedly once he reached his daughter. 'The house, the car -- everything's burned up, nothing's left. But I'm alive.'

Fighting fires is a high-stakes business in any situation. In Kharkiv these days, the stakes are arguably even higher.

The vibe back at the city's main firehouse was recognizable, like a clubhouse with a strong undercurrent of tension -- which has grown greater as Russia steps up its bombardment of the city.

The job has changed radically since Oleh Samoylenkov joined the force 24 years ago.

'Before, we hardly ever worked on demolitions -- really only if a gas line somewhere blew up, God forbid, or something like that,' he said back at the station, referring to clearing rubble, fighting blazes, and picking up the pieces after a building has been badly damaged or destroyed. 'Now, that's our main work.'

A blast from a Russian glide bomb in Kharkiv knocked out windows for blocks around and filled the street with rubble.

'It used to be just fires. Now it's fires under fire. And everything that's going on has some sort of military character,' said Viktor Danylenko, another firefighter at the same station.

Samoylenkov said that the most frightened he remembers being on a call was the first time he had to answer one as shrapnel flew. But for better or for worse, he says, he's gotten used to it.

These days, the firefighters don flak jackets on top of their normal gear, and military helmets as well. Bohdan, who guards the trucks when he is not driving the one with the medical supplies, has to put that armor on whenever there is an air alert on, which he waits out near the big glass doors of the station's garage.

It's almost a relief when they have a regular fire to respond to -- someone's been starting fires in dumpsters, including one that necessitated a late-night response. 'Child's play,' said Samoylenko, with a wave of his hand.

The day before, the station's lights were out in keeping with region-wide blackouts until someone got a generator running. Then they could at least see the clock that hangs over the combined locker room and sitting area as its hands crept up on 7:30 a.m. -- the end of their 48-hour shift.

'It's a matter of chance. It might not happen, it might happen. Roulette,' Sasha, a younger firefighter, said around dawn. 'Today's the second day, so everyone's a little on edge.'

Easter Sunday Attacks

Kharkiv is a city on edge. Russian forces occupied swaths of the surrounding region after launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but they never took the city and Ukraine recaptured most of that territory in a major counteroffensive later in the year.

Window on an interior scarred from heat and shrapnel, Kharkiv.

Now there is fierce new fighting in the Kharkiv region: Last week, Russia opened up a new front in the region by pushing across the border northeast of the city and seizing several villages close to the frontier, prompting a wave of evacuations.

Visiting Kharkiv on May 16 after cancelling foreign trips due to the renewed fighting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the situation in the region was 'generally under control' but remained 'extremely difficult.'

Officials and military analysts say Russia is unlikely to be able to seize the city itself, and that may not be the aim of the offensive. But residents have been living with attacks from Russian glide bombs like the KAB-500, a Soviet-era weapon named for clocking in at 500 kilograms.

'Kharkiv today is much more than a city. Kharkiv is a symbol of the fortitude of Ukraine,' Terekhov wrote on Telegram on Orthodox Easter morning, May 5. 'The lives of over a million people are at stake.'

Another aerial bomb later that day wounded at least 15 people. Strikes from S-300s, an antiaircraft system that Russia uses as artillery at close range, would cause more damage in the early morning of May 10.

A factory that formerly made centrifugal compressors in the town of Derhachi, north of Kharkiv, was struck by an aerial bomb.

On May 2, a bomb hit a factory in Derhachi, a village about 15 kilometers north of central Kharkiv. Out of range of the fire brigade, it still hit home for Viktor, who lives in Derhachi and whose wife works in a grocery store within a block of the strike.

The Kharkiv region's governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said on May 9 that Derhachi was one of the key locations from which authorities were evacuating residents.

Fire Escape

Fighting fires sparked by Russian attacks is far from the only experience Samoylenkov has had with the war.

At the outset of the full-scale invasion, he lived even further north, and the initial Russian advance pushed him under occupation.

His 21-year-old son, Kyrylo, joined the army six months before the invasion. Russian soldiers found Samoylenkov by frisking and checking the phone of one of Kyrylo's friends, he said, finding a photo of his son in uniform and demanding to know where his family was.

They took Samoylenkov to a makeshift prison in the very early days of the invasion. When they released him, he realized that he was still in occupied territory. After being turned back while trying to cross into the city of Kharkiv, which Russian forces never seized, he eventually managed to sneak through, riding a bicycle on a backroad.

Viktor Danylenko and Oleh Samoylenkov, with 23 and 24 years on Kharkiv's fire department, respectively, show off a flak jacket, a wartime addition to their typical gear.

Kirill was killed in action that December, Samoylenkov says as he flicks through photos on his phone -- a series of images in which a blond teenager dons camouflage and visibly ages in a span of months.

'I still have a family, thank God,' he said, making a spitting gesture over his shoulder three times -- the equivalent of knocking on wood. When he was in Russian custody, his wife and toddler daughter made the trek through Russia and then Lithuania, eventually stopping in Germany. They're still there, waiting to come home, he says.

Firetrucks at the main Kharkiv station as an air alert sounds outside Killing Time

Along with the grim realities of wartime emergency response, the firefighters of Kharkiv -- like those in cities around the world -- are stuck biding long stretches of time between fire alarms. A lot of the activity in the intervals are chores. They wash equipment. They clean floors, walls, furniture, repeatedly. They sweep the driveway repeatedly -- though it's old, the place is spotless in a way you might not expect from a zone that constantly houses 20 men.

Overnight, the firefighters at Kharkiv's central firehouse are allowed to sleep in 2-hour shifts in narrow fold-out armchairs.

On this May morning, someone got a generator working. With electricity back on, the crew discovered that the water heater was broken, and Samoylenko and Danylenko wrestled with it for a while before getting it fixed.

In the kitchen, Andriy Talanov deftly peeled potatoes before handing them to Viktor Veretelnyk, who diced them. The two firefighters repeated the procedure with radishes and cucumbers which they dump in chicken broth into which they whisk a blend of sour cream and mayonnaise.

Whole bags of green onions and dill go into the cauldron of 'okroshka,' a popular cold soup that goes into the refrigerator for an hour and change before becoming lunch for the squad on shift.

Andriy Talanov and Viktor Veretelnyk sample the okroshka they are making during downtown at Kharkiv's main fire station.

This constant maintenance is interspersed with a continuous rotation of smoking breaks out on the ramp at the back entrance to the station. The men make guarded comments that it's been quiet. These are always followed by a trio of dry spits over the shoulder -- a ritual designed to foil a devil on your shoulder who might have heard your optimism and been on his way to ruin it by doing some mischief.

For the superstitious, the stakes of such mischief are palpable. As 7:30 a.m. rolled around, one of the firefighters set up shop near a sign-in sheet in the locker room. He was going through a separate roster, written on an envelope he had stuffed with bills, mostly small. He was checking that everyone on the shift now heading home had contributed to a fund they're gathering for one of their comrades, who died in a Russian attack less than a month earlier.

On an overcast day earlier this month, Mark Morrell was standing on Kingsley Road in Silverstone, Northamptonshire, surrounded by a film crew and pointing to a stretch of the street that has been repaired so many times it resembles a cross between a patchwork quilt and a lunar landscape.

It was all in a day's campaigning for the former utility engineer, who is widely known as Mr Pothole and has been making as much noise as possible about the parlous state of Britain's roads for the best part of 12 years. But this time there was a twist.

Morrell's crusade began when his then-teenage daughter, who had just passed her test, became worried drivers were swerving towards on-coming traffic to avoid a pothole near their home. Morrell complained to the council, got nowhere and eventually informed the police, ""which is, in reality, the only way you're going to get an emergency repair done these days,"" he says.

He started small with a Facebook page but clearly has a gift for publicity: early on he baked a birthday cake for a pothole that hadn't been fixed by the local council for more than a year. The stunt caught on elsewhere in the country and Morrell's national profile grew as the state of Britain's roads deteriorated.

But this time the film crew was from state-owned FranceTV, our cross-Channel neighbour's equivalent of the BBC. That's right, the utterly calamitous state of Britain's roads is no longer merely a national embarrassment; the humiliation is about to go global.

Perhaps the only surprise is that it took other countries so long to notice. The UK's road quality ranks just 37th in the world - a bit better than Lithuania, a bit worse than Slovenia. But those French television producers clearly know a good metaphor for modern Britain when they drive over one (and top marks for irony to the producer who decided to film the segment in the town that hosts the British Grand Prix).

Our most visible crisis

Britain can boast cutting-edge capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence, pharmaceutical innovation, finance, filmmaking and even some aspects of car manufacturing. And yet this country doesn't build enough houses and its roads are falling apart; modern Britain is an advanced society that is immiserating itself through poor land use and inadequate infrastructure.

A lot of the UK's problems - long NHS waiting times and crumbling schools, for example - are huge issues for those directly affected but can be somewhat abstract to the general public. There is, however, no hiding the state of Britain's crumbling roads. Michèle Dix, a former managing director for planning at Transport for London and now a commissioner at the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), says the state of the UK's roads highlights broader neglect of our transport links. Too often the focus and funding gets directed at building something new rather than maintaining something old, she argues.

Potholes have always been with us; some historians believe the term dates back to potters digging out the clay that formed the base of Roman roads. But the situation has never been worse. There was a 62 per cent increase in the number of potholes recorded by councils in Britain last year, according to analysis conducted by the pressure group Round our Way based on Freedom of Information requests.

The AA dealt with more than 630,000 pothole-related incidents in 2023, up 16 per cent on the previous year. The damage to cars is estimated to have added up to nearly £480 million last year alone. The Asphalt Industry Alliance's (AIA) aptly acronymed Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance survey calculated that the amount of money needed to fix the backlog of problems on local roads has now reached a cool £16.3 billion, a 16 per cent increase from last year.

Public ire

No wonder the nation's road users are so angry. Photos of stony-faced motorists pointing at asphalt cavities have become a mainstay on the front pages of local newspapers. Politicians gather around in high-vis jackets, stroking their chins and staring into grimy puddles as if they are font of all human knowledge. Last year the bonfire society in Lewes, East Sussex, famous for its topical effigies, burned ""Pothole Pete"", who was dressed as ""an indistinguishable civil servant"", on Guy Fawkes night.

A few months earlier, Sir Rod Stewart was spotted raking gravel after struggling to drive his Ferrari down a road near his house in Harlow, Essex. In many parts of the country local residents have started putting down their own traffic cones to warn drivers about the most dangerous potholes. In Lostwithiel, Cornwall, a ""phantom filler"" has started taking matters into his own hands and is fixing roads under the cover of night.

""People have had enough,"" says Morrell. ""There's long been plenty of anger about potholes, but now it's reaching boiling point. People spend a fortune on fuel duty and road tax but the problem just gets worse.""

The issue was brought into sharp focus earlier this month when it emerged that police were investigating whether an accident that resulted in the death of a 74-year-old Porsche driver was caused by the man swerving to avoid a pothole, near the Sussex village of Petworth. Elsewhere, residents of Charlton-All-Saints near Salisbury, Wiltshire have been left with only one way in and out of their hamlet after a pothole the length of a double-decker bus opened, rendering a road unusable.

All this ire is a particular problem for the Conservatives. Many of the party's traditional supporters live in the countryside and rely on cars to get around. Scores of Northern ""Red Wall"" seats the Tories won in the 2019 election are located in some of the most pothole-blighted parts of the country. The state of Britain's roads has become a key issue on the doorstep and Labour was punching the bruise in the lead up to the local elections, with claims there are 100 times more potholes on British roads than craters on the Moon.

The Tories have long been alive to the danger. Three years ago Rishi Sunak promised to fill in 50 million potholes. Last year, he earmarked £8.3 billion of the money saved from scrapping the northern leg of HS2 to fix roads. Esther McVey recently said this was ""the biggest ever funding increase"" for road improvement. ""We've given councils the cash to fix potholes,"" the minister without portfolio/for common sense wrote in The Telegraph. ""Now they need to get on with it.""

Scale of the problem

Clearly, £8.3 billion is a lot of money and motoring groups are broadly agreed it will make a big difference. But they also say it must be put in context. By McVey's own admission, the extra HS2 money will only pay to resurface around 5,000 miles of road, which is just 3 per cent of all council-managed roads in England, and will be dripped out over the course of 11 years. The trouble is, the AIA believes that around 107,000 miles of roads, about 53 per cent of the total network, will reach the end of their structural lives within the next 15 years.

""The scale of the problem now facing councils is truly gargantuan,"" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy. ""The status quo is not sustainable. The longer the Government fails to grasp this reality, the bigger the eventual cost to the public purse."" When it comes to this nation's roads, the UK failed to fix a stitch in time and is now left holding a bill for nine.

It's still worth doing though. The UK's pothole epidemic is costing the economy £14.4 billion a year, according to the first analysis of its kind conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). This took into account the damage to vehicles, accidents, extra emissions and more than 1.3 billion hours in additional journey time as the result of bad roads.

Douglas McWilliams, the economist who conducted the research for the CEBR and recently completed the Peking-to-Paris car rally, says: ""My take is that our roads are now worse for potholes than anywhere on that rally, apart from the far west of China and Mongolia, and notably worse than in both Russia and Kazakhstan - let alone western Europe.""

How did it get this bad?

We motorists tend to think of roads as horizontal. But from an engineering point of view they are very short and extremely wide vertical structures. Take a cross section of your local road and you'd see three distinct layers. At the bottom is the compacted subgrade soil. The middle layer, or road base, is graded gravel that will likely have been mixed with cement. On top is a covering of permeable asphalt.

That all sounds relatively simple, but there can be quite large variation in both the quality of the materials and techniques used to build the roads. And, according to Dr Benyi Cao, a research fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK has quite the reputation for scrimping on both compared with other European countries.

For example, after compacting the subgrade level, road builders will conduct quality control for water content to ensure that the base is neither too wet nor too dry. But there's a big difference in testing every few hundred metres, which Cao says would be considered best practice, and every mile or so, as sometimes happens. Similarly, if the road base isn't thick enough it will be more prone to flexing, resulting in cracks quickly appearing on the surface. Lower quality bitumen will become brittle more quickly.

Morrell, who worked in the utilities industry for 25 years before becoming a campaigner, has seen first-hand how road-building standards have slipped. ""When I had to dig up roads in London that were built 50 or 60 years ago it would break my heart. Those guys knew how to build roads that would last.""

Potholes start to develop because fatigue cracking, ageing asphalt and/or poor drainage results in water entering and remaining in the subgrade and base layers. The weather obviously presents its challenges. As you may have noticed, it rains a lot in the UK. Surface flooding is getting worse because of ""urban sprawl"", poorly maintained drains and climate change. The temperature also bounces around 0C (32F) for months at a time, creating a continuous freeze-thaw cycle during which water will repeatedly expand and contract, forcing cracks farther apart.

British roads are also among the busiest in the world. Lots of freight travels by lorry or van because the rail network is so unreliable. We're buying increasing numbers of SUVs and electric cars, which are heavier and therefore put more stress on the roads. Research by University College London suggests that the increasing reliance on satnavs is resulting in heavier traffic on minor country roads and urban ""rat runs"".

The UK also has more ducts and pipes carrying our gas, electricity, water and broadband laid under the roads than in other countries. Frequent excavations by utility companies and their poor-quality repairs further diminish the integrity of the carriageway. Some 55 per cent of all potholes in urban areas are caused by utilities digging up the roads.

Responsibility shifted to utility firms

Part of the issue is a little-known change in the law in 1991. Prior to this, companies had to pay highway authorities to repair roads after they'd been dug up. Westminster council charged £120 per square metre for this work. But under the New Roads and Street Work Act of 1991, utilities could reinstate their own openings. Costs dropped to an estimated £40 per square metre.

In theory the savings should have resulted in lower bills (or fatter margins for the utility companies). But the change in the law clearly had a number of unintended consequences. First, utility companies became less hesitant about digging up roads. Second, it was clearly in their interests to repair the damage they caused as cheaply as possible. And, third, the councils lost an important source of revenue that many in the industry believe was subsidising their other road maintenance work.

Politicians are now having to deal with the fallout. When he was transport secretary, Chris Grayling promised to make utilities put their pipes under pavements rather than roads - until it was quietly pointed out that utilities would love to do that, because it would vastly improve access, but unfortunately there's not enough space. Grant Shapps, one of Grayling's successors, threatened to slap companies that bodge their repairs with financial penalties. But this relies on councils having enough inspectors to assess the work. And, because of budget cuts, many don't.

Funding shortfalls

Successive governments have been squeezing local authority budgets for decades. Statistics from the Covid years can be fairly misleading. But the trends from before the pandemic tell a clear tale. Central government grants to local authorities have collapsed from £46.5 billion in 2009/10 to £28 billion in 2019/20 in today's prices, according to the Institute for Government.

Part of this 40 per cent drop was offset by increases in council tax. But even when this is taken into account, local authorities are staring down the barrel at an average funding shortfall of nearly 18 per cent. Many have understandably prioritised schools and children's social care, meaning the axe has fallen particularly hard on things such as road maintenance.

""Roads don't collapse dramatically, they just progressively get worse and worse, so it is easier to kick the can down the road a bit farther when times are hard,"" Rick Green, the chairman of the AIA, told The Telegraph last year. This is precisely what's happened.

Recent analysis by the Local Government Association (LGA) found that this reduction in funding to repair local roads was bigger than in almost every other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development club of wealthy nations, resulting in the UK falling from ""top to almost bottom of the league"" over two decades, according to Shaun Davies, the chairman of the LGA. Only Italy and Ireland had cut their budgets by a similar amount over that time, while the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark had all increased theirs by more than half.

There are various ways to crunch the numbers on this. Despite the Government's claim that the £8.3 billion diverted from HS2 would pay for the resurfacing of 5,000 miles of road, we know that just 1,123 miles of road were resurfaced in the 2021/22 financial year, compared with 1,588 miles in 2017/18, according to research conducted by the RAC based on government data. That's a drop of 29 per cent. Multiply that by 11 and you get 5,115 miles - more than the HS2 money will pay for.

Or you can look at the combined annual funding shortfall in the road maintenance budgets of local authorities in England and Wales. This now adds up to £1.3 billion, according to the AIA. If you again multiple that number by 11 you get to a figure of £14.3 billion. So, even with the HS2 money added to the pot, there's still a £6 billion gap.

""The Government is pushing this narrative of record investment in our roads,"" says one transport expert. ""But it doesn't make up for the cumulative cuts in funding that have been made over the years.""

Inadequate fixes

The result has been an over-reliance on patching potholes and making repairs rather than resurfacing roads, says Dix. Again, this can be done badly or well. The quickest and cheapest method involves shovelling cold-lay Tarmac into a hole, which workmen then, in the words of Morrell, ""tread down with their size nines"". Using hot Tarmac is marginally better. Cutting out a section of the road and then compressing hot Tarmac into the neat hole is best.

But if a pothole has formed, it almost certainly means the integrity of the road surface is already compromised. It will therefore only be a matter of time before the repair wears out or a new hole appears close by. The AIA likens patching to ""icing a rotten cake"". Edmund King, the president of the AA, says: ""Currently we often have a vicious circle of pothole formed, damage caused, pothole patched, pothole reappears with more damage caused - when what we need are more permanent repairs.""

What's to be done? The NIC has recommended councils outside London receive five-year budgets for road maintenance and that total funding be increased from £6.5 billion a year to £8 billion. The RAC has also been calling for a fundamental overhaul in how road maintenance is funded, perhaps by ring-fencing a proportion of the money the Treasury raises from fuel duty. Both proposals would provide councils with the longer-term certainty needed to better plan programmes rather than having to cope with ""boom and bust"" funding cycles.

New technology

Researchers are working on innovative solutions to our pothole problems. Rubberised asphalt, for example, adds shredded tyres to the bitumen mix in order to make the road surface more elastic and stop it cracking so easily. Some councils are already experimenting with adding a graphene-based material to asphalt. This is about a fifth more expensive but lasts twice as long.

A company called Roadmole makes a remote-controlled contraption that cuts circular sections out of the road surface around potholes rather than the usual squares, whose corners can become weak points for water seepage. The JCB Pothole Pro can fix a pothole in just eight minutes at a cost of £30. Stoke-on-Trent City Council's highways team is the first in the country to use this bit of kit and is already exceeding its repair targets.

The Nu-phalt Thermal Road Repair heats up a damaged patch of the road to recycle existing macadam and ensure it bonds better with new material. Then there's the Kiely Multipatcher from Australia, which needs only one person to operate it, combines pothole repair with small-scale surface dressing, and can mend about 100ft of road in under three minutes.

More Tomorrow's World solutions include a ""self-healing"" asphalt with steel fibres and epoxy capsules infused in the materials that repairs itself when heat is applied. Capsules containing bacteria can also be added to cement-based road materials. When they crack, the bacteria are released and start producing calcite (a form of limestone) as a natural byproduct of their metabolism.

Cao is experimenting with using ground-source heating and cooling systems to help regulate the temperature of the road surface to stop it melting in the summer and to break the freeze-thaw cycle in the winter.

However, Dix warns that the authorities need to remain mindful of more basic fixes. ""There are lots of things we can do [to prevent potholes], but digging drains by the side of the road should be first on the list,"" she says.

Whether the solutions are cutting edge or more rudimentary, they all cost money. There's not a lot of that to go around at the moment. But the alternative is, well, just take your car for a drive, your bike for a ride, or tune in to French television, to see what systematic under-investment looks like.

Lisa Doughten, Director of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' Financing and Partnerships Division, speaking on behalf of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that her Office recorded over 700 civilian casualties across Ukraine in April, including 129 deaths, a significant increase from March. Since 22 March, there have been five waves of attacks on the country's energy infrastructure, particularly in Kharkiv and Dnipro regions, causing rolling power outages and affecting millions nationwide. Moreover, attacks on ports are threatening their ability to export grain at a time of rising food insecurity.

Despite the spike in hostilities and the related risks, ""the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support"", she said. From the beginning of January until the end of March, 3.6 million people across the country received some form of assistance, and so far this year, 12 inter-agency convoys have delivered vital supplies to 20,000 people in front-line areas. Yet reaching civilians in areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- currently under Moscow's occupation -- remains a challenge, she observed, urging all parties to facilitate rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief to the 1.5 million people who require life-saving assistance.

Caitlin Howarth, Director of the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, said that 223 damage events across 23 of Ukraine's 24 oblasts were identified between 1 October 2022 and 30 April 2023. ""That's a rate of over 7 damage events identified per week, with peak impact timed for the height of winter,"" she stated, noting that these ""strikes of retribution"" -- as described by Russian Federation politicians -- mean extended periods without water, productivity lost, education fragmented and ""blackouts that last longer than the emergency batteries on life-saving health-care equipment"".

Against this backdrop, she asserted: ""As Russia's officials have comprehensively planned and executed their destruction of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, so should the international community systematically counteract this devastation."" She called on it to ""target the missiles"" through enforced sanctions; ""prepare for emergency"" by mobilizing resources today to ensure civilian survival this winter; and ""let Russia pay"" by releasing Russian Federation assets seized under global sanctions to fund these emergency preparations. ""Above all else, do not underestimate the scale of this threat,"" she stressed.

In the ensuing discussion, many delegates condemned Moscow's massive attacks on Ukraine's civilian population and infrastructure, noting that the worrying developments in Kharkiv Oblast demonstrate the humanitarian impact of the intensified hostilities. Several -- among them the representative of Denmark, also speaking for Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden -- expressed support for the upcoming first peace summit on Ukraine, which will take place in Switzerland on 15-16 June.

The representative of France observed that Moscow's attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity for which no impunity must be allowed. He welcomed the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued on 5 March 2024 against senior officials of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the campaign of missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure.

Guyana's speaker expressed particular concern about the continuing attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, stating: ""This cannot and must not continue"".

Calling for an immediate halt to ""this destructive campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" the United Kingdom's representative said that Moscow aims to terrorize civilians, obstruct livelihoods and businesses, and ultimately break down Ukraine's resolve. However, ""Ukrainians will not allow Russia to do that"", she said. She reiterated London's commitment of $55 million to the Energy Community's Ukraine Energy Support Fund, and over $214 million in overall support to the country's energy sector.

Echoing her sentiment, the United States' delegate recalled that his country recently announced $1 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, which includes urgently needed air-defence equipment. And since February 2022, Washington, D.C., has provided nearly $2.9 billion in aid to Ukraine and its neighbours -- including life-saving support for the 3.4 million people that remain internally displaced and the nearly 6.5 million refugees. The speaker for Sierra Leone called for fully funding the 2024 humanitarian response plan for Ukraine, while the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, pledged that ""the EU will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.""

The speaker for Poland said that the purpose of Moscow's barbaric actions is clear: to destroy the lives of Ukrainian people and make large parts of Ukraine uninhabitable. In this context, he voiced particular concern over the ongoing deportations and transfers of Ukrainian children and their forced ""Russification"". Slovenia's delegate noted the death rate of children jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year.

For his part, the Russian Federation's representative pointed to Western countries' failure to condemn the latest terrorist attack on 12 May, when the peaceful Russian city of Belgorod once again was targeted by a large-scale missile strike, killing 15 civilians. Western countries continue to provide long-range weapons to the Kyiv junta in ""the illusory hope of inflicting a strategic defeat upon the Russian Federation"". However, this will only prolong the Kyiv regime and cost the lives of tens -- if not hundreds -- of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians.

Ukraine's delegate said that Moscow launched a new offensive on 10 May, targeting the northern Kharkiv region with the immediate aim of taking the city of Vovchansk. While Ukrainian forces are holding the line to prevent Russian troops from advancing to Kharkiv -- the second-largest Ukrainian city -- he said that heavy defensive battles are under way, and the situation remains extremely dangerous for local civilians. Noting that Ukraine is now ""the only country in the world being attacked by ballistic and cruise missiles almost daily,"" he stated: ""The more active the world is now in restoring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine, the more likely it is that others in the world will not become the victims of similar aggression.""

LISA DOUGHTEN, Director, Financing and Partnerships Division, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, speaking on behalf of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that her Office recorded over 700 civilian casualties across Ukraine in April, including 129 deaths. While 90 per cent of the casualties occurred in Ukrainian-controlled territory, strikes have also been reported inside the Russian Federation, including on Sunday in the Belgorod region, reportedly causing several deaths and damage to residential homes. Attacks on civilian infrastructure across Ukraine have intensified. ""Since 22 March 2024, the UN and its partners have seen five waves of attacks directed against the Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" she said. Kharkiv and Dnipro regions are particularly affected. The country's Energy Ministry reported that up to 250,000 residents have experienced rolling power outages in Kharkiv and ongoing restrictions in Dnipro since March.

Noting ""the stark impact of these power cuts on the most vulnerable"", she said that they have temporarily left millions of households across the country with no power, water or gas needed for cooking, heating and hygiene. ""Children who rely on online schooling are not able to learn. Older persons with mobility impairments, persons with disabilities who use wheelchairs or other assistive devices, and mothers with small children are unable to leave multi-story apartment buildings to access food and medical support,"" she said. She cited a new pattern of attacks on railway infrastructure in the east and south -- with OHCHR recording 10 such attacks in Government-controlled territory in April alone. Also concerning are attacks on factories and production plants, limiting the availability of locally procured humanitarian goods, and on port infrastructure, threatening their ability to export grain and other agricultural commodities at a time of rising food insecurity.

Reported attacks damaging energy infrastructure and oil refineries in the Russian Federation ""risk enflaming the war further and worsening its humanitarian impacts"", she said. ""The intensification in hostilities is making the delivery of humanitarian assistance all the more dangerous. Nevertheless, the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support, despite the enormous risks,"" she said. From the beginning of January until the end of March, 3.6 million people across the country received some form of humanitarian assistance, and so far this year 12 inter-agency convoys have delivered vital supplies to 20,000 people in front-line areas. Assistance has also included the delivery of health-care services to nearly 860,000 people, and emergency water supplies for over 1.2 million people. Humanitarian protection activities have been expanded, including gender-based violence support for people newly displaced by hostilities.

Commending Ukraine's Government for the extra support it has announced for survivors of conflict-related sexual violence -- in the form of financial reparations and medical and psychological assistance -- she said donors have so far given $669 million, 22 per cent, of the $3.1 billion needed under the Ukraine Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan. ""Another challenge remains reaching civilians in areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that are currently under the occupation of the Russian Federation,"" she observed, voicing concern over the estimated 1.5 million people requiring life-saving assistance there and urging all parties to allow and facilitate the rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief. This war has caused the death and injury of tens of thousands of people in Ukraine, displaced millions, caused immense suffering and left more than 14 million people -- 40 per cent of the population -- in need of humanitarian assistance, she said, calling on the Council ""to seek an end to it"".

CAITLIN HOWARTH, Director of the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, recalling recent missile strikes on three thermal plants and two hydroelectric power plants in Ukraine, noted that -- by some counts -- ""near every single power plant"" has been targeted. Citing a report released by her Lab on 29 February 2024 documenting verified damage to Ukraine's power-generation-and-transmission infrastructure that occurred between 1 October 2022 and 30 April 2023, she said that 223 damage events across 23 of Ukraine's 24 oblasts were identified. She noted: ""That's a rate of over 7 damage events identified per week, with peak impact timed for the height of winter."" On 8 May 2024, almost 12 Ukrainian power facilities were reportedly struck in a single day and, since March 2024, successful targeting of power-generation facilities has further slashed Ukraine's capacity. ""Each hit compounds the problem,"" she observed.

She went on to point out that Russian Federation officials have clearly stated their objectives for targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure: first, to advance Moscow's military objectives; second, to retaliate for Ukraine's purported actions; and third, to inflict harm on civilians to compel Kyiv to submit to negotiations favourable to Moscow. She stressed that, while the first justification ""may"" be lawful under the law of war, the other two likely violate international humanitarian law. Further, while the Lab did not assess the degree of dual-use afforded by the energy infrastructure documented in its report, the law of armed conflict prohibits attacks on both civilian and military targets if the attack causes excessive civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these relative to any concrete or direct military advantage anticipated. Recalling a definition of Moscow's campaign by a State Duma member -- that it is aimed against Ukraine's ""whole energy infrastructure"" -- she emphasized: ""A comprehensive campaign, by its own definition, defies proportionality.""

She noted further comments by Russian Federation politicians that ""strikes of retribution"" on Ukraine's power infrastructure will make Ukrainians ""sit there without gas and without electricity and without everything"". Asking and answering what this means, she said it means extended periods without water, productivity lost, education fragmented and ""blackouts that last longer than the emergency batteries on life-saving health-care equipment"". Against that backdrop, she urged: ""As Russia's officials have comprehensively planned and executed their destruction of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, so should the international community systematically counteract this devastation."" To this end, she called on the international community to ""target the missiles"" through enforced sanctions; ""prepare for emergency"" by mobilizing resources today to ensure civilian survival this winter; and ""let Russia pay"" by releasing Russian Federation assets seized under global sanctions to fund these emergency preparations. ""Above all else, do not underestimate the scale of this threat,"" she underscored.

Statements

The representative of France said that the Russian Federation has shown no concern about its obligation to minimize injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. These practices may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity for which no impunity must be allowed. The International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued on 5 March 2024 against senior officials of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the campaign of missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure are a decisive step. He also welcomed the renewal of the mandate of the Human Rights Council's Independent Commission of Inquiry, which documents indiscriminate attacks against Ukraine's populations and critical infrastructure. He noted that mitigating the humanitarian consequences of this war by strengthening the resilience of strategic infrastructure will be a key topic at the peace conference hosted by Switzerland in June.

The representative of Ecuador expressed concern over the continued suffering in Ukraine and risk to regional and global instability. ""The statistics are alarming,"" he said, citing increased intensity and frequency of attacks against essential infrastructure, the destruction of hospitals and schools, and attacks disabling several energy facilities this month, affecting millions of people's access to electricity and clean water. The impact of attacks in the Kharkiv region has been equally devastating, with numerous civilian casualties and a significant increase in internal displacement. Condemning these attacks, he declared: ""International humanitarian law is explicit in its prohibition of attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure."" The warring parties must adhere strictly to the principles of proportionality, distinction and precaution to avoid escalating this cycle of suffering.

The representative of Guyana sounded alarm over the unrelenting attacks on residential buildings, schools, medical and energy facilities and grain ports since the start of the war. ""These attacks were often unrelated to frontline engagement and appeared to have little regard for the requirement of proportionality and military necessity,"" she observed. She noted the international community continues to witness large-scale coordinated attacks on civilian infrastructure, including dozens of energy facilities, resulting in disrupted access to electricity and water supply for millions of people in multiple locations. They are not only causing incidental civilian harm through the disruption of access to critical services but also resulting in loss of civilian lives and injury to those in near-to-target sites. There have also been attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, despite the many calls to end the attacks on or near the site, she cautioned, stating: ""This cannot and must not continue"".

The representative of Japan expressed regret that the Council heard another briefing ""about the many civilian casualties caused by the clear violation of the UN Charter by a permanent member of the Security Council"". Underscoring that attacks against civilian populations and infrastructure are ""clearly prohibited"" under international law, he also condemned Pyongyang's export and Moscow's procurement of ballistic missiles -- as well as the latter's use of these missiles against Ukraine. This transfer -- a clear violation of relevant Council resolutions -- supports Moscow's war of aggression and increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, he stressed, adding: ""We continue to monitor closely what North Korea gains in return."" He also detailed his country's support of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which includes the provision of two large autotransformers, six mobile-power-supply vehicles and five advanced gas turbines. ""Japan remains committed to supporting the Ukrainian people through bolstering the electricity and heating supplies in Ukraine,"" he said.

The representative of Algeria expressed grave concern about the destruction of civilian infrastructure, including energy and power plants. In addition, the worsening tensions and pursuit of hostilities have had dangerous repercussions on the international arena. He reiterated an appeal for diplomatic efforts to avoid a further humanitarian crisis and address human suffering without distinction. Civilians must be protected in line with the UN Charter and international law, including international humanitarian law. He called on all parties to set aside the mindset of confrontation and find what is needed to restore comprehensive and constructive dialogue.

The representative of the United Kingdom observed that this spring, the Russian Federation has targeted power plants, electricity sub-stations and gas storage facilities across Ukraine. Calling for an immediate halt to ""this destructive campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" she said that millions of people already face disruption to power, heating and water supply. ""These attacks are making an appalling humanitarian situation even worse,"" she said, noting that this is especially the case for frontline communities, as the attacks and lack of power hamper humanitarian partners' communications and movements. This pattern of aggression continues in an attempt to terrorize civilians, obstruct livelihoods and businesses, and ultimately break down Ukraine's resolve; however, she stated, ""Ukrainians will not allow Russia to do that"". London has committed $55 million to the Energy Community's Ukraine Energy Support Fund and over $214 million in overall support to the energy sector in Ukraine, she added.

The representative of the United States said that the Russian Federation's large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure are a ""clear escalation"" that threaten critical services. ""Next week, this Council will be subjected to yet another meeting where Russia will claim that Western arms are to blame for prolonging the war it started,"" he noted, urging that Moscow ""need only look in the mirror"" to understand why more than 50 countries provided support to Ukraine's forces. In April 2024, the United States announced $1 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, which includes urgently needed air-defence equipment. Further, since February 2022, the United States has provided nearly $2.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its neighbours -- including life-saving support for the 3.4 million that remain internally displaced and the nearly 6.5 million refugees. He added that newly approved supplemental funding will help maintain the humanitarian response amidst ""unabated"" attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure.

The representative of the Russian Federation said that if Western colleagues were striving to convey to the international community at least ""an iota of the truth"" about what's happening in Ukraine, then they would not be sweeping it under the rug. Rather, they would condemn the latest terrorist attack on 12 May, when the peaceful Russian city of Belgorod once again was targeted by a large-scale missile strike. A residential building was partially destroyed by a missile launched from Ukrainian-controlled territory, killing 15 civilians. He also highlighted the culpability of Western countries that continue to provide long-range weapons to the Kyiv junta in ""the illusory hope of inflicting a strategic defeat upon the Russian Federation.""

On 20 May, the Council will discuss these destructive actions of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. In early May, the United Kingdom's Foreign Minister, David Cameron, made a revelatory statement that the weapons provided by London could be used to carry out strikes against Russian territories, including areas beyond the special military operations' confines. The formulas or plans advanced by the Ukrainian henchman and his Western sponsors are so divorced from reality. Any discussion on them will become a pure loss of time, and ""you will become complicit"" in prolonging the Kyiv regime, with the cost of this being tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of the lives of ordinary Ukrainians.

The representative of Slovenia noted that, since early April, over 1,000 drone and missile attacks were recorded across Ukraine, forcing thousands to flee as their homes are being destroyed. She noted a reported 140 educational facilities were destroyed or damaged in attacks across the country in 2024 alone. And according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the death rate of children jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year. She further condemned Moscow's use of cluster munitions in its bombardment of Odessa in late April, stressing that ""using such weapons in a densely populated area is against all rules of international humanitarian law"". ""These attacks seek to impair Ukraine's economy and are obviously not directed against military targets. This is a clear violation of international humanitarian law and it needs to stop now,"" she said, adding: ""Ukrainian civilians have suffered too long. We call on Russia to stop with its subversive actions and give peace a chance.""

The representative of Sierra Leone expressed concern that attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have resulted in major disruptions of essential services, such as electricity, water and gas to medical facilities, manufacturing industries and places of work for ""a significant portion of the population"". This slows production and reduces economic activity, and he also expressed alarm over the impact on health-care facilities -- including those with incubators and other life-saving devices. On that, he noted that such facilities ""in some cases had to resort to the use of batteries that ran out before the re-establishment of power -- putting the lives of many at risk"". Given the devastating impact of the conflict on the civilian population, he called on the parties involved to adhere to their obligations under international law to protect civilian populations and infrastructure -- including energy facilities. He also called for the full funding of the 2024 humanitarian response plan for Ukraine.

The representative of Malta noted the Russian Federation's aerial assaults against Ukrainian power generation and transmission facilities in several regions last week. This deadly trend encompasses daily drone, missile, rocket and artillery attacks in Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions -- ""yet another example of Russia's disregard for human life."" As of today, more than 800 heat supply facilities have been destroyed or damaged and the attacks have caused more than $1 billion worth of damage to the energy sector, she said, expressing full support for the important work undertaken by the Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

The representative of Switzerland condemned the massive attacks on the civilian population and infrastructure across Ukraine, which have killed and injured civilians in populated areas. Last week alone, several children were injured, and schools and a hospital were damaged, she observed, stating: ""As Ukraine fights for its future, all those who can build it -- including children -- must be protected."" Noting an increase in attacks on critical energy infrastructures, she said that, in total, nine regions across Ukraine -- including those far from the front lines -- have experienced disruptions to their electricity supply in the past week. In addition, the situation around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remains worrying. Determined to do everything in its power to contribute to a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, Switzerland will host the first High-Level Summit for Peace in Ukraine on 15 and 16 June, she said, stressing the need ""to define together a road map on how to involve both sides in a future peace process"".

The representative of the Republic of Korea underscored that Moscow's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are unacceptable, as targeting such infrastructure violates international humanitarian law. He further stressed that, today, critical energy infrastructure ""holds far more significance in people's daily lives than decades ago"" when such law was created. In addition to hindering millions of Ukrainians' access to electricity in the short-term, the destruction of energy infrastructure has long-enduring impacts on the humanitarian situation in that country. A recent report by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) highlights a domino effect where such destruction leads to the disruption of other basic services such as water and sanitation. Noting that the lack of such services can impair the operation of hospitals and the viability of food production -- leading to the spread of disease, death and displacement -- he underscored that the Russian Federation's illegal invasion ""must end now to save lives and restore humanity"".

The representative of China said that his country is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it. It has long campaigned for peace and a political settlement. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. At the same time, the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously. In his recent visits to France, Serbia and Hungary, President Xi Jinping had an in-depth exchange of views with European leaders on the Ukraine crisis. China and Europe should work together to oppose the spillover and escalation of the fighting, create conditions for peace talks, and safeguard international energy, food security and the stability of the global supply chain. His country and France also agreed to seize the Paris Olympics as an opportunity to advocate a worldwide ceasefire.

The representative of Mozambique, Council President for May, spoke in his national capacity to highlight the devastating implications of the war in Ukraine for the humanitarian situation in the country. Noting that ""the prospects for a mutually accepted solution remain elusive,"" mainly due to the conflicting parties' firm belief in the primacy of military and zero-sum game logic at the expense of a cooperative approach, he underscored that the Council's consistent calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities ""can no longer be ignored"". Against this backdrop, he stressed the need to ensure the protection of civilians and to facilitate full, safe, rapid and unhindered access for humanitarian personnel.

The representative of Ukraine reported that the Russian Federation launched a new offensive on 10 May, targeting the northern Kharkiv region with the immediate aim of taking the city of Vovchansk. While Ukrainian forces are holding the line to prevent Moscow's troops from advancing to Kharkiv - the second-largest Ukrainian city -- he said that heavy defensive battles are under way and the situation remains extremely dangerous for local civilians. He added: ""Russian forces persist in razing Ukrainian towns to the ground without regard for the local population's suffering, with Vovchansk becoming the latest victim -- akin to Bakhmut or Maryinka."" Detailing numerous attacks committed by ""a country that called itself a friend of the UN Charter"", he noted that Ukraine is now ""the only country in the world being attacked by ballistic and cruise missiles almost daily"". Major cities have borne the brunt of these assaults, with devastating consequences.

""All the above crimes cannot be committed perpetually,"" he stressed, noting that a summit on peace in Ukraine will take place in Switzerland on 15-16 June. While stating that ""we have invited all peace-loving nations, and each nation can really bring peace closer"", he said that -- meanwhile -- Moscow intensifies its lies about ""a so-called peace deal that Ukraine and Russia were allegedly close to in spring 2022"". However, it is the Russian Federation President who has been ruining peace in Ukraine for more than a decade -- by occupying Crimea and parts of the Donbas in 2014, by obstructing the Minsk and Normandy peace processes, by launching a full-scale war of aggression and then by refusing to end it. Urging nations to attend the peace summit, he said: ""The more active the world is now in restoring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine, the more likely it is that others in the world will not become the victims of similar aggression.""

The representative of Germany said that the Russian Federation is attacking the foundation of the United Nations and global peace and security. As a nuclear State, it is invading its neighbour that has renounced nuclear weapons. By employing arms imported from Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it defies Security Council resolutions. To shield its illegal activities, it is dismantling instruments of this Council, such as the Panel of Experts for sanctions against Pyongyang. His country supports Ukraine with political, humanitarian and military means. Air defence systems supplied by Germany are actively helping to protect Ukrainian cities. Berlin has also invested in humanitarian relief efforts. The upcoming peace summit in Switzerland offers a unique platform. However, a just and lasting way out is only possible if Moscow renounces its objective of conquest and annexation, he stressed.

The representative of Estonia, also speaking on behalf of Latvia and Lithuania, said that every month, the Russian Federation uses over 130 types of missiles -- including those provided by Pyongyang -- over 320 Shahed drones and around 900 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine. As of late, chemical weapons can also be added to that list. ""These weapons are systematically used to kill and maim Ukrainian civilians, destroy homes, schools, hospitals and places of cultural heritage, attack food storage facilities and wipe out Ukrainian energy infrastructure,"" he stated. In total, Moscow's bombs have destroyed over 80 per cent of Ukrainian thermal power plants and 50 per cent of hydroelectric power plants.

He also highlighted that country's pattern of ""double-tap"" attacks targeting civilians and the rescue workers helping them -- ""the trademarks of Russia's aggression"". Accordingly, he underlined the need to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and the restoration of the energy infrastructure across Ukraine, noting that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have altogether contributed over $100 million worth of humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine and ""will continue to support Ukraine until the aggressor is defeated.""

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, underscored that ""every discussion on Ukraine must start by restating one unequivocal fact -- Russia's illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression constitutes a manifest violation of international law"". This is why that country must cease its attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure now, why its leadership must be held fully accountable and why all nations must come together in support of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine. Stressing that Moscow's indiscriminate attacks further exacerbate a dire humanitarian situation in Ukraine where over 14 million people require assistance -- ""you have heard so much about this here today"" -- he reported that the European Union has stepped up its provision of aid, including power generators and transformers.

The Russian Federation, however, has an obligation to allow such aid to reach all those in need, he said, also recalling the March 2022 legally binding order from the International Court of Justice for Moscow to immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine. He also stated that third parties must immediately cease providing material support to the Russian Federation's war of aggression -- ""or other kinds of cuddling"". Reiterating support for peace in Ukraine, he welcomed Switzerland's initiative to host a peace summit in June and called on all States to participate. ""The EU will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" he added and, to Moscow, he said: ""Stop your illegal war, and the illegal and inhumane means you are using to pursue it.""

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation is seeking to degrade the Ukrainian economy and society, making large parts of Ukraine uninhabitable. The purpose of these barbaric actions is clear: to destroy the lives of Ukrainian people and intimidate Ukraine and those who support it. In this context, he was particularly appalled by the ongoing deportations and transfers of Ukrainian children and their forced ""Russification"". Welcoming Switzerland's initiative to host a peace summit for Ukraine in June, he voiced support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace formula as a plan for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Ukraine and for the enduring security on the European continent.

The representative of Denmark, speaking also for Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, condemned Moscow's systematic and detrimental attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Noting that since 22 March 2024 there have been five massive attacks damaging over 80 per cent of Ukraine's non-nuclear power plants, she pointed out that this has included dangerous attacks on hydroelectric infrastructure which increase the risk of environmental disaster. She extended the Nordic countries' full support to the upcoming first peace summit on Ukraine in Switzerland, expressing hope that many countries will join.

Estonian renewables developer Evecon will benefit from the funding arrangement, the lender said on Tuesday. It will use the debt to bankroll the installation of photovoltaic (PV) plants in Birzai and Jurbarka, in northern and western Lithuania.

Once in operation, the solar parks will generate electricity for business clients and the public sector. The output of the Jurbarka plants will be used mostly by corporates, while the installations in Birzai will produce electricity for public institutions, including the Presidency of the Republic of Lithuania, Vilnius University and several municipal institutions.

Evecon has deployed more than 220 MW of solar PV capacity since 2020 and has an additional 200-MW portfolio under construction. Its total development pipeline in the Baltic States, which includes solar, wind, storage and hybrid parks, exceeds 4 GW.

Skype, Bolt and Wise are among the household names to emerge from the tiny Baltic country. While Estonia remains on top of many European startup rankings -- it's not alone anymore. The neighbouring Lithuania and Latvia are catching up quickly, making the entire region an intriguing target for international investors.

As with the rest of Europe, however, the economic slowdown stunted the Baltics. In 2023, Baltic startups raised $517m, according to Dealroom - a 70% decrease from 2022. But in investors' eyes, the ecosystem is booming.

So, which startups could be the next to make waves in the Baltics? To find out, Sifted asked VCs from Change Ventures, Tera Ventures, Firstpick, Baltic Sandbox Ventures and Practica Capital. The only rule: they couldn't nominate portfolio companies.

Andris Berzins, Change Ventures

Change Ventures is a Riga-based pre-seed VC firm backing Baltic founders globally.

Pactum develops AI to automatically negotiate supplier contracts on a massive scale for big companies. Its system learns the value of contract terms and performs high-quality and considerate negotiations to reach a favourable outcome for both parties. The company has been on Sifted's radar since it raised $1.15m in pre-seed funding in 2019. Since then, it's raised $35.2m from investors such as Atomico and Project A, according to Dealroom.

Ovoko is an online marketplace for used car parts. It offers shipping across Europe and a 14-day money-back guarantee. It has teams in Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and Ukraine. In total, it's raised $21.2m from VCs like Lithuania's Practica Capital, Poland's Market One Capital and the UK's Piton Capital, according to Dealroom.

Patchstack is a cybersecurity startup which develops a tool that helps identify bugs and security vulnerabilities in web content management system WordPress' websites, plugins and themes. It's raised $2.1m in equity and grants, from VCs like Estonia's Trind Ventures and Honey Badger Capital.

Andrus Oks, founding partner at Tera Ventures

Tera is an Estonian VC investing out of a €45m second fund into pre-seed global startups. Tera has a focus on AI/ML and fintech.

GScan is developing a new kind of 3D-imaging scanner. It uses naturally occurring atmospheric radiation to make detectors, which are powered by subatomic particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere. The scanners are designed to create safe radiation that doesn't harm people in the surrounding area when scanners are used. The startup has raised $10.8m of equity funding and grants -- most recently a $3m seed round from Markus Villig, the cofounder of mobility giant Bolt.

Value.Space develops technology that allows for monitoring and detecting anomalies in large infrastructure objects -- think mines or dams -- thanks to the data gathered by satellites. The startup raised an oversubscribed $2.1m seed round from VCs including Helsinki-based Inventure and Shanghai-based Amalfi Fund.

KOOS is a legal and technological solution for giving non-employee contributors stakes in a business via virtual shares. Unlike actual or 'real' shares, virtual shares do not give holders ownership in a business but can be turned into cash upon a certain triggering event, such as a public listing or acquisition. Success is only shared when the business reaches its goals, however, so the service acts as an incentive for contributors to stick around and help the company grow -- like stock options hope to do for employees. KOOS has raised €4m from VC firms Plural, LocalGlobe and Superangel, plus angel investors including Entrepreneur First cofounder Matt Clifford.

Andra Bagdonaitė, partner at Firstpick

Vilnius-based Firstpick is an early-stage VC investing out of a €20m fund. It has a sector-agnostic approach and focuses on the Baltics.

Twenty years after Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the EU, their electricity grids remain synchronised with Russian and Belarusian grids, which means that electricity in all the countries has the matching frequency and can readily flow across borders.

The Baltic states have long planned to instead synchronise their power systems with the EU's grid, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made this an even more pressing issue.

""Grids are the heart of our energy system, and have big geopolitical and strategic importance. This has been underlined by Russia's devastating attacks against Ukraine's energy sector,"" the Estonian EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told Euractiv.

Simson also said that ""Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will become fully integrated into the EU's internal electricity market and gain full control of their electricity networks. This will increase the energy security of the whole region"".

The three Baltic countries agreed to set ""early 2025"" as the deadline for synchronisation with Europe's continental grid.

The European Union has invested more than €1.2 billion in subsidies for the project.

""Synchronisation is the most monumental energy independence project in the Baltic States and it is in its final phase,"" the Latvian electricity transmission system operator, JSC 'Augstsprieguma tīkls' (AST) told Euractiv.

The Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian electricity systems were integrated into the IPS/UPS transmission network during the Soviet occupation. This network, which is largely managed by Moscow, supplies 280 million customers with electricity, mainly in the former USSR countries and Central Asia.

In 2007, the then prime ministers of the three Baltic states agreed a strategic objective of joining the European continental grid. On 20 June 2019, these three countries and the European Commission signed a political roadmap to achieve synchronisation.

Riga, Tallinn, and Vilnius have put an end to their electrical isolation by building new interconnecting transmission wires with Finland, Poland, and Sweden. However, their electricity networks remain synchronised with the Russian and Belarusian systems (commonly known as the 'BRELL ring').

In contrast, the EU countries of Central and Eastern Europe - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, which had all also been part of the Soviet bloc until 1991 - already synchronised their systems with the continental European grid (CEN) between 1995 and 2004.

Synchronisation with the EU grid is planned via the existing transmission line between Lithuania and Poland (LitPol Link) and a future submarine cable between the two countries. Technical equipment must also be deployed, to guarantee the overall stability and security of the electricity system.

Latvian electricity transmission network operator AST told Euractiv the project is 'in the final phase of work', with the installation this month of three 'synchronous condensers' in each of the Baltic countries and the reconstruction by June of the two interconnections between Latvia and Estonia.

In July 2022 Lithuania's Vice-Minister of Energy Albinas Zananavičius announced the country's intention to speed up the transition process and leave the BRELL transmission system before 2025.

Vilnius successfully conducted an isolated operation test of the country's electricity system in April 2023, proving they are capable of joining the synchronous network of continental Europe (UCTE) as early as this year.

However, Estonia and Latvia require more time, and Lithuanian authorities have agreed to wait until all three countries are ready before achieving full synchronisation with the European grid.

In March 2022, the Ukrainian and Moldovan grids were synchronised with the European power system. While the 'emergency synchronisation' could be completed rapidly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the move was based on preparatory technical work which began in 2017.",euractiv.com,news,EurActiv.com,,0.1215686274509804,453528107,59,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/shutterstock_1434482111-1-800x450.jpg,eng-9576905

Ignalina NPP is currently decommissioning two 1500MWe RBMK reactors that provided 70% of Lithuania's electricity before they were closed as a condition for Lithuania's accession to the European Union. Ignalina NPP has removed fuel from the reactors and placed it into dry casks for interim storage at the site pending construction of a geological disposal facility (GDF).

Through the project with Norway, a number of important tasks were resolved, including the development of concepts for a bituminous waste storage facility and a GDF, as well as advanced training of personnel.

The project involved the State Atomic Energy Safety Inspectorate of Lithuania (VATESI), the Norwegian Radiation & Nuclear Safety Authority (DSA), the Central Project Management Agency (CPVA), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other organisations. The total value of the implemented activities amounted to more than €3m ($3.2m), 85% of which came from the Norwegian Financial Mechanism.

""One of the strategic goals of the enterprise is the safe management of radioactive waste, ensuring that future generations do not inherit the unjustified burden of radioactive waste management,"" said INPP project manager Andrius Višniauskas. ""This project made it possible to solve problems related to radioactive waste management, which are not unique to Lithuania. At the same time, it was an exceptional opportunity to improve knowledge and competence in the field of decommissioning of nuclear power facilities.""

One of the tasks that the project solved was the transformation of a storage facility for bituminised radioactive waste. This storage facility was put into operation at the Ignalina NPP in 1987. The 5,600-square-metre building stores 14,400 cubic metres of bitumen compound, or bitumen radioactive vapourised salts. As part of the project, the possibility of modernising the complex for storing bituminous waste into a repository was analysed.

The project also included the preparation of a methodology for removing radiation monitoring of an industrial waste landfill and a research programme for the landfill, as well as geotechnical and radiological studies. The industrial waste landfill from 1985 to 2015 contained mixed construction and demolition waste, various packaging materials, unused equipment parts, and biodegradable waste. Over 30 years, more than 30,000 cubic metres of waste have accumulated.

The results of the research will make it possible to convert the landfill into a regular waste dump. A particularly important part of the project was the development of the concept of a GDF for radioactive waste. In Lithuania, it will be an engineering structure located at a depth of several hundred metres underground and designed for the safe storage of long-lived radioactive waste generated during the work of the IAEA (1983-2009) and during decommissioning (until 2038).

The GDF is planned to be built and commissioned in 2068. Site approval is expected by 2047. Until that time, the concept will be adjusted depending on the progress of the project.",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.2705882352941176,453487968,18,,eng-9574126

May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,1,,eng-9563546

Business development

In 3M 2024, we increased our Green Capacities Portfolio to 7.4 GW (from 7.1 GW) and Installed Capacity to 1.4 GW (from 1.3 GW). Our Secured Capacity stood at 2.9 GW.

We reached a number of significant milestones in the expansion and development of our Green Capacities Portfolio, including the following:

- we, together with our partner CIP, won the second seabed site (Liivi 1) in the Estonian offshore wind tender and see the site as a natural extension of the Liivi 2 sea area (secured in December 2023);

As a renewables-focused integrated utility, we focus on green generation and green flexibility technologies, including onshore and offshore wind, battery energy storage system (BESS), pumped-storage hydro and power-to-X.

We utilise our integrated business model and benefit from the largest customer portfolio, energy storage facility, and network in the Baltics.

To deliver on the ambitious goals in the Green Capacities and Networks segments, the Group plans to invest EUR 3.0-4.0 billion over the 2024-2027 period. This represents an increase of around EUR 1 billion compared to the previous strategic period, underscoring our commitment to a sustainable future.

Highlights of the strategic plan

We plan to double the Installed Green Capacities, reaching a total of 2.4-2.6 GW in 2027 compared to 1.3 GW in 2023. Currently, the Group's Green Capacities Portfolio amounts to 7.4 GW, of which 2.9 GW is Secured Capacity.

We aim building at least 2 offshore wind projects in the Baltics: one project in Lithuania (COD ~2030), and at least one more project in the Baltics (COD post 2030). We seek to reach at least 700 MW of onshore wind capacity installed by 2027 in the Baltics and Poland.

We keep a focus on the development of green flexibility technologies: pumped-storage hydro expansion by 2026 (by adding 110 MW to the currently existing 900 MW); we are targeting to develop commercial-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) by 2027 and implement a green hydrogen and e-fuel production pilot project.

We strive to further expand our customer portfolio to enable the Green Capacities build-out.

Our growing customer portfolio and focus on green electricity supply should lead to a significant increase in the amount of supplied electricity by the Group, from 6.7 TWh in 2023 to 9.0-11.0 TWh by 2027.

We plan to connect the growing number of new customers to the distribution network and to expand the capacity of electricity distribution network in order to enable a green transition and to meet growing demand related to electrification.

The Group is building a leading EV public charging network in the Baltics. We aim to expand across public, commercial, and home charging segments and focus on developing EV fast-charging network while being the first-choice charging solutions provider for the home and business customers.

To accelerate the green electrification in the Baltics and Poland, the Group is expanding its renewable organisation and is expecting to increase the number of employees at Ignitis Renewables 3.5 times by 2027.

Financial targets

In 2024-2027, we plan to invest EUR 3.0-4.0 billion with over 85-90% of the investments to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy.

We plan to direct EUR 1.8-2.4 billion (around 61% of the Investments) to further develop green generation and green flexibility technologies and double the installed Green Capacities. More than half of the Green Capacities Investments over the 2024-2027 period relate to new Installed Green Capacities additions after 2027.

We are planning to direct EUR 1.1-1.3 billion or one third of our Investments towards the expansion of a resilient and efficient electricity distribution network, which is one of key elements of a successful energy transition.

We are expecting the Group's Adjusted EBITDA in 2027 to be within the range of EUR 550-650 million compared to EUR 484.7 million in 2023. The average Adjusted ROCE is projected to reach 6.5-7.5% in 2024-2027.

We expect to maintain our credit rating of 'BBB' and above over the 2024-2027 period. We will continue our investment programme while maintaining net debt to EBITDA below 5 times.

We are committed to a at least 3% annual dividend growth, representing a 7.3-8.0% implied dividend yield in the 2024-2027 period.

Sustainability priorities and targets

We aim to reach net zero emissions by 2040-2050 and expect over 85-90% of our total Investments to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy in the period 2024-2027. We aim to achieve the sustainable share of Adjusted EBITDA of at least 70-75% by 2027.

We will maximise sustainable value by directing our Investments toward a decarbonisation pathway that is aligned with our business ambitions and reaching net zero emissions by 2040-2050. Our sustainability-related priority is reducing the carbon intensity of scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions (by ~20-40% in 2027 vs. 2023) by growing Installed Green Capacities and increasing the share of green electricity used for our operations.

We strive to grow the share of green electricity we supply (over 30% by 2027 compared to 17% in 2023).

We keep a strong strategic focus on occupational health and safety, employee experience, well-being, and diversity.

Long-term performance objectives

Following the Strategic Plan, the Supervisory Board of Ignitis Group approved the long-term objectives and performance targets for the 2024-2027 period that determine a long-term variable part of remuneration for key executives.

Details of the Long-Term Incentive Plan objectives for the 2024-2027 period are available in the Strategic Plan's annexes and on our website (link).

Growth was recorded across all business segments, except Reserve Capacities. Customers & Solutions segment electricity B2C activities continued to be loss-making (EUR -8.2 million). The Green Capacities segment remains the largest contributor with a 42.4% share of the Group's total Adjusted EBITDA.

We increased Investments by 73.4% YoY to EUR 209.5 million. Two thirds of the total Investments were directed towards the Green Capacities segment, and 90.5% to Lithuania. The Investments into Green Capacities have tripled and reached EUR 138.9 million, with the majority directed towards new onshore wind farms.

The Group's leverage metrics remained strong, with FFO/Net Debt ratio at a solid level of 28.9% (compared to 29.4% as of 31 December 2023).

Business development

In 3M 2024, we increased our Green Capacities Portfolio to 7.4 GW (from 7.1 GW) and Installed Capacity to 1.4 GW (from 1.3 GW). Our Secured Capacity stood at 2.9 GW.

We reached a number of significant milestones in the expansion and development of our Green Capacities Portfolio, including the following:

- we, together with our partner CIP, won the second seabed site (Liivi 1) in the Estonian offshore wind tender and see the site as a natural extension of the Liivi 2 sea area (secured in December 2023);

- Silesia WF I (50 MW) in Poland has reached COD;

- we have secured grid capacity for the first BESS projects (<190 MW) in Lithuania;

- we have submitted a bid in the tender for the second 700 MW Lithuanian offshore wind project. However, due to the limited number of participants, the tender did not convene but is expected to take place in due course, following a review of the tender conditions.

In Networks, the total number of installed smart meters has exceeded 836 thousand.

In Customers & Solutions, we continue to expand the EV charging network in the Baltics, with multiple locations secured for the installation of 67 EV charging points.

Sustainability

Our Green Share of Generation decreased by 15.7 pp to 79.9% YoY due to proportionally higher electricity generation at CCGT (Reserve Capacities).

We reduced our GHG emissions by 60.4% in Scope 2, while our Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions compared to 3M 2023 increased by 49.4% and 5.5% respectively. Total emissions amounted to 1.61 million t CO-eq and increased by 12.5% YoY.

Carbon intensity of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions decreased by 33.8% YoY to 220 g CO-eq/kWh due to higher electricity production from renewables and reduction of Scope 2 emissions.

No fatal accidents were recorded, and employee Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) was 0.99, contractor TRIR - 0, both well below the targeted threshold. eNPS remained high at 65.5%.

Shareholder returns and 2024 outlook

In line with our Dividend Policy, a dividend of EUR 0.643 per share, corresponding to EUR 46.5 million, was distributed for H2 2023.

The Group remains focused on its ambitious strategy execution with a purpose to create a 100% green and secure energy ecosystem.

This includes expanding Group's Green Capacities Portfolio and growing Investments to deliver 4-5 GW of Installed Capacity by 2030, thus strengthening its contribution to Europe's decarbonisation and energy security in the region.

As a renewables-focused integrated utility, we focus on green generation and green flexibility technologies, including onshore and offshore wind, battery energy storage system (BESS), pumped-storage hydro and power-to-X.

We utilise our integrated business model and benefit from the largest customer portfolio, energy storage facility, and network in the Baltics.

To deliver on the ambitious goals in the Green Capacities and Networks segments, the Group plans to invest EUR 3.0-4.0 billion over the 2024-2027 period. This represents an increase of around EUR 1 billion compared to the previous strategic period, underscoring our commitment to a sustainable future.

Highlights of the strategic plan

We plan to double the Installed Green Capacities, reaching a total of 2.4-2.6 GW in 2027 compared to 1.3 GW in 2023. Currently, the Group's Green Capacities Portfolio amounts to 7.4 GW, of which 2.9 GW is Secured Capacity.

We aim building at least 2 offshore wind projects in the Baltics: one project in Lithuania (COD ~2030), and at least one more project in the Baltics (COD post 2030). We seek to reach at least 700 MW of onshore wind capacity installed by 2027 in the Baltics and Poland.

We keep a focus on the development of green flexibility technologies: pumped-storage hydro expansion by 2026 (by adding 110 MW to the currently existing 900 MW); we are targeting to develop commercial-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) by 2027 and implement a green hydrogen and e-fuel production pilot project.

We strive to further expand our customer portfolio to enable the Green Capacities build-out.

Our growing customer portfolio and focus on green electricity supply should lead to a significant increase in the amount of supplied electricity by the Group, from 6.7 TWh in 2023 to 9.0-11.0 TWh by 2027.

We plan to connect the growing number of new customers to the distribution network and to expand the capacity of electricity distribution network in order to enable a green transition and to meet growing demand related to electrification.

The Group is building a leading EV public charging network in the Baltics. We aim to expand across public, commercial, and home charging segments and focus on developing EV fast-charging network while being the first-choice charging solutions provider for the home and business customers.

To accelerate the green electrification in the Baltics and Poland, the Group is expanding its renewable organisation and is expecting to increase the number of employees at Ignitis Renewables 3.5 times by 2027.

Financial targets

In 2024-2027, we plan to invest EUR 3.0-4.0 billion with over 85-90% of the investments to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy.

We plan to direct EUR 1.8-2.4 billion (around 61% of the Investments) to further develop green generation and green flexibility technologies and double the installed Green Capacities. More than half of the Green Capacities Investments over the 2024-2027 period relate to new Installed Green Capacities additions after 2027.

We are planning to direct EUR 1.1-1.3 billion or one third of our Investments towards the expansion of a resilient and efficient electricity distribution network, which is one of key elements of a successful energy transition.

We are expecting the Group's Adjusted EBITDA in 2027 to be within the range of EUR 550-650 million compared to EUR 484.7 million in 2023. The average Adjusted ROCE is projected to reach 6.5-7.5% in 2024-2027.

We expect to maintain our credit rating of 'BBB' and above over the 2024-2027 period. We will continue our investment programme while maintaining net debt to EBITDA below 5 times.

We are committed to a at least 3% annual dividend growth, representing a 7.3-8.0% implied dividend yield in the 2024-2027 period.

Sustainability priorities and targets

We aim to reach net zero emissions by 2040-2050 and expect over 85-90% of our total Investments to be aligned with the EU Taxonomy in the period 2024-2027. We aim to achieve the sustainable share of Adjusted EBITDA of at least 70-75% by 2027.

We will maximise sustainable value by directing our Investments toward a decarbonisation pathway that is aligned with our business ambitions and reaching net zero emissions by 2040-2050. Our sustainability-related priority is reducing the carbon intensity of scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions (by ~20-40% in 2027 vs. 2023) by growing Installed Green Capacities and increasing the share of green electricity used for our operations.

We strive to grow the share of green electricity we supply (over 30% by 2027 compared to 17% in 2023).

We keep a strong strategic focus on occupational health and safety, employee experience, well-being, and diversity.

Long-term performance objectives

Following the Strategic Plan, the Supervisory Board of Ignitis Group approved the long-term objectives and performance targets for the 2024-2027 period that determine a long-term variable part of remuneration for key executives.

Details of the Long-Term Incentive Plan objectives for the 2024-2027 period are available in the Strategic Plan's annexes and on our website (link).

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) expects output in its regions to grow by three per cent in 2024, up from 2.5 per cent in 2023, despite challenges stemming from global geopolitical tensions, including growing limitations on trade, according to its latest Regional Economic Prospects report published this week.

Growth in the Bank's regions is projected to pick up further in 2025, to 3.6 per cent.

The new report, Taming Inflation, showcases an easing of inflationary pressures relative to last year, which was marked by economic slowdown due to high energy prices resulting from the war on Ukraine and post-Covid recovery.

While growth is expected to accelerate, the forecast is slightly below last September's projections, with a downward revision of 0.2 percentage points. This is partly due to slower-than-expected growth in early 2024 across central Europe and the Baltic states, echoing Germany's sluggish economic performance.

Southern and eastern Mediterranean economies face weak growth as a result of the spillovers from the war in Gaza and reduced fiscal stimulus in Egypt, while Central Asia's growth contributions from intermediated trade are levelling off, and are expected to be more modest in the future. A booming ICT sector, however, is seeing unprecedented levels of high growth.

As energy and food prices moderated since 2022, inflation in the EBRD regions fell to an average of 6.3 per cent in March 2024 from a peak of 17.5 per cent in October 2022. While this drop was quicker than expected a year ago, inflation remains two percentage points above pre-pandemic levels. This pattern mirrors trends in advanced economies, where inflation has declined but remains above central banks' targets.

The forecast notes slower disinflation in EBRD countries with larger budget deficits and weaker macroeconomic frameworks.

""While disinflation has been faster than expected, inflation in some of our countries remains high,"" says Beata Javorcik, the EBRD's Chief Economist.

""The outlook is subject to significant risks, particularly from the escalation of geopolitical tensions and its unwanted economic effects. While the current shifts in trade and investment relationships may benefit some individual economies, let's not forget that globally, geopolitical fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and higher volatility.""

The report describes how geopolitical tensions are impacting the Bank's economies, leading to rapid fragmentation in trade and increased defence spending, while eroding the peace dividend -- the economic benefit resulting from a reduction in defence expenditure and a subsequent reinvestment of funds in the civilian economy.

Since February 2022, arms trade as a share of imports and exports of the European Union economies in the EBRD regions increased from 0.1 per cent to 0.3-0.5 per cent. Countries are increasingly trading certain goods only with certain partners. ""Bridging"" economies which trade with both eastern and western blocs have been large recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) and stand to benefit from fragmentation.

Inward FDI from China to the EBRD regions picked up sharply in 2023. Similarly, investment from Russia to Central Asia has been rising, particularly in logistics services.

Geopolitical pressures are also reflected in the elevated borrowing costs observed in the EBRD countries in the EU. The median yield on five-year government bonds increased by three percentage points from early 2022 to April 2024 across the Bank's regions.

May 2024 marks the 20th anniversary of the EU accession of eight economies where the EBRD invests: Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.

Over the past two decades, these countries have experienced significant growth in their per capita incomes, transitioning from being only about a quarter as affluent as Germany in 2003 to achieving half its GDP per capita by 2023.

This was faster than the speed with which other emerging markets at similar levels of development were converging with advanced economies. The swift convergence can be largely attributed to the ""EU accession bonus"", which was facilitated by rapid growth of exports relative to GDP as these economies integrated more deeply with the European and global supply chains.

The growth outlook in Central Europe and the Baltic states is expected to gradually improve, with 2024 projections being at 2.2 per cent and accelerating further to 3.1 per cent in 2025. Yet, growth forecasts in several economies have been revised down since September 2023 due to weak economic activity in recent months.

In the EBRD countries in the south-eastern EU, GDP growth is projected to pick up from two per cent in 2023 to 2.8 per cent in 2024, supported by accommodative fiscal stances and robust real wage growth.

Similarly, the Western Balkans region expects growth to increase to 3.3 per cent in 2024 from 2.5 per cent last year.

Central Asia is expected to face a slight decline in growth from 5.7 per cent in 2023 to 5.4 per cent in 2024, as intermediated trade with Russia appears to have reached a plateau, while spring floods weigh on Kazakhstan's growth prospects. However, a rebound is expected in 2025, to 5.9 per cent.

Growth in the Caucasus is forecast to be moderate at 4.1 per cent in 2024 before settling closer to 3.5 per cent in 2025, a level in line with estimates of medium-term potential growth.

Ukraine's output expansion meanwhile is expected to be held back in 2024 due to significant recent damage to electricity infrastructure. Limited domestic demand, labour shortages and insufficient investments will also likely constrain growth prospects, the report says.

However, a recovery of exports and the expansion of domestic military production will likely generate economic growth of three per cent in 2024 accelerating to six per cent in 2025.

The EBRD's report notes that the Caucasus and Central Asia have seen an uptick in ICT, in large part a result of highly skilled Russian professionals choosing to relocate to the Caucasus and Central Asia, taking advantage of linguistic and cultural proximity and the relative ease of gaining residence and opening bank accounts.

Russian relocanty include large numbers of entrepreneurs, as well as experienced IT and creative industry personnel. For instance, Georgia is estimated to have received more than 20,000 Russian tech professionals and more than 21,000 legal entities (firms) were established by Russian entrepreneurs between March 2022 and July 2023.

Kazakhstan has seen a doubling in the number of entities with Russian participation (19,000 firms as of October 2023 compared with around 8,000 in 2021), driven by a fivefold increase in ICT businesses. Armenia has seen a doubling in the number of ICT sector employees in 2022, with some multinational corporations, such as Nvidia, moving whole teams from Russia and opening research and development centres in Yerevan.

Caucasus and Central Asian economies introduced comprehensive ""absorption"" packages targeted at these professionals, including generous tax benefits, streamlined work permitting procedures and relocation support for companies and individuals registered with specially designated economic zones, such as the Astana Hub in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan's IT Park and Kyrgyzstan's High Technology Park.

As a result, the ICT sectors have been developing rapidly. For instance, Kyrgyzstan's High Technology Park's revenues increased by 70 per cent between 2022 and 2023 (95 per cent of its revenue come from ICT exports). The number of (local and foreign) companies registered with the park increased from 228 in 2022 to 383 in 2023.

IT exports by Uzbekistan's IT Park increased 2.4-fold relative to 2022, while Astana Hub's IT exports increased by 84 per cent year on year in 2023. With significant real estate at its disposal, Uzbekistan's IT Park introduced a new ""Zero Risk"" programme granting participating companies free office space for one year, assistance with office equipment, and partial reimbursement of local personnel salary and training costs (effectively amounting to a negative income tax).

These countries are already members of the European Union and the NATO, thus they play an important role in the politics and development of the Eastern European region, not only due to their presence on the Baltic Sea, but also because of their territorial proximity to Russia . Current projects such as Rail Baltica and Via Baltica are crucial to improve connectivity and to bring this area closer to the European Union, as well as to help them grow and continue to strengthen their economic resilience.

In a constantly evolving geopolitical scenario of Eastern Europe, the Three Seas Initiative comes as a great opportunity to stimulate projects of innovation and change that can lead to a series of benefits to the Baltic nations (Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia). Running through the North - South axis of Europe and understanding 13 countries, the Three Seas Initiative aims to boost progress and collaboration in the three main fields of electricity, digitalization, and transport, which would lead to a general economic growth and energy independence of the region. Especially for the Baltic countries, which have historically dealt with infrastructural challenges and geopolitical complexities, the Three Seas Initiative represents a way to support their interests on an international stage and thus shape both their future and the region.

One of the key projects supported by the Three Seas Initiative is the Rail Baltica, a rail transport infrastructure with the goal to integrate the Baltic States with the European rail network. The project includes five EU countries, starting in Finland in the capital city of Helsinki, the railway will provide a continuous rail link from Tallinn (Estonia) to Warsaw (Poland), passing by Riga (Latvia), Kaunas and Vilnius (Lithuania), as well as other major cities for a total of 870 km. 213 km of the railway runs in Estonia, 265 km in Latvia and 392 km in Lithuania. Being the largest Baltic region infrastructural project of the last century, it is also one of the main priorities of the EU that recognizes the need to create the link of the North Sea Baltic Corridor as part of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) ) ) ) ). In fact, rail networks in the Baltic States are mainly in Russian gauge, being built in the second half of the 19th century, while they were part of the Russian empire. The difficulties to interconnect the Baltics with the EU via Poland led to a major connection to the West - East axis and so to the most of freight rail traffic being imported from the CIS countries, mainly Russia. With a 10-year construction period, the objective is to conclude the project by 2030. Rail Baltica is also aimed to be environmentally friendly. That is why it will be fully electrified, with attention to the materials and technologies in order to avoid environmentally sensitive protected areas. Moreover, where needed, noise protection barriers and special animal passages will be built. The creation of this project is financed partly by the states of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and from the EU. Up to 85% of the total cost is indeed founded by the CEF (Connecting Europe Facility) which is a key EU funding instrument. The total estimated construction cost is around 5.8 billion Euros, and the estimated socio-economic benefits are estimated to be 16.2 billion Euros (according to a study of Ernst & Young). This is an interesting project that will have a paramount impact on the lives of many and will unlock new trails of trade, investment, development, and tourism for the Baltic countries.

Another key project in the ambition of transportation of primary importance is the Via Baltica, which starts from Warsaw in Poland and leads to Tallinn in Estonia. Covering 970 km is one of the most important transit arteries in the Eastern Europe, it is also as a matter of fact the only transport corridor in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia for the transportation of goods in the North - South axis. At the same time, the existing road infrastructure and the traffic conditions do not guarantee a high traffic level and safety. There are neither pedestrian or bicycle roads and tunnels, nor safe parking spots, animal fences and noise. Therefore, the aim of this project is not only to modernize the road core network, but also to meet safety and environmental standards and targets. The objective is to fulfill the EU's transport policy, road safety and to implement, one day, the Vision Zero concept. Thus, it is comprehensible that Via Baltica is crucial for the economic vitality and strategic resilience of the region, generating trade flows, tourism, and interregional cooperation.

A different project, but not less, in the field of electricity important is ""The integration and synchronization of the Baltic States' electricity system with the European network"" which will guarantee security of electricity supply to the three countries and will integrate them with the European energy market. The Baltic States are connected to the IPS/UPS (Integrated Power System/United Power System), the electricity system with Belarus and Russia, under the so called BRELL agreement, since the end of the Soviet Period. Therefore, it's clear that this put Russia in a position of strength due to its control over the power grid of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia that might be consequently victims of the use of energy supply as a coercion policy. For this reason, in the previous years the Baltics already ended the Russian gas monopoly. Now they aim to continue to follow a goal of energy independence and synchronization with continental Europe, remove third country impact, ensure security, encourage market integration and realize the vision of a fully integrated European energy market, confirmed by the current geopolitical landscape. The synchronization with European network is planned for February 2025.

To conclude, from a first vision of only some of the projects which the Three Seas Initiative promotes, it is incontestable that the participation in the initiative is positive for the Baltic states, which through appropriate investments in infrastructure and connectivity will experience economic growth. Committing in regional cooperation will benefit their geopolitical position and bring more security, growing along the Three Seas Initiative to achieve progress and resilience for Eastern Europe.

However, the initiative still has to overcome several energy challenges such as upgrading the outdated infrastructure, ensuring a fair and inclusive transition to a low-carbon economy, harmonizing the legal frameworks among the member states, and meeting the EU's high climate standards. During the political transition, these countries prioritized economic and political reforms over energy challenges. In the 1990s, only the Western countries, thus those outside the Eastern bloc, made significant progress in the energy sector. The production of a unit of GDP in many countries of the Three Seas Initiative has been more costly than in Western Europe. Therefore, these states are striving to align their economic and energy policies with the EU standards.

The Three Seas region is a group of countries that vary in geography, climate, economy, and economic resources. Each of them uses different sources of energy and emits different amounts of greenhouse gases. To show how diverse the Three Seas region is, let us look at some of the countries in this group. Lithuania relies mainly on gas, biofuels, and renewables, and seeks to diversify its energy sources. It has no intention to build nuclear plants shortly, though. Similarly, Estonia's parliament adopted a renewable electricity target of 100 percent by 2030. Contrary to what it may seem, Hungary's energy system has a relatively low carbon intensity. The country relies on coal for only about a dozen or so of its energy mix. State authorities plan to increase their use of renewable energy sources and invest in new nuclear reactors at the Paks power plant. Hungary increased its solar power capacity by nearly 1 gigawatt in 2022. The Czech Republic is also phasing out coal and expanding its nuclear energy sector to secure its energy independence.

The Three Seas countries and other Central and Eastern European nations are undergoing a fast energy transition, driven by the EU's stricter climate policy. Diversifying energy sources became more important after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. As the Kremlin's influence in the region has weakened over the past two years, energy prices have risen, especially for fossil fuels that were once largely imported from the east. One thing is certain: the region is undergoing a transformation that will involve reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

The region has a lot of scope for developing renewable technologies, even though coal and gas have been and still are the main sources of energy for many of its economies. Offshore wind power plants are very feasible for the countries on the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Northern countries like Poland and the Baltic states can invest in both offshore and onshore energy, even though they use different types of energy sources. Conversely, countries like Slovenia, Romania, and Hungary, which are situated in the central-southern region of the Three Seas, are known for their significant potential in producing solar energy. The advancement of renewable energy sources is crucial for the Three Seas Initiative because it can help mitigate the continuous increase in energy costs. In the journey of energy transition, particularly for economies heavily reliant on coal, gas serves as an excellent bridge fuel. This is evident from the investments made by countries in the region, such as the doubling of the LNG terminal capacity in Croatia, the construction of the FSRU terminal near Gdańsk, and the expansion of the Polish LNG terminal's capacity from 5 to 8.3 billion cubic meters annually.

Without a doubt, the year 2030 will be a significant milestone for Europe in terms of both political and climate-related developments. In the political sphere, there is a growing discussion within the EU forum about plans to extend the union by incorporating a country from the Western Balkans. In terms of climate and energy policies, 2030 marks the completion of certain frameworks established by the European Union. Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that within a strict framework, certain countries may struggle to meet their individual objectives. Indeed, if we expand our view beyond just the Three Seas countries, and if the economic and energy development in Central and Eastern Europe continues at its current pace, with transformations that are equitable and customized to each economy, we could anticipate a significant increase in the capacity of wind and solar power plants in this region. The capacity could rise from the current 35 gigawatts to 196 gigawatts by 2030. This increase could potentially reduce energy prices by up to a third and enable the export of up to 20 gigawatts of electricity post-2030. In 2022 alone, the total capacity of solar and wind power plants in Central and Eastern Europe saw an increase of less than 30 percent. This suggests a potential for this trend to continue, further contributing to the region's energy development and transformation.

There is a clear political desire for transformation within the energy sector in the countries involved in the Three Seas Initiative. It is important to note that in the Central and Eastern European region, political support is significantly influenced by energy prices. This, in turn, affects the stance of individual governments towards investments in the energy sector. The Baltic states have set a goal to disconnect their energy systems from the Russian grid by 2025. Following this, they plan to subsequently connect to the continental European grid. Indeed, Latvia and Estonia are also participating in the development of offshore wind farms. Another noteworthy example is the collaboration between Hungary and Romania, along with Azerbaijan and Georgia. They have signed a memorandum to develop an underwater electric cable that will run through the Black Sea. The investment is intended to bolster the export of energy to Europe. Hungary is a country that has significant geothermal potential. As a testament to this, the first geothermal power plant was connected to their national grid in late 2017. An excellent illustration of future collaboration is the proposal by Romania and Bulgaria to construct a shared energy island. For Poland, which has an economy heavily reliant on coal, there have been numerous investments and strategies developed in recent years. The goal of these initiatives is to attain energy independence and ensure a stable supply of natural gas to the Central and Eastern Europe region. Several significant projects stand out, including the Baltic Pipe, the enlargement of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście, the introduction of a new FSRU terminal, the development of nuclear reactors in collaboration with the United States and South Korea, and the implementation of small modular reactors (SMRs).

The success of the energy transition not only relies on top-down decisions but also significantly depends on the collaborative efforts of the private sector, the public sector, and the general public. An excellent illustration of public involvement is the widespread support for the ""My Electricity"" government program in Poland. The initiative aimed to offer a co-funding sum of as much as PLN 5,000 for the setup of solar panel systems in domestic houses. The considerable interest shown by the beneficiaries led to the construction of close to 10 gigawatts of photovoltaic energy between 2020 and 2023.

The partnership within the Three Seas Initiative is consistently progressing and it is undeniably a framework that deserves consideration, especially in the light of the current geopolitical system. Moving forward, the significance of investments in interconnectors cannot be overstated. Such investments will facilitate the delivery of electricity, produced from offshore wind energy at sea, to areas of demand. This calls for, among other initiatives, the deployment of bridging systems and the expansion of cross-border networks to harness the advantages. In addition, the transition of many countries to nuclear energy can benefit others. This is because nuclear power stations in a particular country can have a substantial impact on the regional energy composition, especially through grid interconnections.",warsawinstitute.org,news,Warsaw Institute,,0.3098039215686275,453371692,13,https://warsawinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zrzut-ekranu-2024-05-10-172717.png,eng-9562835

The development of new network facilities will raise energy security, guarantee reliable electric power transmission, ensure stable system operations and support the rapid development of renewable energy sources.

The electricity transmission grid development projects in Northwestern Lithuania include the construction of two 330 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines (Darbenai-Varduva-Musa and Panevezys-Musa), building the 330 kV Varduva transformer substation and the installation of shunt reactors at the Darbenai and Musa switchyard stations.

""The new 330 kV transmission lines from Darbenai to Panevezys are important for the development of renewable energy,"" said Litgrid CEO Rokas Masiulis. ""[They will provide] an additional electricity highway between Western Lithuania, where renewable energy is rapidly developing and offshore wind farms are planned, and Eastern Lithuania, where electricity consumption is growing [at the highest rate].""

""With the rapid development of renewable energy sources, solar and wind farm electric power production is constantly increasing on the grid. Changes in renewable energy production lead to a redistribution of electricity flows with more wind generation being connected to the grid in Western Lithuania and more solar power in Eastern Lithuania,"" added Mr Masiulis, a former Minister of Transport and Communication (2016-2019) and Minister of Energy (2014-2016). ""As renewable integration in Northwest Lithuania continues to grow, it is essential to ensure the reliability of electricity transmission in the 330 kV grid.""

An important Lithuanian energy hub, the 330 kV Darbenai switchyard will distribute future offshore wind farm electricity across the country along the transmission lines of Western Lithuania. The new Northwestern transmission lines from Darbenai to Panevezys will increase grid reliability and facilitate the integration of a new Latvian interconnector.

The construction of the new infrastructure will help maintain the reliable operation of the Lithuanian energy system even during the synchronisation with the continental European power grids and will support the development of local electric power generation from renewable energy sources.

2024.05.10

On May 10, Lithuania's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gabrielius Landsbergis, met with Latvia's new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Baiba Braže, in Vilnius. The Foreign Ministers discussed the region's geopolitical situation, the need to increase military support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's war of aggression, the accountability of the aggressor Russia and its accomplice Belarus, and infrastructure projects.

""The neighbourhood links Lithuania and Latvia, the closest possible cooperation within NATO and the European Union, and a close friendship. We share a Baltic identity, history, a common assessment of today's geopolitical challenges and a very similar approach to what and how we need to do to overcome them,"" said Landsbergis, welcoming his counterpart who chose Lithuania for one of his first visits.

According to the head of Lithuania's diplomacy, current security challenges and threats help to further strengthen bilateral and regional cooperation between the eight Nordic and Baltic countries. Landsbergis noted that the Baltic states were leaders among Ukraine's supporters and worked together to ensure that other countries, especially large and economically capable countries, would contribute significantly to Ukraine's victory.

""Ukraine's victory over the aggressor Russia is a prerequisite for the return of peace to the European continent. For this, Ukraine needs to receive much more military support and air defence systems, and we need to take significant steps towards Ukraine's membership in the EU and NATO. Ukraine's place is in the European and Euro-Atlantic family, and it is eagerly awaited,"" Landsbergis said.

The Foreign Ministers discussed the latest manifestations of Russia's aggression - diversion operations - and insisted that they had a common understanding: it is necessary to act decisively to prevent these attacks and impose sanctions on persons executing the operations or otherwise involved in them.

""Russia poses the biggest direct, long-term threat. Together with our partners, we must intensify our work on devising a comprehensive strategy to deter Russia, create strategic dilemmas for it, impose new tight sanctions, prevent their circumvention, and strengthen the international isolation of Russia and Belarus,"" Landsbergis said.

Landsbergis noted that today, the so-called Core Group was meeting in Vilnius to create a special international tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression against Ukraine.

At the meeting, the Foreign Ministers also discussed infrastructure projects -- the synchronisation of the Baltic states' electricity grid with the Continental European Network, the development of the International North-South Transport Corridor, and the final transition to European standards to ensure the integrity of the region, defence mobility, and business interests.

Braže is a professional diplomat who previously worked in the Latvian diplomatic service and NATO structures and was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia on April 19, 2024, after the resignation of the former Foreign Minister Krišjānis Kariņš.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,0.3333333333333333,453115245,18,,eng-9554746

However, the initiative still has to overcome several energy challenges such as upgrading the outdated infrastructure, ensuring a fair and inclusive transition to a low-carbon economy, harmonizing the legal frameworks among the member states, and meeting the EU's high climate standards. During the political transition, these countries prioritized economic and political reforms over energy challenges. In the 1990s, only the Western countries, thus those outside the Eastern bloc, made significant progress in the energy sector. The production of a unit of GDP in many countries of the Three Seas Initiative has been more costly than in Western Europe. Therefore, these states are striving to align their economic and energy policies with the EU standards.

The Three Seas region is a group of countries that vary in geography, climate, economy, and economic resources. Each of them uses different sources of energy and emits different amounts of greenhouse gases. To show how diverse the Three Seas region is, let us look at some of the countries in this group. Lithuania relies mainly on gas, biofuels, and renewables, and seeks to diversify its energy sources. It has no intention to build nuclear plants shortly, though. similarly, Estonia's parliament adopted a renewable electricity target of 100 percent by 2030. Contrary to what it may seem, Hungary's energy system has a relatively low carbon intensity. The country relies on coal for only about a dozen or so of its energy mix. State plan authorities to increase their use of renewable energy sources and invest in new nuclear reactors at the Paks power plant. Hungary increased its solar power capacity by nearly 1 gigawatt in 2022. The Czech Republic is also phasing out coal and expanding its nuclear energy sector to secure its energy independence.

The Three Seas countries and other Central and Eastern European nations are undergoing a fast energy transition, driven by the EU's stricter climate policy. Diversifying energy sources became more important after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. As the Kremlin's influence in the region has weakened over the past two years, energy prices have risen, especially for fossil fuels that were once largely imported from the east. One thing is certain: the region is undergoing a transformation that will involve reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

The region has a lot of scope for developing renewable technologies, even though coal and gas have been and are still the main sources of energy for many of its economies. Offshore wind power plants are very feasible for the countries on the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Northern countries like Poland and the Baltic states can invest in both offshore and onshore energy, even though they use different types of energy sources. Conversely, countries like Slovenia, Romania, and Hungary, which are situated in the central-southern region of the Three Seas, are known for their significant potential in producing solar energy. The advancement of renewable energy sources is crucial for the Three Seas Initiative because it can help mitigate the continuous increase in energy costs. In the journey of energy transition, particularly for economies heavily reliant on coal, gas serves as an excellent bridge fuel. This is evident from the investments made by countries in the region, such as the doubling of the LNG terminal capacity in Croatia, the construction of the FSRU terminal near Gdańsk, and the expansion of the Polish LNG terminal's capacity from 5 to 8.3 billion cubic meters annually.

Without a doubt, the year 2030 will be a significant milestone for Europe in terms of both political and climate-related developments. In the political sphere, there is a growing discussion within the EU forum about plans to extend the union by incorporating a country from the Western Balkans. In terms of climate and energy policies, 2030 marks the completion of certain frameworks established by the European Union. Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that within a strict framework, certain countries may struggle to meet their individual objectives. Indeed, if we expand our view beyond just the Three Seas countries, and if the economic and energy development in Central and Eastern Europe continues at its current pace, with transformations that are equitable and customized to each economy, we could anticipate a significant increase in the capacity of wind and solar power plants in this region. The capacity could rise from the current 35 gigawatts to 196 gigawatts by 2030. This increase could potentially reduce energy prices by up to a third and enable the export of up to 20 gigawatts of electricity post-2030. In 2022 alone, the total capacity of solar and wind power plants in Central and Eastern Europe saw an increase of less than 30 percent. This suggests a potential for this trend to continue, further contributing to the region's energy development and transformation.

There is a clear political desire for transformation within the energy sector in the countries involved in the Three Seas Initiative. It is important to note that in the Central and Eastern European region, political support is significantly influenced by energy prices. This, in turn, affects the stance of individual governments towards investments in the energy sector. The Baltic states have set a goal to disconnect their energy systems from the Russian grid by 2025. Following this, they plan to subsequently connect to the continental European grid. Indeed, Latvia and Estonia are also participating in the development of offshore wind farms. Another noteworthy example is the collaboration between Hungary and Romania, along with Azerbaijan and Georgia. They have signed a memorandum to develop an underwater electric cable that will run through the Black Sea. The investment is intended to bolster the export of energy to Europe. Hungary is a country that has significant geothermal potential. As a testament to this, the first geothermal power plant was connected to their national grid in late 2017. An excellent illustration of future collaboration is the proposal by Romania and Bulgaria to construct a shared energy island. For Poland, which has an economy heavily reliant on coal, there have been numerous investments and strategies developed in recent years. The goal of these initiatives is to achieve energy independence and ensure a stable supply of natural gas to the Central and Eastern Europe region. Several significant projects stand out, including the Baltic Pipe, the enlargement of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście, the introduction of a new FSRU terminal, the development of nuclear reactors in collaboration with the United States and South Korea, and the implementation of small modular reactors (SMRs).

The success of the energy transition not only relies on top-down decisions but also significantly depends on the collaborative efforts of the private sector, the public sector, and the general public. An excellent illustration of public involvement is the widespread support for the ""My Electricity"" government program in Poland. The initiative aimed to offer a co-funding sum of as much as PLN 5,000 for the setup of solar panel systems in domestic houses. The considerable interest shown by the beneficiaries led to the construction of close to 10 gigawatts of photovoltaic energy between 2020 and 2023.

The partnership within the Three Seas Initiative is consistently progressing and it is undeniably a framework that deserves consideration, especially in the light of the current geopolitical system. Moving forward, the significance of investments in interconnectors cannot be overstated. Such investments will facilitate the delivery of electricity, produced from offshore wind energy at sea, to areas of demand. This calls for, among other initiatives, the deployment of bridging systems and the expansion of cross-border networks to harness the advantages. In addition, the transition of many countries to nuclear energy can benefit others. This is because nuclear power stations in a particular country can have a substantial impact on the regional energy composition, especially through grid interconnections.

The logistics centre is built to serve the volumes of goods of the companies of TKM Group, primarily serving the cargo volumes of Selver, one of the largest retail store chains in Estonia, in its initial phase. Spanning a total area of 17,200 m², the new centre is planned to be completed in autumn 2024.

The centre will be a modern building with an energy class of A and built in accordance with the requirements of the BREEAM ""Excellent"" certificate. A solar park will be built on the roof of the logistics centre, which will cover a significant part of the building's electricity consumption.

The chosen location is well connected to major transport hubs, and the nearly 5-hectare plot will also allow for the future expansion of the building.

""NIB's financing to TKM Grupp aligns with our strategy to expand private sector lending in the Baltics. The new logistics center in Maardu will significantly increase efficiency and business opportunities. This will enhance grocery market competition, and ultimately, benefit Estonian households,"" says André Küüsvek, NIB President and CEO.

""We are honored to start cooperation with such respected international financial institution as NIB, and to meet its requirements in terms of project goals and business standards. From the very beginning, our goal has been to build a modern and sustainable logistics centre building,"" says Peeter Kütt, CEO of TKM Kinnisvara AS.

TKM Kinnisvara is part of the TKM Grupp (formerly Tallinna Kaubamaja Grupp), one of the biggest retail companies in Estonia accounting for approx. 10% of all retail trade in Estonia. TKM Grupp is part of a larger group, NG Investeeringud.

NIB is an international financial institution owned by eight member countries: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden. The Bank finances private and public projects in and outside the member countries.

The Company maintained stable revenue and profit performance, and achieved significant results in network modernisation projects. Employee and customer satisfaction with the Company and its services improved during the year. The Company continues to present itself as a reliable and responsible company that plays an important role in ensuring the energy security of Lithuania and the entire Baltic region.

Last year, despite the complicated geopolitical situation and high gas prices at the start of this year, Amber Grid successfully ensured uninterrupted gas supply to all its customers. The Company made further investments in the modernisation and development of the gas transmission system: during the year, upgraded five gas distribution stations and other gas transmission system facilities, as well as implemented the reconstruction of sections in the Vilnius-Kaunas gas pipeline.

The environment and climate change reduction remains the area of particular attention in the Company. In 2023, the Company's solar power plants generated even more electricity from renewable sources, and its car fleet was upgraded by replacing polluting cars with electric or hybrid vehicles. In addition, the Company approved future plans to switch the existing gas compressor from gas to electric.

Although a gas pipeline incident in Pasvalys district marked the beginning of the year, the Company and its customers did not suffer significant losses. On the contrary, internal diagnostics of gas pipelines were improved, and around 600 km of gas pipelines across Lithuania were tested. The Company also held the campaign to raise public awareness for safety at gas pipelines.

Amber Grid will continue to pursue its goals outlined in the Strategy: to ensure reliable and secure gas supply, to increase the diversification of gas supply and to actively contribute to the development of green energy by participating in the implementation of green hydrogen and other renewable gas projects. I am grateful to my colleagues for a successful past year and wish Amber Grid sustainable growth, strengthening the Baltic energy sector and creating benefits for Lithuania in the dynamically changing energy sector.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.4588235294117646,453025843,9,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

On the morning of 8 May, Russian troops attacked energy infrastructure in six regions. Gas infrastructure in the west of the country was also damaged.

After Russia's shelling, Ukraine's power system can be compared to Swiss cheese - it's full of holes. According to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, we have already lost 8 GW of generation, which is a huge figure for any power system. He estimates the losses in recent weeks alone at more than $1 billion. It is noteworthy that the enemy has focused on destroying shunting generation, i.e. power plants that usually operate only when there is a high demand for electricity - peak demand.

Ukraine is currently actively cooperating with European countries that are helping to provide equipment for the restoration of power facilities. First of all, we are talking about the Baltic countries - Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. For example, the Lithuanian Ministry of Energy has offered to dismantle its closed thermal power plants for spare parts for the Ukrainian power system.

About 50% of the Ukrainian power grid's facilities need to be repaired.

What cannot be repaired will have to be rebuilt from scratch. For example, the Trypillia TPP in the Kyiv region, which was completely destroyed by the Russians during a massive missile attack on the night of 11 April. Prior to that, on 22 March, the enemy completely destroyed Zmiivska TPP in the Kharkiv region. Restoration of such facilities requires hundreds of millions of dollars. However, the most valuable resource in this situation is time, as we are talking about years.

The needs of electricity consumers are currently covered by own generation, imports and emergency assistance. In addition, favourable weather conditions allow the power system to be balanced by renewable energy sources, primarily solar power plants.

""In summer, there is a certain increase in electricity consumption. Perhaps it will be an increase of 20-30%. In general, these daytime peaks will be covered by an increase in electricity generation from renewable sources. Therefore, we do not expect any critical situation. However, the issue of economic consumption will remain relevant,"" says Ruslan Slobodian, Head of the State Agency for Energy Supervision.

Will there be a blackout in the summer?

The power shortage in Ukraine's energy system will be felt for many months to come. And, according to Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, even the maximum imports may not be enough to balance the system at some point in time.

A total blackout is the worst-case scenario for any power system. It cannot be ruled out completely, but such a scenario is currently unlikely.

On the other hand, with almost every Ukrainian thermal power plant damaged, it is difficult to do without scheduled power outages. However, it remains to be seen how widespread they will be.

All available forecasts and calculations are based on the current situation. It could deteriorate significantly in the event of new attacks on critical infrastructure. However, even under such conditions, Halushchenko emphasises that there will be no total blackout.

""Unfortunately, there is no doubt that [Russian strikes] will continue. There are a lot of experts now, and everyone knows that tomorrow there will be a blackout and a total catastrophe. It's all a lie and a falsehood. There will be no total blackout in the country,"" he says.

At the same time, the Minister calls on Ukrainians to prepare for different scenarios:

""It is better to be prepared for any scenario. But the energy sector is doing everything to ensure that these scenarios never materialise. And as the experience of last year shows, we have kept our word.""

Scheduled outages: when will they happen?

Kudrytskyi says that power restrictions are a last-resort measure that power companies can use to maintain the power system. However, they are already used primarily for business.

In Ukraine, there is a problem not only with generation but also with the ability to transmit electricity due to the constant shelling of substations. That is why restrictions are being imposed on industrial consumers in many regions. The only exceptions are the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, where restrictions also affect household consumers. These regions are currently facing the worst electricity situation.

Businesses are mostly restricted in the evening during peak hours, when electricity consumption increases, as there are generally no problems during the day. At the same time, the limits do not apply to the defence industry and critical infrastructure facilities, such as hospitals.

In general, the most difficult period, according to forecasts, will be July-August. This is because, firstly, electricity consumption always increases during this time due to hot weather, and, secondly, NPP and TPP units are scheduled to be taken out of service for repair to prepare for winter. This will exacerbate the power shortage, which will increase even more with the onset of cold weather.

The frontline areas are at risk, where Russians are trying to destroy everything they can get their hands on. Take, for example, the shelling of the Sumy region on the night of 6 May, which simultaneously cut off power to more than 400,000 customers in Sumy and the region. Power engineers managed to quickly restore power supply to most local consumers thanks to backup schemes, but the overall situation remains tense.

At present, no massive scheduled outages are expected, but Ukrenergo urges to use electricity sparingly, especially during peak hours - from 07:00 to 10:00 a.m. and from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m.

Will electricity tariffs increase?

Money remains one of the most acute problems in the domestic energy sector, which could also affect power outages. Due to the non-payment crisis, companies are suffering from a lack of liquidity. Total debts in the gas and electricity markets amount to almost UAH 300 billion. The lack of funds for energy companies is expected to cause problems during summer repairs and preparations for the next heating season. An increase in electricity tariffs could be a way out of the situation.

Since 2022, Ukraine has had a moratorium on raising tariffs for gas, hot water and heating. At the same time, on 1 June 2023, the cost of electricity for households increased from UAH 1.44 to UAH 2.64 per kWh.

In its updated Inflation Report, the NBU forecasts a gradual increase in utility tariffs to economically justified levels over several years, but electricity tariffs for households will grow faster due to the difficult situation in the energy sector.

Delaying decisions on raising utility tariffs will lead to lower inflation, but will accumulate quasi-fiscal imbalances and worsen the financial condition of state-owned energy companies.

""This will increase the risks of instability in the domestic energy market, worsen the investment potential of the industry, while price pressure will only be postponed to the future,"" the NBU said.

Leaders of the Ukrainian energy sector increased their revenues by 8%. Who earned the most

In 2023, the leaders of Ukraine's energy sector earned UAH 745.87 billion, which is 8% more than the total revenue of these companies a year earlier (UAH 688.45 billion).

It is noted that the rating includes five state-owned companies, four companies from Rinat Akhmetov's SCM group, and Kyiv Regional Energy Company LLC owned by Nelia Kostenko (nominee of the Russian VS Energy Vojvodina group).

Eight companies are engaged in electricity generation and trading, and two more in gas trading.

According to Ruslan Slobodian, head of the State Energy Supervision Service, an increase in electricity tariffs may take place this year, as there is an urgent need for large financial resources to restore the power facilities damaged by Russian shelling.

""We will probably have to consider raising internal reserves and revise the electricity tariff. The NBU has predicted a gradual increase in the tariff over the next few years. Since a really large financial resource is needed to restore electricity facilities, the first stage of such an increase may be advisable to make this year,"" he explains.

According to preliminary estimates, it is impossible to cover $1 billion in losses with the current electricity tariff and available international assistance.

Back in March, the head of the Union of Consumers of Public Utilities, Oleh Popenko, spoke about raising electricity tariffs. According to him, a tariff of UAH 3.5-4 per kWh was being considered. However, the Ministry of Energy denied the information, calling it a fake.

Serhii Nahorniak, a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Energy, Housing and Utilities, also said earlier that the cost of electricity for household consumers could be doubled. In this case, the tariff would be just under UAH 6.

In general, according to the calculations of the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC), the market price for electricity for households is UAH 5.5-5.8 per kWh.

""I don't think energy tariffs will be raised to market levels, even if they do increase. Because the market level is a high enough level, the one that industrial consumers are currently paying,"" says Andrii Herus, chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Energy, Housing and Utilities.

He emphasises that there is no decision to revise the electricity tariff for households, but all possible sources of funding for the restoration of the power system are being discussed.

At the same time, Volodymyr Omelchenko, Director of Energy Programmes at the Razumkov Centre, points out that the energy dimension of the war is no less important than the front line. After all, if the enemy destroys the entire energy sector of Ukraine, the rear will not be able to support the front. Therefore, the issue of raising tariffs is relevant.

Decentralisation of generation and partners' money

Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi says that the only way to protect the energy system from the consequences of Russian attacks is to disperse electricity production across the country.

""The concentration of generation at a few sites is what leads to serious problems in the event of massive enemy attacks. We understand that the only sustainable way to protect the power system from such massive terror is to decentralise the capacities,"" he explains.

Kudrytskyi says that we need to build hundreds of small power plants that will be more resistant to massive attacks due to their dispersion. Accordingly, attacks will not lead to such severe consequences for the power grid as they do now.

Private companies are already considering investing in new distributed generation. For its part, Ukrenergo, as the power system operator, is doing everything possible to make these projects profitable for investors in the future.

According to Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the Ukrainian energy system currently needs new thermal generation, not coal-fired, but one that will run on waste from the woodworking industry, agricultural sector, etc.

In addition, the power system needs gas pickers - small, highly manoeuvrable power plants that run on gas - and energy storage systems.

The government is already considering the integration of gas turbine power plants into Ukraine's Integrated Power System. Such turbines serve many purposes, including facilitating the start-up of existing power plants after accidents, covering peak loads and providing backup power for critical infrastructure.

The Energy Community of Europe is helping us with this. At the end of April, the Energy Support Fund of Ukraine started collecting tender bids for the purchase of gas turbines for Ukraine. The procurement procedure is being conducted by the Energy Security Project, funded by USAID and implemented by Tetra Tech.

Volodymyr Kudrytskyi emphasises that the transformation of the energy system should be funded by private investors and with the help of partners, and not be passed on to the population by raising tariffs.",censor.net,news,Цензор.НЕТ,,-0.1372549019607843,452988950,100,https://images.cnscdn.com/2/d/0/d/2d0dcfe1f64baeb5f7fb795b3863567a/995x522.jpg,

Instead, I was arrested. | Opinion","When it came time to mark Passover this year, I knew I had to address the utilization of starvation as a weapon of war.

As a rabbi in Philadelphia whose family moved to Palestine from Lithuania in 1809 before immigrating to the U.S., I was horrified when, in the days following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant announced an order for Gaza's ""complete siege.""

He declared that ""no electricity, food, fuel or water will be delivered. We are fighting barbarians and will respond accordingly."" Reading these words, my heart sank, and I instantly felt nauseous.

I knew he meant it, I knew Israel had every intention to starve Palestinians, and I knew this was a complete abdication of Jewish values.

When my family came to Palestine from Lithuania, they first settled in the Old City of Jerusalem, and later became one of the seven families to settle outside of the Old City's walls in the Nahalat Shiva neighborhood of Jerusalem.

I am part of the Rivlin family, whose descendants have gone on to serve as president of Israel, outspoken anti-occupation activists, and everything in between. Growing up, on family trips to Israel, we would take pictures under the Rivlin Street sign in the Jerusalem neighborhood my ancestors settled.

It was meant to be a source of pride in our family that we were Jewish settlers. And it was for me until I went to study abroad at Hebrew University in Jerusalem during my junior year of college and learned about the Nakba, the catastrophic mass displacement of Palestinians in 1948 when Israel was founded, the ongoing military occupation of Palestinian lands, and the gruesome reality for Palestinians living under the Israeli state.

My pride transformed into commitment as I turned to dedicate my life to standing in solidarity with Palestinians and building a Jewish future worthy of the coming generations.

My family left Palestine during the First World War because my great-grandfather was seeking to avoid being drafted into the Ottoman army. A wealthy American Jew, Hershel Manischewitz, who was studying in his yeshiva in Jerusalem, helped him immigrate to the U.S. and set him up with work distributing his family's kosher food products in Cincinnati.

My great-grandfather's business continued for decades, with my father and uncles taking the helm. I grew up surrounded by food, taking joy rides on the pallet movers in the warehouse, bartering with local Jews for goods and services, and, of course, ritualized meals at my Bubbe's table for Shabbat and holidays. There was always a random guest at the table, someone my grandparents met in the community. There was always an open seat at the table.

At Passover, when we read from the Passover Haggadah -- ""Let all who are hungry come and eat"" -- we would take comfort in knowing we were doing our part as a family.

My family's history shaped my reaction, and ultimately how I moved out of despair. Fast-forward to October. In the days after Hamas attacked Israel and Israel invaded Gaza, I called together a group of rabbis to speak out for a cease-fire to save lives. That holy circle of faith leaders, Rabbis for Ceasefire, is now over 325 strong.

When it came time to mark Passover this year, we knew we had to address the Israeli government's utilization of starvation as a weapon of war against 2.3 million Palestinian people in the occupied Gaza Strip. This manufactured famine follows decades of forced displacement, military occupation, and communal subjugation by the Israeli government. So we planned to travel to the Gaza border to bring food into Gaza, arm-in-arm with Jewish Israeli comrades.

We have been watching for months as right-wing Jewish settlers have been given free rein at the southern border between Israel and Gaza, successfully blocking the entry of hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza.

We wanted to do the opposite -- to bring food in, to shepherd in aid, to demand a cease-fire, to show the people of Gaza they are not alone. As human rights experts warn that Gaza is now at catastrophic levels of famine, the urgency of our action was clear.

On Friday, April 26, a delegation from Rabbis for Ceasefire from the U.S. joined Israeli rabbis and Jews in a public attempt to deliver food aid to the people of Gaza through the Erez border crossing. As we marched toward the crossing with bags of rice and flour, we chanted the words of the Passover Haggadah: Kol dichfin yeitei v'yeichol -- let all who are hungry come and eat.

While food aid is essential, it is not sufficient. To save the lives of Palestinians on the verge of death by Israel's policy of forced starvation and siege, there must be significant infrastructure in place to supply and distribute food, with medical advice and supervision. This is not possible without a cease-fire and lifting the siege.

I was held for nearly 10 hours at the Ashkelon police station.

Unlike the right-wing settlers blocking aid from entering, we were immediately stopped, and myself and six others were arrested. The rest of the group retreated and brought the aid we had sought to bring to the starving people of Gaza to the West Bank, where Palestinians are the targets of vigilante settler violence, land theft, and military intimidation.

I was held for nearly 10 hours at the Ashkelon police station. The Israeli police officer who interrogated me after my arrest said, ""You are being detained because you tried to bring bags of rice and flour into Gaza."" Ultimately, we were released after agreeing to stay away from the Gaza border for 15 days.

Our success was not, of course, from bringing food into Gaza. The Israeli police prevented that. Rather, our nonviolent action succeeded in shining a light on Palestinians on the verge of death by starvation, offering them our solidarity, and reminding Jews of our responsibility to live our lives in accordance with the most sacred value of our beautiful tradition: We are each made in the image of the divine.",inquirer.com,news,The Philadelphia Inquirer,,-0.1450980392156863,452945318,5,https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/YMXONG-H7bw_9WO9ZqfNlP9oGUc=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/OSM336EINBFUPBV7QWEQ6XS2JY.jpg,

Speaking to the Guardian after meeting his British counterpart, David Cameron, in London, Gabrielius Landsbergis also backed the British foreign secretary for saying that Ukraine could use British-made weapons against Russia; remarks that alongside Emmanuel Macron refusing to rule out western troops in Ukraine prompted the Kremlin to threaten UK assets and order a tactical nuclear training exercise.

Foreign secretary in Lithuania for four years, Landsbergis has long called for tougher action against Russia, but his latest remarks have shown that there is support in parts of Europe for the muscular line recently adopted by the French president.

Macron has shocked some European colleagues and infuriated Russia by saying the west should not rule out sending troops to Ukraine.

""Our troops have been training Ukrainians in Ukraine before the war, and we've been doing that for many years. So returning to this tradition might be quite doable,"" Landsbergis said. ""This could be a first step in president Macron's initiative"".

He said a proposal to train Ukrainians inside their own country was ""more practical"" than the training taking place on the territory of Nato members.

""You don't need to transport them all the way. You have everything that they need right there,"" he said. ""It could be that the trainers stationed as part of the coalition to train the Ukrainians in Ukraine could be defended with air defence, and that in turn implies that part of Ukrainian sky could be defended with air defence.""

He said the move would ""tell Putin that it's not up to him to decide the way that we're helping Ukraine. Instead, we'll see what is needed, and we adapt to the situation because the situation is not getting better.""

He said the Lithuanian parliament had already given the government a mandate to train inside Ukraine but that this would be best done as part of a bigger coalition.

Macron, facing widespread criticism, has stood his ground on the idea of sending troops to Ukraine, arguing that it is legitimate to keep Russia guessing about what the west is prepared to do to defend Ukrainian sovereignty. Strategic ambiguity unsettles Vladimir Putin, he has said.

Landsbergis said Macron's remarks had already worked since the Kremlin had changed calculations.

He said nevertheless ""there's a lot of frustration"" within Ukraine. ""The Ukrainians are making it painfully clear, especially Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, as to what Patriot batteries are needed and how they would be used. It's impossible to make it any more clearer,"" he said.

""The damage that we're seeing - it's on us, it's our failure. It sounds like Russian success, but they can do this blindfolded if we're unable to defend Ukrainian cities. They're just bombarding the brain centres of the electricity grid which is way more difficult to fix.

""Looking into the next winter I honestly have a very difficult time to imagine how the country is going to fare.""

He said Europe's recent leadership on Ukraine had been ""a bit random"", adding that it took the Czech Republic, a relatively small country, to come up with an initiative to purchase ammunition en masse for Ukraine. ""I would love to see some of the bigger countries taking the lead in questions like air defence, tank coalition, or whatever,"" he said.

Landsbergis urged Britain to take a bigger role in Ukraine and denied that the country had taken too many steps away from Europe to make this possible. ""There is room. There is a need. There is potential and there are things that we can do together.""

He highlighted a potential role for the UK in addressing the hybrid threat posed by Russia, something he described as a new reality but not part of conventional military warfare.

""There is the possibility of kinetic hybrid activity, meaning physical attacks, arson, violence against individuals,"" he said, adding these assaults did not fall within the traditional definition of an attack to be addressed through Nato's Article 5.

The solar farm located in Lithuania started its full-scale electricity production at the end of April and is the largest in the Baltics.

Armen Kasparov, Director of Energy Trading and Portfolio Management at Eesti Energia, said that Enefit is the gateway to the energy market for renewable energy producers. Today, the company's customers include several solar and wind power producers across the Baltics who sell their production to the market.

""In order to be able to sell the electricity they produce on the market, producers must sign a contract that guarantees the sale of the electricity they do not have and the purchase of the surplus, the so-called open supply. Enefit combines the open supply and power sales contract into one, thus offering larger producers the possibility to sell electricity on the market through Enefit,"" he explained.

In addition to market access, the agreement includes several other benefits for producers, including a solar farm production forecasting service, balance responsibility and the possibility to limit production during low or negative price hours through a virtual power plant (VPP).

""As larger solar farms have production volumes in the tens of gigawatt-hours (GWh) per month and high turnover rates, an open supplier can create significant credit risk for the asset owner under normal payment conditions. By contrast, Eesti Energia's credit rating allows us to offer secure balance sheet management regardless of the company's production volumes,"" said Mr Kasparov.

Euractiv's Green Brief brings you a roundup of energy and environment news from across Europe. You can subscribe here.

Coal is the worst polluter. It accounts for a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Every year, anthracite, bituminous coal, and lignite do significant damage to the climate.

It was with some fanfare that the UK pushed for an end to coal at COP26 back in 2021 - with limited success. And it was celebrated that heavyweights like the US joined the ""Powering Past Coal Alliance"" at COP28 in December 2023.

So when G7 ministers signed up to kick coal to the curb in ""the first half of the 2030s"" in Italy last week, environmentalists' expectations were piqued.

Are rich countries - the club accounts for 30% of global GDP but only 21% of CO2 emissions - showing that the writing is really now on the wall for coal?

As always with coal, there are two sides to the story: one is the black rock's dropping share of power generation.

The other is continued high levels of consumption, underpinned by the temptation of cheap and easy power.

The bullish case for the climate is that renewables are well on track to take the 'power crown' from coal.

With the G7 agreement, the third and fourth-biggest coal power countries - the US and Japan respectively - are very much on their way out. Even if the G7 clause is not as baked in as climate activists may have hoped for.

Japan's commitment to ditching coal is particularly exciting for wider Asia - where Indonesia and South Korea take the fifth and sixth spots respectively.

Both in some ways are taking the development path chosen by the Japanese: manufacturing combined with coal power.

Once the government lets go of its ill-advised plans to co-fire coal with ammonia, clean power will win in Japan - making space for Seoul and Jakarta to follow suit.

This mirrors the global trend. Clean-energy think-tank Ember found that while coal produced 35% of the world's power in 2023, renewables breached 30%, for the first time that year.

Given above-average hydro yields, renewables could surpass coal before 2025.

""2023 was likely the pivot point - peak (carbon) emissions in the power sector - a major turning point in the history of energy,"" says Dave Jones Global Insights Programme Director at Ember.

Nowhere is this as well illustrated as in the EU, where coal dropped to its lowest-ever share of the electricity mix at 12% in 2023 - compared to 2022 coal usage plunged by a quarter.

This bears repeating; despite Poland's continued stubborn support of its coal industry and Germany's laborious nuclear exit, the black stuff is dying in Europe.

In the world's eighth-largest coal burner, South Africa, solar has helped utility Eskom avoid the daily multi-hour blackouts the country has become infamous for. However, opposition politicians stress that unconstrained diesel burning is the real cause, boosting the government ahead of upcoming elections.

This leaves China with 55% of global coal power production last year, an absolutely stunning amount.

And thus the more bearish case for the climate, holds that the transition from coal may be far slower. Political commitments to exit fossil fuels may be trumped by hard economics - specifically, the large investment required to switch from cheap and readily available coal rapidly.

Look at the major coal producer Glencore, which may keep its coal business instead of spinning it off, and whose stock is comfortably trading significantly above pre-COVID levels.

Or as Bloomberg's commodity wizard Javier Blas wrote, echoing the words of former Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg: ""We're too polite to admit the global economy remains, even in the age of the climate crisis, as 'horny as hell' for coal ... But, painfully, it is.""

Germany to invest in energy and transport sectors in the Baltic States. On Monday 6 May, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SDP) made an official visit to Rīga, where he met the prime ministers of the three Baltic states: Evika Siliņa for Latvia, Kaja Kallas for Estonia and Ingrida Šimonyte for Lithuania.

In addition to discussions on support for Ukraine and strengthening the defence of the three Baltic States against the Russian threat, the German leader discussed the development and implementation of joint energy and transport projects.

""Germany is our strategic partner in security and the economy, and today's talks have confirmed this"" declared Evika Siliņa, after referring to the opening of these discussions during her visit to Berlin on 27 March.

Scholz pointed out that Germany is working closely with the Baltic countries in the fields of digital technology, energy and transport, such as the Rail Baltica high-speed train project, which will connect the region's 3 capitals with the rest of the European Union.

""When it comes to renewable energies, there is great potential in offshore wind and green hydrogen, which we want to exploit together"" added the German Socialist leader.

""The Baltic states are first-class partners for us with their experience, but also with their geographical conditions, which we can all utilise together"" concluded Olaf Scholz, presaging increased German energy investment in the region. [Nathan Canas]

Hydrogen in ... bags? On a visit to Namibia on Thursday (2 May), King Philipp of Belgium was treated to a curious sight: hydrogen filled into 100-litre plastic bags and strapped onto backs - evocative of the highly dangerous gas containers impoverished Pakistanis rely on for cooking - as the flagship result of a hydrogen deal signed in 2021. The plan of the project is to allow for Namibians to use the gas for cooking or to remotely produce power.

When it came to the attention of energy experts, the scheme was quickly eviscerated. Philippe Smet, a researcher at the University of Gent, stressed that the bag contained around 9 grams of hydrogen, at best, containing enough power to bring a whopping 4 litres of water to boil. Instead, giving out batteries - or directly installing solar panels on location - would be the better solution.

""Let's hope that this project ... does not take away subsidies from projects that do make a difference,"" he added. [Nikolaus J.

In Lithuania, the electricity price level was identical to in Latvia, while in Estonia the average monthly price was slightly higher - EUR 60.39 per MWh.

The drop in electricity prices was driven by the high performance of solar, wind and hydropower plants, as well as warmer weather, which contributed to the decrease in electricity consumption.

The European Commission is offering up to EUR 850 million ($914.8 million) in funding for cross-border energy infrastructure projects such as carbon capture facilities, energy storage facilities, gas pipelines, hydrogen market hubs and power grid interconnections.

This is the first grant offer under the revised Trans-European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) Regulation, which took effect June 2022 aligning with the European Union's goal of turning into a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, the Commission said in a press release.

Projects eligible for the inaugural rollout must be among the preapproved list of so-called projects of common interest (PCIs) and projects of mutual interest (PMIs), formulated under the TEN-E Regulation and published November 28, 2023, as Regulation 2022/869. For the first time, offshore electricity grids and hydrogen projects can qualify for TEN-E support.

TEN-E projects receive EU assistance through the 2021-27 Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Energy, which has a budget of nearly EUR 6 billion ($64.6 billion).

""While fossil fuel projects have been excluded in principle from eligibility to PCI/PMI status and CEF Energy, new types of projects such as offshore electricity grids and hydrogen projects have become eligible"", the Commission noted.

Accepted proposals for CEF Energy funding under the revised TEN-E Regulation are for project studies and construction works. In the inaugural offer, developers have until October 22, 2024, to make submissions. Results are planned to be made known next year, the Commission said.

The pre-approved list aims to scale up cleaner energy in the 27-member region, as well as help member states whose grid is still linked to Russia to migrate their power distribution system to continental Europe.

The pre-approved projects include north-south power interconnections in the Baltics, Central Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe and Western Europe; offshore grids in the Atlantic, North Sea, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and Western Europe; hydrogen production-distribution networks in the Baltics, Central Eastern, Southeastern and Western Europe; and carbon capture and storage networks in the Baltics, the Mediterranean, the North Sea and between Croatia and Hungary.

As a PCI, the migration of the grids of the three remaining EU countries connected to the Russian grid is targeted to be completed by February 2025. Last year the Commission and the three nations -- the Baltic Sea neighborhood of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- signed a declaration to fast-track the integration by nearly a year compared to what was agreed under a political declaration in 2018.

The new declaration also involves Poland. The grid migration plan for the Baltic states will use a new project linking the power supply systems of Lithuania and Poland, called the Harmony Link Interconnector.

""The three Baltic States are the last remaining EU Member States with electricity networks that are still synchronized with Russia and Belarus"", the Commission said in a statement December 24, 2023, announcing the signing of the new declaration. ""Their synchronization is a strategic project of common interest.

""Over the past 12 years, it has received significant political, technical, and financial EU support exceeding EUR 1.2 bn [$1.3 billion] worth of grants"".

The statement added, ""Under the political declaration, the Member States concerned also committed to speeding up the development of the 'Harmony Link Interconnector', one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects between Lithuania and Poland"".

Harmony Link is a submarine line about 330 kilometers long (205.1 miles) using a high-voltage direct current cable that would connect Poland's Zarnoviec substation and Ltihuania's Darbėnai substation. The second power interconnection between Lithuania and Poland after the LitPol project (operational since 2016), Harmony Link is expected to be completed 2028.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.388235294117647,452673176,22,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/EU-Offers-915MM-Grants-for-CrossBorder-Energy-Infra-Projects-176634-582x327.webp,
