The final pits two high-profile English players against each other. Jude Bellingham has been outstanding for Real Madrid this season and in the build-up to the final his team-mate Luka Modric explained the precise moment he realised that Bellingham was the club's future.

Meanwhile for Dortmund, Jadon Sancho will be a goal threat. He too has enjoyed a productive season since being sent on loan by Manchester United, where he fell out badly with Erik ten Hag. A Champions League trophy lift for Sancho, at Wembley stadium, would be an extraordinary sight.

Should Madrid win, they will secure a double, having won La Liga for a 36th time. By contrast Borussia Dortmund finished fifth in the Bundesliga. The German side were also beaten in the round of 16 in the German Cup.

There was a late hiccup for Real as first-choice goalkeeper Andriy Lunin was ruled out with the flu, he'll be replaced by Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian has just returned to action following a a knee injury.

For the underdogs the fear is that their old player Bellingham could deal a hammer blow to their chances of victory, Dortmund, however, say they have a plan to cope with the England international.

New security arrangements at Wembley will be put to the test, with millions of pounds spent to avoid a repeat of the mayhem that surrounded the Euro 2020 final.

In the build-up to the game, our football experts have made their predictions for the Champions League final.

This year's Champions League final is tomorrow: Saturday, June 1. Kick-off is 8pm UK time.

TNT Sports have the UK rights to the Champions League and will be showing the final.

Viewers in the UK will be able to watch for free on discovery+, which is available via an app or on a smart TV. You will, however, have to register for an account. EE customers and Sky customers can also get discovery+ as part of their package.

The 2024 Champions League final is being held at Wembley Stadium in London.

The European Cup final returns to the famous venue for a record eighth time, and the third in the Champions League era following the 2011 and 2013 finals.

Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in an all-German affair in 2013, while in 2011 Manchester United lost 3-1 to a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona.

A young Pep Guardiola helped Barcelona win the 1992 European Cup final at the old Wembley in a 1-0 victory over Sampdoria.

Hosting the showpiece match at Wembley will also be an opportunity for English football to put the disgrace of the Euro 2020 final at the same venue behind it.

In the United States, the Champions League is shown on CBS and CBS Sports Network.

In the semi-final between Madrid and Bayern Munich, Joselu came off the substitute's bench to score twice to end Bayern's hopes of winning a seventh European Cup.

Good luck. But theoretically you can still apply to buy hospitality tickets for the final on Uefa's official ticket website.

Manchester City won the Champions League last season, beating Inter Milan 1-0 in the final, to complete a Treble. City were knocked out by Real Madrid in the quarter-finals this year.

Real Madrid's preparations for the Champions League final have suffered a huge blow with Andriy Lunin missing the final through 'flu and Thibaut Courtois starting in goal after missing most of the season.

Lunin, 25, has been Carlo Ancelotti's first-choice this season and was Real's shootout hero against Manchester City - but he has been unable to train and will travel to Wembley on the day of the final to be on the bench.

""Lunin has had the flu and it did not allow him to train this week or travel. He will travel on the day of the game and will be on the bench, and Courtois will be in goal,"" confirmed Ancelotti ahead of facing Borussia Dortmund.

Despite being loaned to Leganes, Valladolid and Oviedo in recent seasons, Lunin has been a key performer for Real this season in their La Liga title triumph and attempt at winning a 15th European Cup.

He has seized his chance after Courtois' serious knee injury ruled him out for most of the campaign before he made his comeback a month ago, playing in matches against Cadiz, Granada, Alaves and Real Betis.

While Courtois' return has been welcomed, Lunin remained No.1 and was picked for the Bayern semi-final legs while his team-mate was on the bench. Courtois has since been left out of the Belgium squad for the Euros. Domenico Tedesco, the head coach, says he is focusing on fully-fit players but Courtois has insisted he was 100 per cent ready.

Meanwhile, Ancelotti insists Rodrygo's future is at the Bernabeu despite the Brazil forward being linked with Manchester City when he called them the best team in the world ahead of facing them in April.

""Rodrygo is going to give it all he is a very important piece for us. He has been important, he is and he will be in the future, we have no doubt about that,"" said Ancelotti.

Borussia Dortmund fear Jude Bellingham returning to haunt them in the Champions League final - and will target the England international in their bid for glory at Wembley.

Bellingham spent three years at Dortmund before leaving for Real Madrid last summer in an £88.5 million deal and will now face his old club in the biggest match in European football.

His old team-mate Nico Schlotterbeck says he can ""do everything"" and says the key to upsetting the odds will be controlling the Real frontline of Bellingham, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo.

""I know Jude well as we played together for a year. He can do everything - run with the ball, without the ball, dribble, head the ball and shoot and you have to be very careful with him,"" said Schlotterbeck.

""You can't defend individually against them, you have to do it as a team and if we can control the three offensive players we have a chance to win.""

Bellingham has not been in touch with his old team-mates as they are concentrating on the London showpiece, with 30,000 Dortmund fans buying tickets and several thousand more travelling to England to be part of the atmosphere.

Dortmund have their own English connections with Jadon Sancho set to start from them in the final match of his loan back at Dortmund from Manchester United. Ian Maatsen has also been loaned from Chelsea and despite his excellent form has been surprisingly omitted from Holland's squad for the Euros.

Multi-million pound security improvements at Wembley since mayhem at Euro 2020 will be put to the test at Saturday's Champions League final.

The Football Association has invested £5 million on measures including extra closed-circuit TV, reinforced doors, more fencing and a new ""Zone X"" control room.

Chris Bryant, the FA's director of tournaments and events, recognised ""a lot of people"" will be thinking of 2021 as he promised such scenes will be avoided this time. ""We are doing all we can to ensure fans have a smooth arrival process and nice experience as they come to the stadium,"" he said of a co-ordinated plan, which includes the now regular drinking ban on Wembley Way.

An independent review by Baroness Casey identified more than 20 ""near-misses"" that could have resulted in serious injury or death as a result of ticketless individuals trying to gain entry, and in some cases succeeding, for the England v Italy match in July 2021.

Entrance to the stadium will be allowed four hours before kick-off instead of two, and Transport for London will run extra services to aid the flow of supporters to and from the ground.

Bryant acknowledged the steward supply at the Euro 2020 final was at a low point off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, and said Saturday's match would see ""the highest ever stewarding deployment in Wembley Stadium history"".

""One thing in the Euros final was very much the supply of stewarding, which I can say was at a low point off the back of Covid,"" he said. ""We're very confident the supply of stewarding which you've seen in the industry has bounced back.""

The winner of the final will receive €20 million (£17.1 million) from Uefa. However, with the accumulative prize money on offer as a team progresses through the tournament, the winner could net up to €85.14 million (£72.69 million), depending on their results. Last year Man City earned around £85 million for winning the trophy for the first time.

Real Madrid have won the European Cup 14 times, more than any other club.

AC Milan (7) are second on the all-time winners' list, with Liverpool and Bayern Munich tied for third with six wins. Barcelona have five wins, Ajax have four, Manchester United and Inter Milan have three apiece, while five teams have won it twice: Chelsea, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Benfica and Porto. Ten teams have won the title once: Man City, Aston Villa, Celtic, Borussia Dortmund (in 1997 when Lars Ricken's famous chip from distance helped them beat Juventus), Hamburg, Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven, Marseille, Red Star Belgrade and Steaua Bucharest.",sports.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Sports,,0.1686274509803922,454879649,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xeMqvyrdbLokJpyddeSbDA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/f8dbd9db0e4a937f4b54e5c586bf1664,eng-9613014

Catch the action live on SuperSport and live streaming available on DStv.

While Dortmund are in the final for only the third time - and the first since 2013, also at Wembley, when they lost an all-Bundesliga decider against Bayern München - and are looking to win the European Cup for the second time - the most recent of Madrid's record 14 titles came only two years ago.

Dortmund have won one and lost one of their two previous European Cup finals; in contrast, Madrid have featured in this contest 17 times and have lost only three, the last in 1981. They have been victorious in each of their last eight finals - all in the Champions League era.

Both sides came through epic semifinals to reach Wembley. Two sterling defensive displays took Dortmund past Paris Saint-Germain, while Madrid engineered another remarkable late revival, two late Joselu goals turning round their tie against Bayern.

FINAL FOCUS

This is the fifth European Cup final between teams from Germany and Spain. Each country has two wins apiece, Bayern beating Atlético de Madrid in 1974 and Valencia in 2000 while Madrid overcame Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960 and Bayer Leverkusen in 2002.

This is the eighth European Cup final to be played at Wembley:

Dortmund are featuring in their third European Cup final, all in the Champions League era. Their record is W1 L1:

The defeat by Bayern 11 years ago is the only all-German final - and the last time the match was played at Wembley.

Dortmund are the 13th club to appear in three or more European Cup finals.

Should BVB triumph at Wembley, the 27-year gap between their triumphs would be the fourth longest in European Cup history, with Inter Milan having endured the longest wait of 45 years between their triumphs in 1965 and 2010.

This is Dortmund's eighth final in Uefa competition. In addition to their two previous Champions League appearances, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965/66 - beating Liverpool 2-1 after extra time at Hampden Park in Glasgow - but lost in the Uefa Cup final in both 1992/93, to Juventus (1-3 h, 0-3 a) and 2001/02, to Feyenoord in Rotterdam (2-3). They also went down 3-1 on aggregate to Barcelona in the two-legged Uefa Super Cup in 1997 (0-2 a, 1-1 h) but beat Cruzeiro 2-0 in that year's European/South American Cup.

Mats Hummels and Marco Reus both played 90 minutes in that 2013 final.

Emre Can was a late substitute in Liverpool's 3-1 loss to Real Madrid in Kyiv in the 2018 Champions League final.

Niklas Süle was a first-half substitute as Bayern beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in Lisbon in the 2020 final.

REAL MADRID

Madrid have won a record 14 European Cups, and have triumphed in their last eight finals, all in the Uefa Champions League. Overall their final record is W14 L3:

In 2017 Madrid became the first side to make a successful Champions League title defence. They were the first team to retain the European Cup since Milan (1989, 1990). Their 2018 victory made them the first team to win the trophy three years in a row twice.

Luka Modrić and Dani Carvajal could appear in their sixth Champions League final victory for Madrid - matching Paco Gento's European Cup record.

In addition, Toni Kroos featured in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022 while Lucas Vázquez came on as a substitute in 2016 and Nacho has been a member of five victorious squads but only featured in the 2018 final.

Thibaut Courtois, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Federico Valverde plus Vinícius Júnior and the injured David Alaba all started Madrid's 2022 final win, Dani Ceballos, Eduardo Camavinga and Rodrygo coming on as late substitutes and Andriy Lunin an unused replacement.

Having scored the only goal against Liverpool in 2022, Vinícius Júnior could become only the eighth player to find the net in more than one Champions League final.

Madrid's triumph in Saint-Denis two years ago was the 12th Champions League win for a Spanish side - five more than the next highest-ranked nation, England, and seven more than Italy. Germany (four) is the only other country to have recorded multiple victories.

This is Madrid's 34th Uefa final. In addition to their 17 European Cup appearances, they were Uefa Cup winners in 1985 and 1986 and European Cup Winners' Cup runners-up in 1971 and 1983. They lifted the Uefa Super Cup in 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2022 alongside defeats in 1998, 2000 and 2018, and won the European/South American Cup in 1960, 1998 and 2002, losing in 1966 and 2000.

All 14 of the teams' previous meetings have come in the Champions League.

The sides' last fixtures, in 2017/18, proved a chastening experience for Dortmund, who lost 1-3 at home and 2-3 away against their Spanish rivals on their way to picking up only two points in Group H. Gareth Bale scored once and Cristiano Ronaldo twice in Madrid's Matchday 2 victory in Germany before Lucas Vázquez's late winner in Spain after early strikes from Borja Mayoral and Ronaldo had been cancelled out by a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang double.

The teams had drawn 2-2 in both Germany and Spain in the 2016/17 group stage. Madrid twice led in Dortmund, through Ronaldo and Raphaël Varane; Aubameyang and, in the 87th minute, André Schürrle replied for Thomas Tuchel's BVB. Dortmund then secured first place in the section by coming from 2-0 down to snatch a point in Spain on Matchday 6, Karim Benzema's double (28, 53) putting Madrid in command, but goals from Aubameyang (60) and Marco Reus (88) giving the visitors the vital point.

In the 2013/14 quarterfinals, Madrid prevailed 3-2 on aggregate en route to lifting the trophy. Gareth Bale, Isco and Ronaldo earned Ancelotti's side a 3-0 first-leg lead before Dortmund, coached by Jürgen Klopp, narrowed the deficit with a 2-0 victory in Germany through two Reus strikes.

That offered a measure of revenge for Dortmund's victory in the previous season's semifinals. Robert Lewandowski was the star of the show as Dortmund reached their second Champions League final, the Poland international getting all four of the German side's goals in a 4-1 win in the home first leg, Ronaldo having made it 1-1. Dortmund progressed despite a 2-0 reverse in Madrid where Benzema and Sergio Ramos scored.

The teams had also faced off in that season's group stage, when Dortmund finished above Madrid with the help of a 2-1 home win - Lewandowski and Marcel Schmelzer scoring either side of Ronaldo - and a 2-2 draw in Madrid where Reus again featured on the scoresheet.

In the 2002/03 second group stage, Madrid came from behind to beat Dortmund on Matchday 3 in Group C thanks to goals from Raúl González and Brazilian striker Ronaldo, but needed a 92nd-minute Javier Portillo equaliser to rescue a 1-1 draw in Germany a week later. That proved crucial as the Spanish side edged out Dortmund by a single point to take second place in the section.

The sides had met for the first time in 1997/98, when Dortmund's defence of the Champions League they had won in Munich the previous year was ended by Madrid at the semifinal stage. A goal in each half from Fernando Morientes and Christian Karembeu in the Santiago Bernabéu first leg proved crucial, Jupp Heynckes' side holding on for a goalless draw in Dortmund en route to claiming Madrid's first European Cup in 32 years.

BVB have already faced Spanish opponents this season, beating Madrid's City rivals Atlético in the quarterfinals (1-2 a, 4-2 h).

That made Dortmund's record in knockout ties against Spanish clubs W7 L3.

The second-leg success against Atlético was only Dortmund's fourth victory in their last 14 matches against Liga clubs, home and away (D5 L5).

Dortmund were paired with Sevilla in last season's group stage, winning 4-1 in Spain before a 1-1 home draw. They had also beaten the Spanish side in the 2020/21 round of 16, winning 3-2 away before a 2-2 home draw with Erling Haaland scoring four of their five goals in the tie.

Last season's Bundesliga runners-up are in the Champions League for the 18th time overall and the eighth successive season. All but two of their last 11 campaigns have now extended into the knockout rounds.

In 2022/23, Edin Terzić's team were second in Group G behind eventual champions Manchester City before being knocked out by Chelsea in the round of 16 (1-0 h, 0-2 a).

This season Dortmund began with a 2-0 loss in Paris before being held 0-0 at home by Milan but breathed life into their Group F campaign by beating Newcastle away (1-0) and at home (2-0) and sealed progress with a 3-1 win at San Siro on Matchday 5, concluding the group stage with a 1-1 draw at home to Paris.

Dortmund drew 1-1 at PSV Eindhoven in the round of 16 first leg, progressing thanks to a 2-0 home win, and then overcame a 2-1 loss at Atlético de Madrid in the first leg of their quarterfinal to go through thanks to a 4-2 home success, that second-leg win ending a run of five successive defeats in quarterfinal matches.

They then defeated Paris 1-0 both home and away in the last four, the second-leg victory at the Parc des Princes only their second in their last 12 away Champions League knockout matches; they lost nine of those games.

Dortmund's record in Uefa penalty shoot-outs is W2 L2:

2-4 v Club Brugge, 2003/04 Uefa Champions League third qualifying round

Madrid have already faced three German clubs this season. They were paired with Union Berlin in Group C, Jude Bellingham scoring in the 94th-minute to secure a 1-0 home win on Matchday 1 before Dani Ceballos struck in the 89th minute of a 3-2 victory in Germany on Matchday 6.

They then overcame Leipzig in the last 16, a 1-0 first-leg victory in Germany preceding a 1-1 home draw, and Bayern in the semifinals (2-2 a, 2-1 h), Joselu scoring in the 88th and 91st minutes of the second leg to engineer a remarkable comeback.

A 3-2 loss at Leipzig on Matchday 5 last season is Madrid's only defeat in their last 20 matches against Bundesliga clubs, home and away (W13 D6).

Ancelotti's side also beat German opponents in the 2022 Uefa Super Cup, defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 in Helsinki. That was Madrid's fourth Uefa final against opposition from Germany and a fourth victory, and a third game on neutral territory against a Bundesliga club. Aside from their European Cup final wins against Frankfurt in 1960 and Leverkusen in 2002, they also defeated Köln on aggregate in the two-legged Uefa Cup final in 1986 (5-1 h, 0-2 a).

This season's round of 16 meeting with Leipzig was Madrid's first knockout tie against a Bundesliga club since beating Bayern 4-3 on aggregate in the 2017/18 semifinals.

Madrid's record in knockout ties with German clubs in Uefa competition is now W20 L8. They have won each of their last ten ties against German opposition, scoring 41 goals in the process; their last defeat came against Dortmund in the 2012/13 semifinals (1-4 a, 2-0 h).

This is Madrid's 28th Champions League campaign, a competition record they share with Barcelona. They last missed out in 1996/97.

Madrid have now qualified for the knockout rounds in all 28 campaigns and have won their section 20 times including each of the last four.

Having claimed the club's 14th European Cup - and eighth Champions League, also a competition record - in 2021/22, Ancelotti's side then finished first in their section last season, winning four of their six games (D1 L1) before beating Liverpool in the round of 16 (5-2 a, 1-0 h). That set up a second successive quarterfinal against Chelsea, Madrid winning 2-0 home and away, before going out against Manchester City (1-1 h, 0-4 a).

The 4-0 defeat at City last season equalled Madrid's biggest Champions League loss.

This season, after seeing off Union Berlin on Matchday 1, Ancelotti's side have beaten both Napoli (3-2 a, 4-2 h) and Braga (2-1 a, 3-0 h) twice. They made it six group wins from six - matching their feat in 2011/12 and 2014/15 - with a 3-2 victory at Union.

A 1-0 win at Leipzig in the round of 16 first leg put Madrid in control of that tie, although they failed to win for the first time in this season's competition in the return, which ended 1-1.

Ancelotti's side then came through an epic quarterfinal against City, the first leg finishing 3-3 in Madrid and the Manchester return 1-1 before the Spanish side prevailed 4-3 on penalties and saw off Bayern in the last four thanks to Joselu's late intervention (2-2 a, 2-1 h).

Madrid's record in five Uefa penalty shoot-outs is W3 L2:

5-6 v Crvena zvezda, 1974/75 European Cup Winners' Cup quarterfinal

England won that World Cup without Sancho but soon he was playing for the senior team and on way to becoming a star in Bundesliga.

There was talk of him being mentally strong - Sancho had trained and played in the week his grandmother died and was praised for it by then skipper Marco Reus.

By joining Dortmund instead of staying on at Manchester City, whose academy he had joined from Watford, like his England teammate Phil Foden, Sancho had even become a trendsetter of sorts. Mason Mount and Ademola Lookman were among those who had walked Sancho's path. In an interview to FourFourTwo in 2019, Sancho had explained why he joined Borussia Dortmund.

""Youngsters get opportunities. You have got to thank Borussia Dortmund because it is unheard for a team that gets 80,000 fans at every home game to put so much faith in youngsters,"" said Sancho, 24.

Sancho aggregated 50 goals and 64 assists in 137 games for Borussia Dortmund. He also won the German Cup. In short, life was good. So good that Manchester United came calling with an €85m offer, one that Dortmund could not refuse. Given that Erling Haaland, Ousmane Dembele, Robert Lewandowski and Jude Bellingham, among others, have used Dortmund as a finishing school, that sale was not unusual. In fact, it felt like a win-win for both.

And that's when things started to slip sliding away. Manchester United did not and do not have the attacking structure Sancho was used to at Dortmund. They also went through a churn of managers and Sancho had a fallout with the man still in charge of the team, Erik ten Hag. It led to him being frozen out till Dortmund, at the initiative of sporting director and former Germany player Sebastian Kehl, welcomed him back on loan.

""It was not an easy situation in January to bring Jadon to Dortmund,"" Kehl told reporters on Tuesday. ""But we knew Jadon had the skills to perform, to be decisive and to bring us to another level. Jadon is such a great person, a great player, and the experience he had in Manchester helped him to perform now.""

Sancho had an assist each in his first two games for Dortmund and scored thrice in 14 Bundesliga games. He also scored against PSV in the Champions League. Two goals and three assists in 14 games in the league and one goal in the Champions League do not great numbers make but considering he wasn't training with the first team at Manchester United for months, it is creditable.

It was against Paris St Germain in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final that Sancho was in his element. He finished 12 dribbles, the most in a Champions League semi-final since Lionel Messi in 2008. That alone tells a story but Sancho's defensive shift to help right back Julian Ryerson was just as commendable. It made for a full package.

One that has got him a chance to play the Champions League final, a possibility not worthy of considering even a few months ago. ""To be fair, it felt surreal. Again, it still hasn't hit me,"" Sancho told CNN on Thursday. ""It's kind of crazy, you know, I don't think anyone would have expected this - me being in the Champions League final, especially where I came from? I'm just happy.""

The focus on Saturday will be on the farewell of Real Madrid's Toni Kroos and Dortmund's Marco Reus. There will be the business of Dortmund seeking a better end than the 1-2 defeat to Bayern Munich they had in 2013, the only other time they played a Champions League final at Wembley. From that squad, only Reus and Mats Hummels remain.

It will also be a redemption opportunity for Sancho. It was at Wembley that he had missed a penalty in the tie-breaker as England failed to hold on to an early lead and lost to Italy in the final of the 2021 European championship. Gareth Southgate was not convinced by his form at Dortmund to include him in the long list for next month's Euros. A good performance on Saturday could show Manchester United and England that Sancho's best years are ahead of him.",hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,,0.2705882352941176,454866872,1,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/31/1600x900/FBL-GER-BUNDESLIGA-LEIPZIG-DORTMUND-12_1717169201495_1717169916342.jpg,eng-9610358

Despite finishing a lackluster fifth in the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund fans are ecstatic as their team prepares to face Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday.

The success of this season, coupled with the team's previous triumphs in 1997 and 2013, has translated into a 14% year-to-date surge for the club's shares (BVB) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

In May alone, the stock has gained 12% in anticipation of the final. A victory against the Spanish giants could further boost the stock's upward trajectory.

Overcoming Real Madrid will be no easy feat for the Dortmund team, as the Spanish club is the all-time leader in the competition with 14 trophies. Borussia has only won the Champions League once, in 1996/97, defeating Juventus of Italy 3-1 in the final.

They then went on to beat Dida and Bebeto's Cruzeiro 2-0 in the Intercontinental Cup final. In 2012/13, they faced fellow German side Bayern Munich in the final but lost 2-1 to finish as runners-up.

The team's impressive Champions League run, eliminating giants along the way, has raised expectations not only for a title but also for revenue and profit growth.

Dortmund has left behind established clubs in the competition, including Milan (Italy), Newcastle (England), PSV (Netherlands), Atlético de Madrid (Spain), and Paris Saint-Germain (France).

In the last balance sheet, released on May 10th, the club reported total revenue of €104 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 1.7% from the previous quarter, but a net loss of €21 million.

For the previous season, 2022/23, reported in the middle of last year, total revenue was €490 million (18% higher than 2021/22) and net profit was €9.6 million (after a loss of €32 million in 2021/22).

In the current season, the club has already achieved a net profit of €49 million on revenue of €443 million. For this Champions League, Borussia projects to earn over €100 million in total - if they win the title, the UEFA prize money is an additional €20 million.

Bullish sentiment surrounding Borussia Dortmund (BVB) stock extends beyond the possibility of winning the European title.

The club was profitable in the previous season and is expected to remain so in the near future, with projected earnings growth in 2024. Additionally, Dortmund maintains a moderate debt level (Net Debt/Total Capital of 10.9%).

On the other hand, current liquidity is low (0.6x), with short-term liabilities exceeding liquid assets. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates the stock is overbought (meaning there is a risk of a price decline).

BVB's overall financial health score is 2.69, close to the average (2.75), indicating no cause for concern. The most notable strengths lie in the Price Trend category (score of 3.35), with an excellent return over the past three months (23.3%), and Profitability (score of 2.94), characterized by a Gross Margin of 94.8% and an average ROE of 96.2% over the past two years.

Borussia Dortmund is not the only football club with publicly traded shares. Two other traditional European teams and former Champions League winners also have shares listed on stock exchanges: Manchester United (NYSE:MANU) on the NYSE and Juventus Football Club (BIT:JUVE) on the Borsa Italiana.

Manchester United won the FA Cup last Saturday against rivals Manchester City, but their underwhelming Premier League season resulted in an 18% drop in their stock price in 2024. Juventus also underperformed in Serie A, and their stock has declined by 27% this year.

Despite finishing a lackluster fifth in the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund fans are ecstatic as their team prepares to face Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday.

The success of this season, coupled with the team's previous triumphs in 1997 and 2013, has translated into a 14% year-to-date surge for the club's shares (BVB) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

In May alone, the stock has gained 12% in anticipation of the final. A victory against the Spanish giants could further boost the stock's upward trajectory.

Overcoming Real Madrid will be no easy feat for the Dortmund team, as the Spanish club is the all-time leader in the competition with 14 trophies. Borussia has only won the Champions League once, in 1996/97, defeating Juventus of Italy 3-1 in the final.

They then went on to beat Dida and Bebeto's Cruzeiro 2-0 in the Intercontinental Cup final. In 2012/13, they faced fellow German side Bayern Munich in the final but lost 2-1 to finish as runners-up.

The team's impressive Champions League run, eliminating giants along the way, has raised expectations not only for a title but also for revenue and profit growth.

Dortmund has left behind established clubs in the competition, including Milan (Italy), Newcastle (England), PSV (Netherlands), Atlético de Madrid (Spain), and Paris Saint-Germain (France).

Here's what you need to know before the European Cup final -including odds and prize money

Real Madrid will face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final tomorrow night.

The final pits two high-profile English players against each other. Jude Bellingham has been outstanding for Real Madrid this season and in the build-up to the final his team-mate Luka Modric explained the precise moment he realised that Bellingham was the club's future.

Meanwhile for Dortmund, Jadon Sancho will be a goal threat. He too has enjoyed a productive season since being sent on loan by Manchester United, where he fell out badly with Erik ten Hag.

Should Madrid win, they will secure a double, having won La Liga for a 36th time. By contrast Borussia Dortmund finished fifth in the Bundesliga. The German side were also beaten in the round of 16 in the German Cup.

Real Madrid have won the European Cup 14 times, more than any other club. Dortmund were winners in 1997 when Lars Ricken's famous chip from distance helped them beat Juventus.

New security arrangements at Wembley will be put to the test, with millions of pounds spent to avoid a repeat of the mayhem that surrounded the Euro 2020 final.

When is the Champions League final?

This year's Champions League final is tomorrow: Saturday, June 1. Kick-off is 8pm UK time.

What channel is it being shown on TV in the UK?

TNT Sports have the UK rights to the Champions League and will be showing the final.

Viewers in the UK will be able to watch for free on discovery+, which is available via an app or on a smart TV. You will, however, have to register for an account. EE customers and Sky customers can also get discovery+ as part of their package.

Where is it being held?

The 2024 Champions League final is being held at Wembley Stadium in London.

The European Cup final returns to the famous venue for a record eighth time, and the third in the Champions League era following the 2011 and 2013 finals.

Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in an all-German affair in 2013, while in 2011 Manchester United lost 3-1 to a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona.

A young Pep Guardiola helped Barcelona win the 1992 European Cup final at the old Wembley in a 1-0 victory over Sampdoria.

Hosting the showpiece match at Wembley will also be an opportunity for English football to put the disgrace of the Euro 2020 final at the same venue behind it.

How can I watch in the US?

In the United States, the Champions League is shown on CBS and CBS Sports Network.

What happened in the Champions League semi-finals?

In the semi-final between Madrid and Bayern Munich, Joselu came off the substitute's bench to score twice to end Bayern's hopes of winning a seventh European Cup.

Borussia Dortmund secured their place when Mats Hummels scored the only goal of their second leg, securing a 2-0 aggregate win over Paris St-Germain.

First leg: Bayern Munich 2 Real Madrid 2

First leg: Borussia Dortmund 1 PSG 0

Second leg: PSG 0 Borussia Dortmund 1; agg 0-2

Second leg: Real Madrid 2 Bayern Munich 1; agg 4-3

How to buy tickets for the final

Good luck. But theoretically you can still apply to buy hospitality tickets for the final on Uefa's official ticket website.

Who are the current champions?

Manchester City won the Champions League last season, beating Inter Milan 1-0 in the final, to complete a Treble. City were knocked out by Real Madrid in the quarter-finals this year.

Latest newsFA promises no repeat of 2021 mayhem as it beefs up Wembley security

Multi-million pound security improvements at Wembley since mayhem at Euro 2020 will be put to the test at Saturday's Champions League final.

The Football Association has invested £5 million on measures including extra closed-circuit TV, reinforced doors, more fencing and a new ""Zone X"" control room.

Chris Bryant, the FA's director of tournaments and events, recognised ""a lot of people"" will be thinking of 2021 as he promised such scenes will be avoided this time. ""We are doing all we can to ensure fans have a smooth arrival process and nice experience as they come to the stadium,"" he said of a co-ordinated plan, which includes the now regular drinking ban on Wembley Way.

An independent review by Baroness Casey identified more than 20 ""near-misses"" that could have resulted in serious injury or death as a result of ticketless individuals trying to gain entry, and in some cases succeeding, for the England v Italy match in July 2021.

Entrance to the stadium will be allowed four hours before kick-off instead of two, and Transport for London will run extra services to aid the flow of supporters to and from the ground.

Bryant acknowledged the steward supply at the Euro 2020 final was at a low point off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, and said Saturday's match would see ""the highest ever stewarding deployment in Wembley Stadium history"".

""One thing in the Euros final was very much the supply of stewarding, which I can say was at a low point off the back of Covid,"" he said. ""We're very confident the supply of stewarding which you've seen in the industry has bounced back.""

What is the prize money for the Champions League?

The winner of the final will receive €20 million (£17.1 million) from Uefa. However, with the accumulative prize money on offer as a team progresses through the tournament, the winner could net up to €85.14 million (£72.69 million), depending on their results. Last year Man City earned around £85 million for winning the trophy for the first time.

Who have won the most European Cups?

Real Madrid have won the European Cup the most times (14), AC Milan (7) are second, with Liverpool and Bayern Munich tied for third with six wins. Barcelona have five wins, Ajax have four, Manchester United and Inter Milan have three apiece, while five teams have won it twice: Chelsea, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Benfica and Porto. Ten teams have won the title once: Man City, Aston Villa, Celtic, Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg, Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven, Marseille, Red Star Belgrade and Steaua Bucharest.

· Acquisition of a 26.1% interest in LNEnergy Limited (""LNEnergy""), built in stages throughout 2023 for a total consideration of £4.3m (£1.9 million of which was in cash and the balance in 1,297,297,298 new Reabold shares). LNEnergy's primary asset is an exclusive option over a 90% interest in the Colle Santo gas field, a highly material gas resource with an estimated 65bcf of 2P reserves, with two production wells already drilled and a development-ready field, subject to approvals and permits. Financing and approvals are progressing well for the liquified natural gas (""LNG"") field development.

· Cash of £5.4 million as at 31 December 2023; net assets of £42.2 million

· Cash proceeds of £5.2 million received during the financial year for second tranche proceeds from the sale of Corallian

· £263,000 returned to shareholders through share buybacks as part of the distribution of Corallian sale proceeds, with a further £75,000 returned post period end.

· Final tranche cash proceeds of £4.4 million for the sale of Corallian, received from Shell in January 2024; Reabold net cash of £8.2 million as at 30 April 2024

· At West Newton, a Gas Export Feasibility study completed by independent energy consultants, CNG Services Limited, concluded that as a precursor to the intended West Newton full field development, an initial single well development and gas export plan can accelerate production and cash flow whilst requiring limited capital expenditure, giving the joint venture the ability to drill future wells out of cash flow. See Review of Operations section for further details.

· Execution of a non-binding Heads of Agreement between Gunvor International B.V. (""Gunvor"") and LNEnergy for the purchase of LNG by Gunvor from LNEnergy from the Colle Santo gas field.

Reabold Resources plc has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects. Reabold's strategy is to invest in low-risk, near-term projects which it considers to have significant valuation uplift potential, with a clear monetisation plan, where receipt of such proceeds will be returned to shareholders and re-invested into further growth projects. This strategy is illustrated by the recent sale of the undeveloped Victory gas field to Shell, the proceeds of which are being returned to shareholders and re-invested.

In the financial year ended 31 December 2023, Reabold continued with its strategy of identifying, investing in, maturing and monetising undeveloped gas discoveries with significant resources and near-term production potential. Our emphasis is on investing in UK and European gas assets to enhance domestic energy supply and security, which has been exposed in recent years by the Ukraine war. The sale of the Victory strategic gas project to Shell U.K. Limited (""Shell"") in late 2022 reaffirmed our view that there is further opportunity for value creation by applying our strategy to similar assets. Portfolio activity undertaken in 2023 reflects this approach; Reabold reinvested some of the proceeds from the Victory transaction into a significant new opportunity in Italy, the Colle Santo onshore gas field, and continued to commit resources to and develop the attractive prospects of the PEDL183 onshore licence at West Newton in the UK. Other investments in the Reabold portfolio, such as the Romanian licences, continue to hold attractive optional value in the long-term but were not a capital allocation priority in 2023.

At West Newton, we were pleased to receive approval permits from the Environment Agency, a key step forward in enabling further licence activity. We were however disappointed with the delay in drilling of the first development well, which had been targeted for the second half of 2023. Rathlin, the site operator, was unable to resolve funding for its own share in 2023, which we believe is a consequence of the fiscal and political instability in the UK. With a strong balance sheet throughout the year and £8.2 million of cash as at 30 April 2024, Reabold has more than sufficient funding for its direct share of the planned drilling on the licence. And having confirmed a materially lower phased capital expenditure plan for a single well development and early cash flow from production, ahead of the full field development longer-term, we now look forward to an enhanced level of interest and the resolution of Rathlin's funding situation in 2024 through a potential farm-out arrangement or other sources of capital. As a Board, we remain confident in the prospects for West Newton and are fully focused on realising the asset's significant value potential for shareholders.

Outside the UK, we took the decision to build a significant stake (26.1% by the end of 2023) in LNEnergy for a total cost of £4.3 million (£1.9 million in cash and £2.4 million via the issuance of 1,297,297,298 new ordinary shares). We were attracted to LNEnergy because of the exclusive option it has over a 90% interest in the Colle Santo gas field, a highly material onshore gas resource in central Italy, with two production wells already drilled and a field that is development ready, subject to the approvals process. The primary focus for this asset in 2023 was to progress the necessary regional and national approvals required to begin operations. We are encouraged by the favourable momentum in this approvals process throughout 2023 and into the current financial year, helped by the political desire to improve domestic energy security. LNEnergy is working towards securing all necessary permits in the near future. It is also pleasing to report that LNEnergy has secured a well-known, highly experienced technical partner, Italfluid, to act as contract operator and, since the period end, has signed a Heads of Agreement with Gunvor, a leading global LNG trader, for the purchase of LNG from the Colle Santo production facility. 2024 will be an important year in gaining all the formal approvals and operationalising the site to start producing first gas and generating early cash flow, currently targeted for 2025.

From a corporate and governance perspective, 2023 was a year of mixed fortunes and outcomes. The Board and management team had to deal once again with the unwelcome distraction of a second unsuccessful general meeting requisition, driven by Kamran Sattar of Portillion Capital. This consumed valuable time and resource from our efforts to progress our two key assets in the UK and Italy, as described above. With the cash proceeds from the Victory asset sale on our balance sheet, we initiated a share buyback programme - returning £263,000 to shareholders in 2023 and a further £75,000 post period end. Our net assets on the balance sheet were £42.2 million, well above the market capitalisation of the Company at the time of writing. It is now our duty to ensure the full potential and value of Reabold's portfolio is delivered to shareholders. As a Board, we remain confident that this can be achieved, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.

Reabold is an investing company focussed on developing strategic European gas assets to secure European gas supply and energy security. Reabold has a diversified portfolio of gas assets comprised of development, appraisal and exploration projects. Reabold aims to generate shareholder value by making disciplined and focused investments to grow our business. Reabold's strategy is to invest in existing undeveloped gas discoveries with significant resources and near-term production potential, which have considerable valuation uplift potential and a clear monetisation plan. Proceeds from monetisation events are balanced between shareholder returns and re-investment into new and existing projects.

We are preparing for the future and responding to the increased focus on energy security brought about by the rise in geopolitical conflict and instability in the region, and globally. Concern about energy shortages and vulnerability to geopolitical events has prompted many governments to prioritise access to more domestically produced energy and reduce their dependency on imported gas. Reabold aims to contribute to Europe's energy security by unlocking potential sources of near-term domestic gas supply, at a time when the continent is exposed to potentially significant gas supply disruptions. In this regard, the Company identified, matured and sold the strategic Victory gas project in the UK to Shell for £32.0m (£12.7m net to Reabold).

We are focused on the disciplined allocation of capital to deliver on our strategic objectives. Reabold's current focus is on its two key gas assets that have strong parallels with Victory: West Newton (UK onshore) & Colle Santo (Italy onshore). Similar to Victory, both assets are highly material, undeveloped gas discoveries in Europe. Full details of these operations are included in the Review of Operations.

The Group's main business is to invest in direct and indirect interests in exploration and development gas projects. Reabold's long-term strategy is to re-invest capital generated through monetisation of its investments into new projects in order to grow the Company and create value for its shareholders. The Company tracks its new business development objectives through the building of a risk-balanced portfolio of assets. The Company reviews its KPIs on an ongoing basis as it moves through the lifecycle of its strategy to ensure they continue to serve as a useful measure of our strategic performance.

The Board assesses the performance of the Group across measures and indicators that are consistent with Reabold's strategy and investor proposition.

Co-Chief Executive Officers' Review of Operations

In 2023, it became even clearer that Europe needs a secure, affordable and lower carbon energy system. The Russia-Ukraine war continued in 2023 and renewed conflict in the Middle East has raised political tensions. Reabold's strategy is to improve Europe's energy security by unlocking potential sources of near-term domestic gas supply, at a time when Europe is exposed to potentially significant gas supply disruptions. In this regard, the Company identified, matured and sold the strategic Victory gas project to Shell for £32.0m (£12.7m net to Reabold).

The last few years were about generating options. In 2024, and as we drive to 2025, we will focus on our two key gas assets that have strong parallels with Victory, namely West Newton in the UK and Colle Santo in Italy, where the Company plans to apply the same successful strategy demonstrated with Victory. We will discuss the details of each project below.

West Newton is an onshore hydrocarbon discovery located north of Hull, England. To date, three successful wells have been drilled at West Newton (A-1, A-2 and B-1z) confirming a major discovery - potentially one of the largest hydrocarbon fields discovered onshore UK. Rathlin Energy (UK) Limited (""Rathlin"") is the operator of the licence in which it holds a 66.67% interest. Reabold has a 59.5% shareholding in Rathlin and a direct 16.67% interest in the licence, giving the Company an aggregate c. 56% economic interest in West Newton. The other co-venturer on the licence is Union Jack Oil with a 16.67% direct interest.

A Gas Export Feasibility study completed by CNG Services Limited in the first half of 2024, concludes that, as a precursor to the intended West Newton full field development, an initial single well development and gas export plan can accelerate production and cash flow whilst requiring limited capital expenditure. With the industry currently suffering from a lack of available development capital, the ability to achieve early production with limited capex is strategically extremely valuable. Initial gas production will be from a single horizontal well, processed through a modular plant, tied in from the A site to the National Transmission System at an existing above ground installation via a pipeline. The single well development plan benefits from early cash generation with the ability to drill future wells out of cash flow. Drilling of the next well at West Newton is subject to Rathlin funding and regulatory approval. Following drilling and testing of this horizontal well, first gas is expected 18 months later with an associated development capex estimated to be c.£12 million. Although early production from the single well development demonstrates highly attractive standalone economics and would support future wells being drilled from cashflow, it is envisaged that it will be a precursor to the full field conceptual development plan which had an associated pre-tax NPV(10) of US$222 million, net to Reabold, based on the PEDL183 CPR effective 30 June 2022.

In May 2024, Reabold commissioned GaffneyCline to perform a carbon intensity study for the West Newton field. The GaffneyCline study highlighted the following:

· The West Newton project has an AA rating for Carbon Intensity for its potential upstream gas and condensate production, the lowest possible carbon intensity rating category on GaffneyCline's scale

· The West Newton field has a Carbon Intensity significantly lower than the UK average and onshore and offshore analogues. It is also significantly lower than the average imported LNG, based on the NSTA Natural Carbon Footprint Analysis published in July 2023

· Based on the study, GaffneyCline estimates that West Newton could produce the equivalent of just 2.87 grams of CO2 per megajoule of energy developed (gCO2eq./MJ)

· As the development proceeds and project knowledge increases, there is potential to improve the Carbon Intensity by further reducing fugitive, flaring and venting emissions and by gas-to-grid development, reducing on site gas and condensate processing, and using the shortest possible route to the National Grid

The AA rating demonstrates the low carbon credentials of the West Newton project and is an example of the opportunities available in the UK to power the country through lower carbon, home grown energy, rather than relying on expensive and more carbon intensive imports. For more information, please see the ESG section of this report on pages 15-17.

The joint venture has a commitment to the North Sea Transition Authority (""NSTA"") to drill and test a new Kirkham Abbey deviated or horizontal well by June 2024 and to recomplete or sidetrack and test one of the existing wells in that same timeframe. As mentioned above, drilling of the first development well is subject to Rathlin securing funding. There is an active process underway to assess options to source funding for Rathlin's share of the cost, including through a farmout, or through further investment from Reabold, which, following the receipt of the proceeds from Shell, the Company could potentially provide, in addition to funding its own share. As a result of Rathlin's funding shortfall, drilling of the first development well will not be completed prior to June 2024. Rathlin, as operator, has initiated discussions with the NSTA to defer the deadlines for these commitments.

In May 2023, Reabold acquired a 3.1% interest in LNEnergy for cash consideration of £250,000 and received options to acquire, at its sole discretion, further shares in LNEnergy. In June 2023, Reabold exercised certain of these options to increase the Company's stake in LNEnergy to 16.2% through a cash consideration of £500,000 and the issuance of 810,810,811 new ordinary shares as consideration for the increased investment. In September 2023, Reabold increased its stake in LNEnergy to 17.6% for a further cash consideration of £250,000. In November 2023, Reabold increased its interest in LNENergy by 0.8% to 18.4% through a partial exercise of the remaining option for a cash consideration of £150,000. In December 2023, Reabold exercised the remainder of the final option to increase its stake in LNEnergy to 26.1% through a cash consideration of £750,000 and the issuance of 486,486,487 new ordinary shares as consideration for the increased investment.

LNEnergy's primary asset is an exclusive option over a 90% interest in the onshore Colle Santo gas field in Abruzzo, Italy. With 65bcf of 2P reserves, as estimated by RPS as of 30 September 2022, this is a highly material undeveloped onshore gas resource. Reabold believes this is the largest onshore proven undeveloped gas field in mainland Western Europe. The field is development ready subject to permits and approvals. Two wells have already been drilled and are available for production, with no additional drilling being required. The development will consist of a small-scale LNG facility to produce initially at 10mmcf/d from the existing two wells with over 20 years of ultimate production. LNEnergy believes that the field has the potential to generate an estimated €11-12m of gross post-tax free cash flow per annum. First gas is targeted for 2025.

Demand for LNG is expected to continue to grow. LNG is critical to the energy transition and plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a less carbon-intensive alternative, and provides grid stability alongside wind and solar power in electricity generation. The Italian government has recently approved a decree, which was converted into law in February 2024, to boost the country's renewable energy production and energy security. The decree provides incentives to build plants for energy production from renewable sources, such as the liquefaction of natural gas; the release of new licences for the exploitation of gas fields aimed at providing gas to industries with high gas consumption, at competitive prices; incentives for LNG terminals and incentives for carbon dioxide storage programmes.

In August 2023, Reabold announced that LNEnergy had received a letter from the head of the Italian National Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Georesources (""UNMIG""), the minerals division of Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security (""MASE""), giving permission to carry out well integrity and well service testing on the two existing wells and to start work on the installation and commissioning of the monitoring network at the Colle Santo gas field. The letter is a positive indication of support for the development of the Colle Santo gas field and the next stage is to receive a formal decree from MASE to conduct the work.

In December 2023, LNEnergy reported that it had filed the Environmental Impact Study (""EIS"") for the new small-scale LNG development plan at the Colle Santo gas field with MASE. This is a further step towards achieving the granting of a production concession at Colle Santo. The study was performed on behalf of LNEnergy by its technical partner Italfluid, and various subsidiary companies of Italfluid, along with several independent technical specialists.

The Company also notes that LNEnergy's application for concession has been recognised by MASE, as a project that meets the requirements of the Italian government's National Integrated Plan for Energy and Climate and National Plan for Economic Recovery, for which €12 billion in grants and economic incentives have been made available by executive decree.

On 2 May 2024, Reabold announced the execution of a non-binding Heads of Agreement (""HoA"") between Gunvor and LNEnergy for the purchase of LNG by Gunvor from LNEnergy from the Colle Santo gas field. The HoA provides the terms on which Gunvor will purchase LNG from LNEnergy at its planned small-scale LNG production facility at the Colle Santo gas field. Gunvor will purchase approximately 44,000 tonnes of LNG per annum. The point of sale will be the truck loading flange at the small-scale LNG plant, and the LNG will then be delivered by truck in Italy. The price for the LNG will be aligned with the Italian PSV price. The contract term will be for an indefinite period with a minimum term of five years.

The HoA also provides for a potential prepayment by Gunvor for a portion of the first five years of deliveries, with such amounts subject to prepayment being a total of approximately 66,000 tonnes of LNG, or 999,000 MWh. The average forward Italian PSV gas price for the years 2025-2030 is currently approximately €30 / MWh. The prepayment is conditional on agreeing definitive transaction documentation and LNEnergy obtaining the required permits to construct and operate the LNG production facility.

On the basis of the HoA, LNEnergy and Gunvor intend to negotiate a fully-termed LNG sale and purchase agreement over the next six months. During such time, LNEnergy will exclusively discuss the sale and purchase of LNG from Colle Santo with Gunvor, whilst concurrently focusing its efforts on obtaining the required permits to construct and operate the LNG production facility.

Following the receipt of the initial £3.2 million net to Reabold in November 2022, for the sale of Corallian, Reabold received a further £5.2 million in December 2023. In January 2024, Reabold received the final tranche payment, following Shell's receipt of development and production consent for the Victory gas field from the North Sea Transition Authority, taking Reabold's final proceeds for the sale of its 49.99% interest in Corallian to £12.7 million.

Licences retained - P2605, P2504 (both 100%) and P2486 (10%)

In 2023, Reabold relinquished interests in five North Sea licences: (P2464 and P2493 (both 100%), P2332 (30%), P2329 and P2427 (10%)). Reabold relinquished its 36% interest in licence P2478 in March 2024.

Discussions to farm down Reabold's remaining North Sea licences to help fund the de-risking and value creation process continues, however, the energy profits levy and political uncertainty in the UK has created difficulties for the farmout process.

Reabold has a 50.8% equity position in Danube Petroleum Limited (""Danube""), with ASX listed ADX Energy Ltd (""ADX"") holding the remaining 49.2%. Danube has a 100% interest in the Parta exploration and Iecea Mare production licence in Western Romania, which include the IMIC-1 discovery and the IMIC-2 prospect.

During the reporting period, following several positive meetings with the governing authority, ADX has submitted technical and financial documents in relation to the Parta Exploration Licence to the relevant Romanian authorities for the possible extension of the current licence period (note: the validity of the Iecea Mare production licence is 20 years and not affected). The governing authority is the National Agency for Mineral Resources (NAMR) which is supporting the extension which can be granted through a government process. ADX is currently providing several reports to assist NAMR with documenting the extensive past activity with the objective of receiving a de facto waiver on the fulfilment of the obligatory work programme.

With regards to the Iecea Mare Production Licence, ADX has forwarded the 2024 work programme to the government agency and is reviewing options to convert part of the licence into a geothermal prospecting area.

Reabold has a 42% shareholding in Daybreak Oil and Gas Inc (""Daybreak""). Daybreak is an OTC traded oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of onshore crude oil and natural gas, primarily in California. Further details on Daybreak can be found on its website at www.daybreakoilandgas.com/.

The Group's loss for the year ended 31 December 2023 was £7.2 million (2022: £45,000).

The Group incurred a loss of £2.7 million on financial assets (2022: £1.9 million) The loss primarily arose from a decline in the market value of Daybreak's shares (£3.5 million), partly offset by an increase in the fair value of contingent consideration receivable (£0.8 million) from the sale of Corallian in 2022.

Reabold's share of loss of associates was £0.6 million (2022: £1.6 million). The decrease was largely due to the absence of non-cash impairment charges which Corallian had incurred in 2022. See Note 15 for more information.

Reabold received cash proceeds of £5.2 million in 2023 related to the sale of Corallian to Shell in 2022, however the gain on this sale was recorded in 2022, when the sale completed, and as such no gains were recorded in the income statement in 2023. In 2022, the net gains on sale of businesses of £5.0 million related to the gain on sale of Corallian (£7.3 million) offset by a loss on disposal of Reabold California (£2.3 million).

Exploration expenses of £1.6 million were incurred in 2023 (2022: £74,000). The increase in 2023 was principally related to exploration expenditure written off as a result of the relinquishment of several North Sea licences. See Notes 7 and 13 for further details.

Administrative expenses for the year were £2.2 million (2022: £1.7 million). The increase was mainly driven by an increase in legal fees in relation to the step acquisitions of LNEnergy, as well as inflationary impacts across the majority of suppliers.

In 2023, Reabold incurred £190,000 (2022: £191,000) in legal and professional fees, which Rebold has classified as non-underlying items, in relation to the successful defence from a second attempt, from a group of beneficial shareholders, to remove the entire Board of Directors of Reabold and replace them with four new directors. All resolutions proposed by the requisitioning shareholders were rejected at a general meeting held in January 2024 (2022: rejected at a general meeting held in November 2022).

Exploration and evaluation assets increased by £0.2 million from £6.8 million at 31 December 2022 to £7.0 million at 31 December 2023. Additions at West Newton of £0.3 million and the acquisition of four Southern North Sea licences for £1.2 million as part of the acquisition of Simwell Resources were offset by exploration write-offs of £1.4 million.

Investments in associates increased from £22.3 million at year end 2022 to £26.1 million at year end 2023, primarily as a result of the step acquisitions of LNEnergy during the year. See Note 15 for further information.

Other long-term investments decreased by £3.5 million as a result of the decline in value of Daybreak's shares. Other short-term investments decreased from £8.7 million to £4.4 million following the receipt of £5.2 million of contingent consideration for the sale of Corallian to Shell in 2022. The movement in short-term investments also included favourable movements of £0.8 million due to the fair value accounting of contingent consideration. See Note 16 for further information.

The increase in share capital from £9.0 million to £10.6 million arose from shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of Simwell Resources Limited (£0.2 million) and shares issued as part of the investment into LNEnergy (£1.3 million). The decrease in the share premium account from £29.0 million to £1.1 million relates to a capital reduction of £29.4 million, offset by the premium on shares issued as part of the consideration for Simwell Resources Limited (£0.4 million) and the premium on shares issued as part of the investment in LNEnergy (£1.1 million). The capital reduction ensures the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to make distributions to shareholders.

Overall, net assets decreased from £46.5 million at 31 December 2022 to £42.2 million at 31 December 2023.

Net cash used in operating activities was £2.2 million in 2023, compared with £1.8 million in 2022. The net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by administration expenses of £2.2 million.

Cash flow from investing activities was an inflow of £2.3 million, compared with an inflow of £2.4 million in 2022. The cash flow from investing activities in 2023 included cash capital expenditure of £2.9 million (compared with cash capital expenditure of £0.7 million in 2022). The increase in cash capital expenditure was primarily driven by the acquisition of Simwell Resources Limited and the step acquisitions of LNEnergy. Divestment proceeds in 2023 were £5.2 million compared with £3.2 million in 2022 - both amounts relate to cash receipts from the sale of Corallian to Shell in 2022.

Cash flow from financing activities in 2023 was an outflow of £0.3 million, compared with nil in 2022, due to the repurchase of shares in 2023.

Cash and cash equivalents were £5.4 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: £5.5 million). The Group has no debt.

The Group does not have any signed contractual capital commitments as at 31 December 2023 (2022: nil), however the group does have obligations to carry out defined work programmes on its licences, under the terms of the award of rights to these licences. The Company is not obliged to meet other joint venture partner shares of these programmes.

PEDL 183

The joint operation between Rathlin, Reabold and Union Jack have a commitment to drill and test a new Kirkham Abbey deviated or horizontal appraisal well by June 2024. The joint venture has also committed to recomplete or sidetrack and test one of the WNA-1, WNA-2 or WNB-1Z wells in that same timeframe. The Company estimates its 16.67% share of costs for these commitments to be c.£2.2 million. Rathlin, the operator of PEDL183, is working with the NSTA to defer these commitments to allow the time necessary for Rathlin to obtain sufficient funding for its share of the commitments.

UK North Sea

Reabold estimates its share of firm exploration and appraisal work commitments on its North Sea portfolio to be c.£50,000 over the course of 2024. The Company has not yet taken a decision on whether to drill on any of its North Sea licences.

Reabold operates in an environment subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. The Board regularly considers the principal risks to which the Group is exposed and monitors any agreed mitigating actions. The overall strategy for the protection of shareholder value against these risks is to carry a broad portfolio of assets with varied risk/reward profiles, and to retain adequate working capital. The risks faced by the Company can, and are likely to, change with progress in the Company's strategy and developments in the external business environment.

The risks discussed below, separately or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the implementation of our strategy, our business, financial performance, liquidity, prospects, shareholder value and returns and reputation.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Statement

Reabold is committed to the highest standards of environmental, social and governance processes and we incorporate these responsibilities into our operational decision-making and investments. We regularly review our approach, policies, and processes across key areas.

At present Reabold does not 'operate' any of the assets in its portfolio. Our operational assets are managed by our associate companies who are responsible for the adequacy of standards, operations and compliance. The Group does not have any assets that are yet in the development or production stage and therefore the business has no scope 1 or scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.

Reabold is committed to preserving and protecting our natural environment for future generations.

Reabold complies with the standards of the international oil industry, environmental laws and regulations. We recognise and support the basis of the Paris Agreement to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.

We support a balanced energy transition where the world maintains a secure and affordable supply of energy, while building the clean energy system of the future. Our focus is on minimising carbon emissions and the environmental footprint of the projects we invest in, whilst continuing to contribute positively to the demand for energy and products that require hydrocarbons in the supply chain. The pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and cleaner fuels is uncertain, and will be heavily influenced by government policy, but oil and natural gas demand is expected to remain a key element of the energy mix for many years based on stated government policies, commitments and announced pledges to reduce emissions. The challenge is to meet the world's energy needs sustainably and efficiently, which requires managing and reducing harmful emissions.

Reabold actively encourages and expects its investee companies / operators of its oil and gas interests to respond to this by continuously striving to minimise the potential environmental impact of operations by:

· Implementing controls to identify and prevent potential environmental risks

· Implementing controls during operations to avoid accidental spills, or leaks of polluting materials

· Managing water with due consideration

· Targeting high energy efficiency levels in drilling and other activities

· Limiting unnecessary wastage

· Handling waste products in an environmentally responsible manner

· Regularly assessing the environmental consequences of operations

The operators have developed systems, controls and processes to integrate climate related considerations, in order to meet these objectives. For example one can read the approach and policies of Rathlin Energy, operator of the West Newton PEDL 183 licence, on its website at www.rathlin-energy.co.uk, and of LNEnergy, operator of the Colle Santo project in Italy, on its website at https://www.sviluppocollesanto.it/.

Focus on energy efficient extraction and drilling to reduce carbon intensity

Reabold's assets are primarily small to medium sized, proven oil and gas fields at relatively shallow depth. As such, the intensity of drilling required is considered low relative to industry standards and we do not conduct energy intensive prospecting activities, reducing the impact on the environment. We encourage the operators of our assets to use the most energy efficient drilling methods. As the energy mix evolves towards a higher percentage of renewables in the countries in which we operate, we anticipate a greater share of our energy consumption will be purchased from green sources.

Our investee company sites in the United Kingdom are located close to areas with a high demand for energy. Consequently, we expect that hydrocarbons produced locally and consumed locally will displace imported hydrocarbons thereby resulting in lower carbon emissions overall. This will provide greater security of supply to the UK as well as providing jobs and supporting UK industry, compared to the alternative of importing fuel. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of our critical national infrastructure and, more recently, the war in Ukraine has been a stark reminder that energy security cannot be taken for granted.

We believe that natural gas has an important role to play in the energy transition, bridging the gap on the journey from fossil fuels to a renewable, zero-carbon future and helping to supply stable and affordable energy to UK homes and businesses as part of a lower-carbon energy supply mix. To that end, we continue to explore ways to invest in gas projects such as the Victory project, which was subsequently sold to Shell in November 2022, and the Colle Santo gas project in Italy.

Reabold takes its commitment to responsible hydrocarbon production very seriously. In May 2024, Reabold commissioned GaffneyCline to perform a carbon intensity study for the West Newton field. The GaffneyCline study highlighted the following:

· The West Newton project has an AA rating for Carbon Intensity for its potential upstream gas and condensate production, the lowest possible carbon intensity rating category on GaffneyCline's scale

· The West Newton field has a Carbon Intensity significantly lower than the UK average and onshore and offshore analogues. It is also significantly lower than the average imported LNG, based on the NSTA Natural Carbon Footprint Analysis published in July 2023

· Based on the study, GaffneyCline estimates that West Newton could produce the equivalent of just 2.87 grams of CO2 per megajoule of energy developed (gCO2eq./MJ)

· As the development proceeds and project knowledge increases, there is potential to improve the Carbon Intensity by further reducing fugitive, flaring and venting emissions and by gas-to-grid development, reducing on site gas and condensate processing, and using the shortest possible route to the National Grid

The AA rating demonstrates the low carbon credentials of the West Newton project and is an example of the opportunities available in the UK to power the country through lower carbon, home grown energy, rather than relying on expensive and more carbon intensive imports.

We believe West Newton is an important strategic asset to the UK as the country looks to secure domestic energy supply for secure and affordable energy, at a time when the country is exposed to potentially significant gas supply disruptions. The study proves that the operator, Rathlin, is a responsible hydrocarbon producer complying with best environmental practice to produce much needed UK hydrocarbons in the most efficient and environmentally friendly way possible.

Reabold is committed to the highest standards of environmental processes and we incorporate these responsibilities into our operational decision-making and investments.

The development plan for Colle Santo involves converting gas to LNG directly onsite using a small modular LNG processing unit. The LNG will be trucked a short distance (7 km) to an entry point into the SNAM transmission grid. There will be no new drilling due to two existing wells already drilled and tested. There will be on-site CO capture of 1,400 tonnes CO equivalent per year, and connected hydrogen production facilities.

LNG provides energy security and flexibility because it can be easily transported to places where it is needed most. LNG is a critical fuel in the energy transition and plays an important role as a lower-carbon alternative to coal for industry, and provides grid stability alongside wind and solar power in electricity generation. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity.

Daybreak's production sites are located in California, a state with very high renewable energy generation which feeds into the energy required for hydrocarbon extraction. By industry standards, Daybreak's oil and gas activities require a very low level of energy to extract the hydrocarbons, ensuring it is one of the most energy efficient of its type in California.

Romania has a diverse energy mix, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable sources. The largest share of electricity production historically came from coal and natural gas, followed by hydroelectric and nuclear power. In recent years, there has been a shift towards increasing the share of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. However, Romania supports natural gas in the long-term in the European Green Deal because it forecasts that this resource will remain an important tool in changing the energy sector and transitioning to a more sustainable and carbon-free economy. By developing and producing gas from the Parta site, Danube Petroleum Limited will be able to contribute to the country's efforts to implement this energy strategy. In addition, options to exploit the geothermal potential of the Romanian part of the Pannonian Basin are under investigation with the authorities in combination with a subsurface review of the likely prospectivity.

Managing our environmental footprint and reducing our emissions are important objectives for Reabold Resources. We regularly review and revise our policies, as necessary.

Reabold wishes to build value through developing sustainable relationships with partners and the community.

We comply with all applicable legislation; and design and manage our activities to prevent pollution, minimize environmental and health impact and provide workplaces free of safety hazards.

The Company is committed to high standards of health, safety and environmental protection; these aspects command equal prominence with other business considerations in the decision-making process.

Health, safety and environmental protection are responsibilities shared by everyone working for the Company and the full support of all staff, partners and contractors is vital to the successful implementation of the policy. We ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that all personnel are aware of their delegated health, safety and environmental responsibilities and are properly trained to undertake these.

We strive for continuous improvement in our HSE performance and measure this by setting objectives and targets consistent with the aims of this policy.

HSE performance is routinely monitored and reported regularly to the Board of Directors, which will ensure that the necessary resources are provided to support this policy fully.

As an AIM-quoted company, Reabold is required to apply a recognised corporate governance code, demonstrating how the Company complies with such corporate governance code and where it departs from it.

The Directors of the Company have formally applied the 2018 QCA Code. The Board recognises the principles of the 2018 QCA Code, which focus on the creation of medium to long-term value for shareholders without stifling the entrepreneurial spirit in which small to medium sized companies, such as Reabold, have been created. Please see pages 25 to 30 for the Chair's corporate governance statement and how Reabold has applied the 10 principles of the 2018 QCA code.

In accordance with the requirements of Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors consider that, during the financial year ended 31 December 2023, they have acted in a way that they consider, in good faith, would most likely promote the success of the Company for the benefit of the members as a whole, having regard to the likely consequences of any decision in the long term and the broader interests of other stakeholders, as required by the Act. The Board delegates day-to-day management of the business of the Company to the Co-CEOs, save for those matters which are reserved for the Board's approval. More information on how the Board has regard to the Section 172 factors are outlined below.

S172(1) (a) ""The likely consequences of any decision in the long term""

The Directors understand the business and both the evolving and challenging environment in which we operate, including the challenges of the global energy transition. The Board made decisions with regard to acquisitions and investments with consideration given to key stakeholders and the likely long-term impact of any decision. During the year, the Board reflected on the challenges to be faced by Reabold given the shifting macroeconomic and geopolitical context. Our strategy is intended to transition Reabold to an energy business focused on developing strategic European gas assets to secure European gas supply and energy security. The Board of Directors is collectively responsible for the decisions made towards the long-term success of the Company and the way in which the strategic, operational and risk management decisions have been implemented throughout the business is detailed in our Strategy and business model on page 4 and throughout the Strategic Report.

S172(1) (b) ""The interests of the Company's employees""

Reabold employees are fundamental and core to our business model and the delivery of our strategic ambitions. The future success of our business depends on attracting, retaining, developing and motivating talented employees.

We ensure that:

* Health, Safety and the Environment are considered paramount throughout the organisation.

* Annual pay and benefit reviews are carried out to determine whether all levels of employees are benefitting fairly and to retain and encourage skills vital for the business.

* There are freely available Company policies and procedures.

* Personal development reviews and work appraisals are conducted.

* Employees are informed of the results and important business decisions and are encouraged to feel engaged

The Remuneration Committee oversees and makes recommendations of executive remuneration and any long-term share awards. In April 2023, we launched the Reabold Resources plc long-term incentive plan for our full-time senior management team. Reabold aims to invest in competitive rewards for our people.

S172(1) (c) ""The need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others""

Delivering our strategy requires strong mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers, customers, governments, and joint-venture partners. We aim to have a positive and enduring impact on the communities in which we operate, through partnering with national and local suppliers, and through payments to governments in taxes and other fees. The Group values all of its suppliers and aims to build strong positive relationships through open communication and adherence to trade terms. The Group is committed to being a responsible entity and doing the right thing for its customers, suppliers and business partners. The Board upholds ethical business behaviour across all of the Company's activities and encourages management to seek comparable business practices from all suppliers and customers doing business with the Company. We value the feedback we receive from our stakeholders and we take every opportunity to ensure that where possible their wishes are duly considered. The Board engages with stakeholders to understand their priorities and concerns through a range of engagement activities. Meeting commitments made to investors is critical to building trust and confidence with our external stakeholders. Back in 2022, management made a commitment to improve communication with shareholders with stakeholder engagements at least every two months. This has taken the form of corporate presentations, interviews with the Co-CEOs and investor events. In 2023, we published 12 new videos on the media section of our website, including operational updates, investor presentations and Q&As. In Q1 2023 the Company launched a new website so that shareholders and other stakeholders can more easily navigate Company updates and communications. The website includes a Q&A page which answers some of the most common investor questions.

The Co-CEOs provide a comprehensive update to the Board on material business and external developments at each main Board meeting. This includes significant operational updates, e.g. partnerships, investments, divestments, projects, commercial highlights and political or regulatory developments.

S172(1) (d) ""The impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment""

This aspect is inherent in our strategic ambitions, most notably on our ambitions to thrive through the energy transition and to sustain a strong societal licence to operate. As such, the Board receives information on these topics to provide relevant information for specific Board decisions. Executive Directors conduct site visits of various investee company operations and hold external stakeholder engagements, where feasible.

At present Reabold does not 'operate' any of the assets in its portfolio. Our operational assets are managed by our associate companies who are responsible for the adequacy of standards, operations and compliance. Reabold seeks to influence how risk is managed in arrangements where we are not operator by ensuring we have a member of the executive team on the Board of our associate companies. This gives Reabold assurance that operations are and will be carried out in a sustainable and safe manner.

Further information can be found within our ESG Statement on page 15, and within the principal risks and uncertainties section on page 12.

S172(1) (e) ""The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct""

The Company is incorporated in the UK and governed by the Companies Act 2006. The Company has adopted the Quoted Companies Alliance (""QCA"") Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the ""2018 QCA Code"") and the Board recognises the importance of maintaining a good level of corporate governance, which together with the requirements to comply with the AIM Rules ensures that the interests of the Company's stakeholders are safeguarded. Please see the Chair's Corporate Governance statement on pages 25 to 30.

Reabold aims to contribute to Europe's energy security by unlocking potential sources of near-term domestic gas supply in economically, environmentally and socially responsible ways. The Board periodically reviews and approves clear frameworks, such as Reabold's Code of Conduct, and specific Ethics & Compliance policies, to ensure that its high standards are maintained both within Reabold and the business relationships we maintain. This, complemented by the various ways the Board is informed and monitors compliance with relevant governance standards help ensure its decisions are taken, and that Reabold investee companies act, in ways that promote high standards of business conduct.

S172(1) (f) ""The need to act fairly as between members of the Company""

The Directors consider which course of action best enables delivery of our strategy in the long-term interest of the Company. The Board is committed to maintaining good communication and having constructive dialogue with its shareholders. The Company has close ongoing relationships with its shareholders - engaging with both retail and institutional holders during 2023. Institutional shareholders and analysts have the opportunity to discuss issues and provide feedback at meetings with the Company. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company's Annual General Meeting and any general meetings held by the Company, which present an opportunity for shareholders to speak with the Executive Directors in a formal environment and in more informal one to one meetings.

The primary communication tool with our shareholders is through the Regulatory News Service (""RNS"") on regulatory matters and matters of material substance. The Company's upgraded website, launched in March 2023, provides details of the business, investor presentations and details of the Board, changes to major shareholder information and 2018 QCA Code disclosure updates under AIM Rule 26. Changes are promptly published on the website to enable the shareholders to be kept abreast of Company's affairs. The Company's Annual Report and Notice of Annual General Meetings are available to all shareholders. The Interim Report and investor presentations are also available on our website.

Investor events are held with shareholders throughout the year. By providing a variety of ways to communicate with investors the Company feels that it reaches out to engage with a wide range of its stakeholders.

The Board delegates day-to-day management of the business of the Company to the Co-CEOs. The responsibility for the execution of this delegation of authority, including regularly monitoring it, is retained by the Board. We outline some of the principal decisions made by the Board over the year, and how directors have performed their duty under Section 172.

Cash allocation including shareholder distributions

Following the completion of the sale of Corallian in November 2022 along with the receipt of the first tranche payment from Shell, the board considered cash flow, the macro environment and business performance in 2023. The Directors approved a share buyback programme in April 2023 with the aim of delivering value to shareholders. The Directors considered its ordinary shares to be undervalued and at a meaningful discount to conservatively estimated per-share intrinsic value.

A number of considerations underpinned the decision to commence the buyback programme including feedback from advisors and other stakeholders, the strength of the Company's balance sheet and the need to continue to invest in our assets.",investegate.co.uk,news,investegate.co.uk,,0.4352941176470588,454831780,82,https://www.investegate.co.uk/assets/images/linkedin-investegate-logo.jpg,

English, German and French are sung in the famed composition, almost perfectly encapsulating this year's final. Wembley Stadium in England is the setting for Germany's Borussia Dortmund to face... Spain's Real Madrid. So close.

Of course, Madrid are in the final yet again. This will be their eighth appearance in the Champions League decider since the turn of the century as they look to extend their dominance of the competition with a 15th European title (only one other club, AC Milan of Italy, has even managed seven) -- and their sixth in 10 years.

Even the kindest statistical models and betting companies have Madrid as overwhelming favourites to get their hands on the trophy Manchester City lifted last year, but Dortmund have been writing a compelling underdog story in Europe this season where its last chapter be the best one of the lot.

Who will be most threatening in transition? Can Dortmund keep Madrid's left flank quiet? Is this the most balanced Madrid side in recent memory?

Allow The Athletic to provide a definitive preview of the 2023-24 Champions League final...

Borussia Dortmund will be looking to exorcise some demons as they return to Wembley for another Champions League final 11 years after their 2-1 defeat to fellow Germans Bayern Munich there in the 2012-13 fixture, when a team managed by Jurgen Klopp was undone by a late Arjen Robben winner.

Dortmund fans will be hoping Edin Terzic's side present the European version of themselves on Saturday night rather than this season's comparably disappointing domestic one. It has been a confusing season for the club, reaching the Champions League final but finishing fifth in the Bundesliga, 26 points adrift of title winners Bayer Leverkusen.

Even looking beyond their points tally, Dortmund's expected goal difference -- which measures the quality of chances a side has created and conceded -- of 0.3 per 90 minutes was also fifth-best in the German top flight.

Their Jekyll-and-Hyde season was best encapsulated during the week they qualified for the Champions League final, following up a 2-0 aggregate victory over French champions Paris Saint-Germain with a 3-0 loss against relegation candidates Mainz just four days later.

That is not to say that the omens should be against Dortmund, as there have been plenty of sides who have struggled domestically but become a different animal on the European stage -- Liverpool (2004-05), Chelsea (2011-12), and Madrid themselves (1997-98 and 1999-2000) being the most salient examples in recent times.

Dortmund did not just scrape through the competition's Group of Death containing PSG, Newcastle United and AC Milan -- they won it, making their navigation through the knockout phase comparably easier than what was happening on the other side of the draw.

PSV Eindhoven (round of 16), Atletico Madrid (quarter-final) and PSG all provided stern tests across two legs, but there is little doubt that Terzic's side earned a kinder route to the final after that tricky group stage.

Dortmund's journey to Wembley has been underpinned by their collective effort. Terzic's side have spread the goals around when on the European stage, with 12 players contributing to their total of 17 -- Niclas Fullkrug leads the way with just three.

After an initial shift to a back three for their first group game against PSG, Dortmund have largely set up in a 4-2-3-1 shape in their 12 European fixtures this season so far. Emre Can will often drop between the centre-backs in build-up, allowing the full-backs to have a higher starting position as the other midfielders -- typically Marcel Sabitzer and Julian Brandt -- rotate vertically and their wide players stay on the last line of the opposition defence.

Fullkrug has been the one to spearhead the attack, with pace in wide areas being provided by Karim Adeyemi, Donyell Malen and, in the knockout phase, a rejuvenated Jadon Sancho, who rejoined the club in January on loan from Manchester United, two and a half years after leaving for Old Trafford.

A lot of Dortmund's threat in that semi-final against PSG came through Sancho -- particularly in the first leg at home. The 24-year-old's 18 attempted take-ons that night were the second most by any player in a single game in the Champions League this season, with his 12 completed dribbles being the most from any individual in a Champions League semi-final since Lionel Messi in 2008 (for Barcelona against Manchester United).

Sancho's ""cage football"" style comes alive when Dortmund tap into their transitional attacking approach. Even accounting for the number of games played, their direct attacks (as a proxy of counter-attacking play) have been among the highest in this year's Champions League. Particularly during the knockout stage, it has been Sancho and Adeyemi -- often found by the attacking creativity of Brandt -- who have led the charge on goal.

Unfortunately for Terzic's side, they are up against an equally transitional side in Madrid, whose six goals from fast breaks in Europe -- more than any other team -- outline just how punishing they can be when a match opens up. If the final descends into a basketball-style game of back-and-forth, you would suspect it will suit the 14-time European champions a little more.

Dortmund are likely to need those pacy wingers to tuck in and drop back to support their full-backs, in the same manner that they did in the second leg against PSG in Paris. It was not uncommon to see Dortmund forming a situational back five at times that night, as Adeyemi...

...and Sancho had the defensive awareness to counteract the threat of the opposition wingers by condensing the space in wide areas.

Out of possession, Dortmund's success in this year's competition has been grounded in their defensive solidity and compactness, having conceded just nine goals in their 12 matches and kept six clean sheets -- their most in the Champions League since 1997-98, when they were defending their European title and got to the semi-finals before losing to... Real Madrid.

Sure, they might have ridden their luck at times, with PSG hitting the woodwork on six occasions without scoring once across the two semi-final legs. Yes, PSG's second-leg xG tally of 3.3 was the highest of any team in the Champions League this season without finding the net. But in knockout competitions, a dollop of luck is par for the course, and Dortmund earned theirs with some staunch defending led by one man in particular -- Mats Hummels.

No player logged more than Hummels' 10 clearances, four tackles and three interceptions during the semi-final's second leg, and his headed goal that night made him the oldest German (aged 35 years and 143 days) to score a goal in a Champions League knockout match.

Hummels and fellow stalwart Marco Reus, who is leaving the club this summer, are the only remaining players who played for Dortmund in the 2013 final (Hummels had three seasons with Bayern in between but returned in 2019), and they will be hoping to exonerate the ill-feeling of that loss at Wembley more than a decade on.

That defensive compactness led by Hummels will be crucial if they are to find a way to win against Madrid.

Expect to see plenty of examples below of their tight shape, with Terzic empowering his team to be comfortable out of possession and ready to spring a counter-attack when the moment is right.

What might make that difficult is that their illustrious opponents have more than one way of breaking you down.

If you glance through Madrid's goals in this year's competition, you would struggle to find too much of a pattern in the way they score. Cutbacks, counter-attacks, long-rangers, headers, moments of individual brilliance, they are all there, and do you know what the best part is? They don't even need to be playing well to score.

Madrid thrive in moments of suffering, and it feels as though so many of their goals have come against the run of play, having arguably ridden their luck for long periods in each of their knockout tie against RB Leipzig, Manchester City and Bayern.

You know the script by now, but Carlo Ancelotti's side have a knack for making the unpredictable... well, predictable. Just when the opposition feel like they have Madrid in a chokehold, they find a way to wriggle out. Like any James Bond film, you know what is going to happen, but it does not make watching it unfold any less exciting.

This makes it rather difficult to offer too many reliable tactical patterns, but Ancelotti's use of a 4-4-2 diamond in possession has allowed plenty of rotations at the top end of the field. Unsurprisingly, those rotations are skewed towards the left flank.

In the Champions League this season, 42 per cent of Madrid's attacking touches have been channelled down their left third of the pitch as Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo take it in turns to face up and torment the opposition full-back.

No player has attempted more take-ons than Vinicius Jr's 184 since the start of last season, so you can understand why his team-mates will look to him to cause havoc -- but that left-sided dominance is not just about their No 7.

Of course, there will be occasions where it is best to give Vinicius Jr the space and freedom to attack on his own and isolate opposition defenders before darting past them. In the second of their semi-final with Bayern at the Bernabeu, the 23-year-old's 14 take-ons were comfortably more than he's had in any other Champions League game all season, as he had the beating of right-back Joshua Kimmich.

However, Madrid will also overload that left side with their best technical players as they bounce the ball through the lines and bear down on goal.

You will be equally likely to see Toni Kroos pull into the left half-space, with Rodrygo pulling to that touchline as Vinicius Jr rolls inside, while Jude Bellingham will drift over to support with runs that often drag opposition defenders with him.

That trio of Bellingham, Vinicius Jr and Rodrgyo have undoubtedly been Madrid's strongest attacking players this season. Our eyes can see it, and statistical models seemingly support it.

Twenty First Group is a sports intelligence firm that advises clubs, leagues and investors, and its player model generates ratings for over 145,000 players worldwide across 250 competitions. These ratings are calculated based on factors such as the strength of a player's team, their position, their playing time, and their contribution towards their team's attack or defence.

Analysing the distribution of these ratings across this year's Madrid squad -- with a minimum of 180 La Liga minutes played -- is rather revealing.

The boxplot graphic below shows this spread of ratings, with the white line reflecting the average player rating in the squad, with most of its members falling within the middle 50 per cent of the group (shown by the gold box).

Interestingly, that quality gap from Dani Ceballos (lowest rating) to Vinicius Jr (highest rating) is notably small when compared with previous Madrid squads across the past decade.

Based on Twenty First Group's model, Madrid's 2014-15 iteration had the strongest average player quality, with this year's squad only good enough to be their sixth-best since 2013-14 -- and the fourth-best one to reach a Champions League final. However, this year's distribution of ratings (based on the standard deviation, for those wondering) is the most well-balanced it has been across this period, shown by the tighter boxplot below.

Losing Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema in recent years will undoubtedly weaken any side, but Ancelotti has overseen a rebuild that is packed with youthful exuberance and high technical quality, even as the likes of Kroos and Luka Modric sail off into the sunset.

""The attitude and commitment (of the players) has allowed us to have a fantastic season,"" Ancelotti said this week. ""There's also individual quality, but (Madrid great Alfredo) Di Stefano's quote ('No player is as good as everyone combined') is the best quote.""

For a club synonymous with signing galacticos and superstars to wear a white shirt, having the highest floor has been as important as having the highest ceiling among Madrid's latest generation -- with Ceballos being the best ""weakest player"" of any Madrid squad in the past 12 seasons, according to Twenty First Group's player rating model.

Sure, one of Vinicius Jr, Bellingham and Rodrygo is likely to grab the headlines on Saturday, but there is a steeliness to Madrid that runs right through the squad.

It is a key reason why their Bond-esque escapology acts have become so normalised.",nytimes.com,news,The New York Times,Mark Carey,0.2078431372549019,454824754,1,https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/30101411/3005_CLdatapreview.jpg,eng-9613014

Here is the competition's star-studded top scorers list.

Highlights There have been 16 editions of the European Championships since the competition's inception in 1960. Only one player in Euros history has ever amassed more than nine goals at the tournament. Germany are the most prolific nation in the competition's history, yet lack a single player with more than five goals on the continental stage. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

The European Championship does not boast the same global prestige as the World Cup, football's ultimate prize. But the condensed quality of its participants, particularly before the tournament was expanded to the current 24-team format, makes the Euros fiendishly competitive.

Two decades had elapsed since the competition's inception before the Euros invited more than four teams to the finals. This streamlined setup, coupled with the four-year gap between editions, ensured that very few players were able to rack up a healthy goal tally. Only one player since UEFA launched the tournament in 1960 has amassed double digits for total strikes.

In this realm of fine margins and few goals, one efficient summer will rarely be enough to figure in the list of all-time top scorers. Here are the players who recorded the most goals in Euros history by largely maintaining a prolific edge across multiple tournaments.

When a 39-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimovic was recalled to the Swedish national team ahead of Euro 2020, he described it as ""the return of the God"". The towering striker wasn't always an endless pit of pithy one-liners. When Ibrahimovic bagged his second goal of Euro 2004 to snatch a dramatic draw against Italy, he shrugged: ""It could have been anyone.""

This rare act of humility was misplaced. Precious few players on the planet, let alone in the Sweden squad, could have pulled off the flying back-heel which Ibrahimovic arced into the far corner. The former AC Milan and Manchester United forward became increasingly frustrated with his international colleagues as Sweden failed to make it beyond the group stage of three consecutive European Championships between 2008 and 2016.

Heading into his first European Championships at the turn of the century, Thierry Henry had only scored two goals for France since winning the 1998 World Cup. Left on the bench for the final against Brazil, the Premier League icon was shunted back into the under-21 squad for the entirety of 1999.

An impressive debut campaign at Arsenal earned Henry a recall which he emphatically made the most of. Prowling in front of Zinedine Zidane, Henry scored three times as France defeated a star-studded list of opponents in a triumphant sequence which he described as ""like some type of Hollywood script"".

Romelu Lukaku was a spell-binding prodigy at club level. The former Anderlecht striker made his professional debut 11 days after turning 16, coming off the bench in a Championship play-off final to decide the 2009 Belgian champion. But it was more of a slow burn for the international team.

After racking up 11 goals in his first six years playing for the Red Devils, Lukaku embarked upon a staggering sequence between the European Championships of 2016 and 2020. Despite scoring 53 goals in 56 caps, including six in tournament football, Lukaku was not able to steer his richly talented generation of compatriots beyond the quarter-finals.

9 Nuno Gomes - 6 Portugal

Nuno Gomes holds the rare - and unwanted distinction - of being the only player in the history of the European Championships to have scored and earned a red card in the same game. The early Alice-band advocate put Portugal in front against France in the semi-finals of Euro 2000 before becoming embroiled in one of the most controversial moments the tournament has ever witnessed.

Gomes was one of three Portuguese players sent off during the protestations against a penalty which Zinedine Zidane would score to win the knockout tie. The striker's shove on referee Gunter Benko earned him an eight-month UEFA ban. Gomes had slid down Portugal's pecking order but returned to find the net in 2004 and 2008.

8 Wayne Rooney - 6 England

According to Wayne Rooney, he was ""not a natural goalscorer"". This didn't stop him from finishing his career as the most prolific player in the history of Manchester United and England's national team. The zenith of Rooney's career undoubtedly came at Euro 2004.

I remember in that tournament, at 18, thinking: 'I'm the best player in the world, there's no one better than me.' And I believe, at that time, I was.

England's teenage tyro lived up to the comparisons with Pele which had been made by England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, bullying the continent's best players with consecutive group-stage braces. Rooney's golden summer was brought to a screeching halt by injury in the quarter-finals against Portugal, and he only managed two more Euros goals. Imagine how many he could have scored if he had been a natural.

Manchester United pulled out of a move to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy two months before the start of Euro 2000 as they were unconvinced by the strength of his knee. The PSV Eindhoven forward promptly suffered cruciate ligament damage and missed the entire tournament. After joining United 12 months later, Van Nistelrooy's four goals at Euro 2004 helped the Netherlands advance to the semi-finals before coming unstuck against host nation Portugal.

The prolific poacher only scored one of his 150 competitive goals for United from outside the 18-yard box and proved even more reliant upon close-range finishes on the continental stage. The only one of Van Nistelrooy's six Euro goals that came from beyond the six-yard area was a penalty.

6 Alvaro Morata - 6 Spain

Alvaro Morata may be the most prolific Spanish player in European Championship history, but he hasn't received the public support to go alongside such an impressive status. The perennially morose forward who scored three goals at Euro 2016 was booed throughout the group stage of Euro 2020 which Spain played in front of their own fans.

Even Morata's wife and children - who committed the heinous act of wearing shirts with their family name on the back - were verbally abused by fans in the stadium. The embattled Spaniard couldn't sleep after missing a penalty against Slovakia but insisted he was ""motivated"" by the wretched reaction from his compatriots. Morata duly knocked out Croatia in the round of 16 with a late winner and came off the bench to equalise against Italy in the semi-finals. The critics would have the last laugh, though, as Morata failed to convert his spot kick in the subsequent shootout.

5 Patrick Kluivert - 6 Netherlands

Only three players in the history of the men's Dutch national team have scored more goals than Patrick Kluivert. The jet-heeled striker's record is made all the more impressive by the fact that not a single one of his 40 strikes came from the penalty spot. Though that wasn't for a lack of trying, Kluivert missed the two penalties he took at international level.

The former Ajax Champions League winner had scored 15 goals in as many internationals heading into the Euro 2000 semi-final against Italy. Despite losing Gianluca Zambrotta to a red card after 34 minutes, Italy valiantly kept the game goalless until winning the penalty shootout. After watching Frank de Boer fail to convert from 12 yards in the first half of normal time, Kluivert struck the woodwork with his own spot kick after the interval. The tournament's Golden Boot winner was the only Dutch player to score in the subsequent shootout as Italy advanced to a final against France.

4 Antoine Griezmann - 7 France

There's little doubt as to how highly Didier Deschamps rates Antoine Griezmann. The World Cup-winning French manager played the ephemeral forward in 84 internationals on the spin between 2017 and 2024. After Griezmann broke Patrick Vieira's record for consecutive French starts, Deschamps hailed his star pupil as ""one of the greatest players of all time, both in Europe and worldwide"".

Griezmann's value to Deschamps stretches far beyond his goal record. The Atletico Madrid icon finished as top scorer at Euro 2016 with six goals before only finding the net once in the competition four years later. Yet there was scarcely any criticism of Griezmann at Euro 2020 as he produced another tournament display littered with creativity and a selfless defensive work ethic.

Heading into England's home tournament of Euro 1996, Alan Shearer hadn't scored for his country in almost two years and 12 games. Rob Lee, Graeme Le Saux and Nick Barmby had all found the net more recently than the nation's first-choice striker. But manager Terry Venables was adamant that the Newcastle United number nine would lead the line in the opening game against Switzerland.

Shearer rewarded Venables' faith with the first of five goals during that glorious summer, finishing as the tournament's top scorer. The most prolific player in Premier League history would never again have his position questioned, becoming England captain after the competition.

2 Michel Platini - 9 France

Few players in football history have enjoyed a major tournament as comprehensively dominant as Michel Platini's evisceration of all before him at Euro 1984. The French box-crashing midfielder was the ruthless edge of an immensely talented side which romped to victory on home soil.

Platini scored in all five matches, including a pair of perfect hat-tricks - comprising a goal with both feet and a header - in the space of four days. No other player in the history of the competition has ever scored more than one treble. Zinedine Zidane, acting as a ball boy on his 12th birthday, watched Platini deliver a 119th-minute winner in the semi-final against Portugal before the ruthless finisher downed Spain with the opening goal of the final.

Lothar Matthaus appeared for Germany in the most recent European Championships which Cristiano Ronaldo missed. One of the greatest players of all time has been an immovable fixture of the continental competition since helping Portugal reach the final of their home tournament in 2004, when his nation lost to shock finalists Greece after a tearful Ronaldo squandered his side's best chances.

Ronaldo's second appearance in a Euros final also inspired some waterworks. Portugal's sobbing talisman was stretchered off in the 2016 showpiece against France with a sprained knee. Ronaldo reappeared with plenty of strapping and even more words of encouragement, barking orders from the sidelines next to his manager Fernando Santos. The competition's all-time top scorer had to rely upon an unlikely goal from Eder - his first and only at the Euros - to win the tournament.

Salesi"" Children's Hospital, Ancona, Italy, from 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2021, were reviewed. The Ancona NICU is the only referral center for extremely and very preterm infants in the Marche Region, Italy. Exclusion criteria were congenital malformations, weight z-score at birth < -1.282 (small for gestational age, SGA) or > +1.282 (large for gestational age, LGA), outborn or admission to the NICU after 24 h of life, incomplete information on enteral nutrition (EN) intakes from birth to 36 weeks, and death before 36 weeks.

The study cohort was divided into two groups based on the median value of the percent contribution of MOM to cumulative prescribed enteral nutrition volumes: infants with ≥66% were allocated to the high provision of MOM group (H-MOM), and the others to the low provision of MOM group (L-MOM). The H-MOM and L-MOM groups were compared, and the association of H-MOM with BPD and first quartile of SFR (Q1-SFR) at 36 weeks was assessed.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate whether the incidence of BPD (primary outcome) differs between H-MOM and L-MOM preterm infants with a GA between 24 and 31 weeks. As secondary objectives, we evaluated respiratory parameters (fraction inspired oxygen, FiO2; oxygen saturation, SpO2; and SFR), the incidence of other complications of prematurity, and anthropometry at 36 weeks (secondary outcomes) in H-MOM vs L-MOM.

According to the local NICU protocol, preterm infants with a GA of less than 32 weeks and birth weight lower than 1250 g received parenteral nutrition (PN) from birth. As the PN volumes decreased, the EN volumes were gradually increased whenever it was clinically feasible. Preterm infants with a GA of less than 32 weeks and a birth weight greater than 1250 g initiated EN as soon as possible after birth, and the minimal EN volumes were gradually increased until full EN volumes were reached. MOM was the primary choice, while donor human milk and infant milk formulas were used as the secondary alternative when MOM was not available or insufficient to meet the predefined EN supply.

Minimal EN feeding was provided from day 0 to day 7, and then it was gradually increased from day 9 to reach full EN feeds by day 18. EN intake was increased by approximately 20 ml/kg/d to 100 ml/kg/d when fortifier (4% FM85 - Nestle Spa, Milan, Italy) was added from day 15 of life. The fortified EN volumes were advanced by 20 ml/kg/d until 160 ml/kg/d was achieved. The nutritional protocol remained consistent throughout the study period.

Clinical data included in this study were collected from the electronic NICU software (Neotools®; Interactive, Milan, Italy).

Body weight was measured daily using a digital infant scale; total length and head circumference were measured at birth and weekly thereafter using a neonatal stadiometer and a flexible non-stretchable tape, respectively. Standard deviation scores were computed using Italian growth charts [13]. Body weight gain (g/kg/d) was calculated from birth to 36 weeks and from the regained birth weight to 36 weeks [6]. Complications of prematurity were defined according to the Vermont Oxford Network. Sepsis with positive blood culture was classified as early-onset when occurring before 72 h of life, and late-onset when occurring at or after 72 h of life [14]. Necrotizing enterocolitis was defined as Bell stage two or three [15]. BPD was defined by the physiological criteria of Walsh et al. [16] at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age.

Oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (Masimo; Milan, Italy; pre-ductal) and fraction of inspired oxygen as indicated by ventilators, continuous positive airway pressure devices, or hood oximeters (depending on the ventilator support) were hourly prospectively recorded in the medical records. At 36 weeks, SFR was calculated as the mean of the SFR values recorded during 24 h on the day that each infant reached 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. At least 12 SFR individual values in 24 h were used to calculate the SFR value. At birth, SFRs were calculated as mean values of the first 6 h of life or before surfactant administration if it occurred. Invasive modes of ventilatory support were synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), synchronized intermittent positive pressure ventilation (SIPPV), pressure support ventilation (PSV) and high-frequency ventilation (HFV), whereas non-invasive modes of ventilatory support were nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC).

Energy and proteins in human milk (colostrum, transitional and mature human milk) were calculated using the reference values reported by Anderson and colleagues [13]. In case of fortification, energy and proteins were adjusted according to the composition and amount of the added fortifier. Infant milk formula compositions were based on the product's nutritional label. The energy values of intravenous carbohydrates and lipids were 3.9 kcal/g and 9.0 kcal/g, respectively. Intravenous intakes were calculated using the composition of tailored PN bags prepared by the hospital pharmacy according to medical prescriptions.

Sample size was calculated based on available data regarding the incidence of BPD in AGA preterm infants at the Ancona NICU who were exclusively fed with infant formulas from birth until 36 weeks, which was 16%. According to our database, about 1600 preterm infants of less than 32 weeks were admitted to our unit during the study period. Assuming a patient drop-out of about 35% after checking for inclusion/exclusion criteria and a similar incidence of BPD between AGA infants exclusively fed with infant formulas and those fed with a provision of MOM < 66% of cumulative EN volumes per kg from birth to 36 weeks, we estimated a sample of 515 infants per group to detect a difference of at least 35% in BPD with an 80% power at a significance level of 0.05.

Depending on the distribution, data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, median (interquartile range, IQR) or percentage. Clinical data of the study groups were compared using the independent t-test, Mann-Whitney test, or Chi-square test as appropriate, and significance level was set at 0.05.

Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of MOM with BPD and Q1-SFR at 36 weeks. Pearson's correlation test and chi-square test was used to identify variables associated with BPD and Q1-SFR at 36 weeks at univariate analysis. Tested variables were GA (days), birth weight (g), sex (yes/no), year of admission before 2013 (yes/no), cesarean section (yes/no), receiving PN (yes/no), surfactant administration (yes/no), mean SFR at 6 h of life or before surfactant administration if it occurred (number), early-onset sepsis (yes/no), patent ductus arteriosus (yes/no), vitamin A supplementation (yes/no), late-onset sepsis with a positive blood culture (yes/no), necrotizing enterocolitis stage II or III (yes/no), retinopathy of prematurity (yes/no), need of invasive ventilatory supports > 7 days (yes/no), oxygen exposure > 7 days (yes/no), and daily PN + EN energy intakes (kcal/kg/d) from birth to 36 weeks. Variables were included in the regressions if frequency was >5% and p < 0.1 at univariate and considered significantly associated with the dependent variable if p < 0.05.

Back at the scene of the Euro 2020 final, Sancho appears in the mood for a very different ending since going back 'home'

A Champions League final at Wembley comes laced with meaning for many associated with Borussia Dortmund. Marco Reus and Mats Hummels played in their defeat there to Bayern Munich in 2013. Edin Terzic, now the manager, was in London as a fan.

The stadium holds slightly different emotions for another among the Dortmund squad tasked with providing a better ending against Real Madrid on Saturday. For Jadon Sancho, his Wembley final was more than disappointing. It was the night everything changed.

Brought on by Gareth Southgate in the 120th minute of England's European Championship final against Italy, Sancho had been introduced to take a penalty. His shot was saved, his team lost and he was the subject of horrendous racist abuse in the aftermath.

Just 12 days later, his £73m move to Manchester United was confirmed. He arrived as perhaps the most exciting young prospect in European football after scoring 50 goals and providing 64 assists in 137 games for Dortmund. He was still only 21 years old.

Events since have conspired to mean that despite earning the right to walk out at Wembley again in the biggest game in European club football, he does so having long since lost his place in the England squad - and not with United but back on loan at Dortmund.

The story of what happened in the intervening period depends on who you ask. For some, Sancho was a victim of the United malaise. Expected to turn up and turn it on, he found a team lacking in structure, an environment not conducive to allowing him to thrive.

Sancho had never been a soloist despite those slaloming runs from deep. At Dortmund, he had full-backs overlapping to create space and a centre-forward willing to exchange passes and provide movement. At United, it was just give him the ball and wait.

Others would point to talk of tardiness that predated his arrival, whispers of a questionable attitude. Omitted by Erik ten Hag on the grounds of training-ground performance, Sancho pushed back, refused to apologise and found himself frozen out of the squad.

It remains remarkable, something alluded to by former Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp as he left Liverpool. ""I cannot just buy into that 'he's useless' stuff - like other clubs did by the way,"" he said. ""Buying a player for £80m and then sending him out on loan!""

But whatever the situation says about United it did not reflect well on Sancho, either, and a response was required. Dortmund, it seems, was the best place from where to provide one. He immediately cut a different figure on his return to Germany. ""Dortmund is home to me,"" he declared.

The club where he had made his name seemed to intuitively understand their role in helping him to show his talent, rediscover his true self. ""Jadon is a player that needs to smile,"" noted Terzic. ""If he is smiling then he is going to shine on the pitch.""

Dortmund eased him back at first but they played him into form. It has not been a tour de force, with two goals and two assists in his 14 Bundesliga appearances, but there have been glimpses of the talent that once lit up their stadium. He has felt valued again.

'We forget they are human'

Speaking to Jurgen Klinsmann about this, he emphasised the human aspect. ""Jadon obviously had a rough time finding his rhythm again and settling back again. We often forget that these very talented young players are just human beings,"" he told Sky Sports.

""When they go from one extreme to another and do not find their form in one place and something is not working or clicking and then they decide to go back to the place they came before, it takes time to adjust and get their confidence and form back.

""In that situation, I think that it is really important that the manager is patient with the player, that the manager lets the player do their thing and is there to help but not putting them too much under pressure to perform right away at the highest level.""

Real Sancho emerging again

His importance to Dortmund is illustrated by the statistics. Sancho has completed 36 dribbles in the Bundesliga since his return - ranking third in the competition in that time - and has created more chances from open play than any other Dortmund player.

But it is in the Champions League that he has really impressed. It was in this competition, in a 2-0 win over PSV in March, that he scored his first goal back in front of those Dortmund supporters. Against Paris Saint-Germain, in the semi-final, he was outstanding.

His 13 completed dribbles in the first leg were not only the most by a player in a Champions League game this season, they were more than anyone else in the previous two seasons as well. In fact, only Eden Hazard and Neymar have topped that figure in the past decade.

Confidence restored, Sancho was running at defenders with purpose again, full of energy on and off the ball. Since returning, he has blocked more passes than anyone else in the Champions League and ranks second in the competition for recovering possession.

Klinsmann speaks for everyone when he says that it is a joy to see him like this. ""[He has shown] that he can perform at the highest level he has shown in the past in his young career. So I was really pleased that he picked up the pace now and is looking good, looking sharp.""

All that remains is a fitting ending. Three years on, he can close the loop with another big performance against Real Madrid, making history at the club that helped make him a star, at the stadium where the dream started to unravel.

Continental supremacy is at stake at Wembley Stadium on Saturday evening, when underdogs Borussia Dortmund and seasoned Champions League pros Real Madrid square off in a 2023-24 final of titanic proportions.

For the Bundesliga powerhouses donning black and yellow, victory would end 27 years of hurt and seal Champions League title number two, while Los Blancos endeavour to etch their name onto the European Champion Clubs' Cup for the 15th time.

Edin Terzic's men were triumphant against Paris Saint-Germain in the final four to book their tickets to Wembley, while Carlo Ancelotti's troops denied their upcoming foes an all-German final against Bayern Munich thanks to a gripping second-leg turnaround.

Exorcising former Champions League demons under the Wembley arch is the goal for Saturday's unfancied unit Borussia Dortmund, 11 years on from helplessly witnessing Arjen Robben's scuffed shot trickle over the line for Bayern Munich in a 2012-13 Der Klassiker final in the English capital.

Departing club icon Marco Reus and rejuvenated centre-back Mats Hummels may be the only surviving members from that silver medal-winning troupe - the latter's CV also includes an Allianz Arena stint sandwiched in between - but none of Terzic's first-time finalists will require a sermon on the significance of June 1.

Coming up trumps in the tantalising Group of Death with AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle United was a sign of things to come for Borussia Dortmund, who sent PSV Eindhoven packing without breaking too much of a sweat before a minor blip in the first leg of their quarter-final versus Atletico Madrid.

Suffering their sole defeat of the 2023-24 tournament at the Wanda Metropolitano did not hinder Dortmund's bid for European glory, though, as a phenomenal second-leg turnaround preceded a pair of exceptional 1-0 successes over perpetual bridesmaids PSG, shut out at both the Signal Iduna Park and Parc des Princes in early May.

Thanks to their own defensive discipline and the never-ending wastefulness of the Ligue 1 champions, BVB condemned PSG to another year of Champions League torture as the old-but-gold Hummels nodded in the solitary second-leg strike, thereby booking Dortmund a date with Champions League destiny for just the third time ever.

One-time European Cup champions back in the 1996-97 term, where Ottmar Hitzfeld masterminded a 3-1 triumph over Juventus in Munich, Dortmund have not been present in the showpiece event since falling to Bayern's supremacy in London over a decade ago, and Real's semi-final exploits means that a shot at Bavarian revenge did not materialise.

Even as Bayern lost their iron-clad grip on the Bundesliga title, Terzic's men and the rest of the division were powerless to quell the Bayer Leverkusen juggernaut, and despite demolishing SV Darmstadt 98 4-0 in their closing contest, Dortmund could only labour to a fifth-placed finish.

However, thanks to Germany's superior UEFA coefficient over all other nations barring Italy, BVB will dine at Europe's top table next year regardless of the result of Saturday's final, which they enter also seeking four straight Champions League victories at any stage for the first time in nearly 10 years.

Dortmund's overall trophy drought has not been as agonisingly long as their 27-year wait for Champions League title number two - they prevailed in the 2020-21 DFB-Pokal - but a Champions League winners' medal would shine much brighter around the neck of the Signal Iduna Park's favourite son Reus before he clears out his Dortmund locker.

As has been customary throughout his record-breaking Champions League career, though, there will be no room for sentiment for Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti, already in a class of his own with four European Cup triumphs as a head coach and now seeking to steer further clear of the chasing pack.

Of course, 14-time winners Real Madrid will be bidding farewell to a revered German servant of their own on Saturday, when midfield maestro Toni Kroos will play his final competitive club match before a Euro 2024 swansong, and the 34-year-old has already experienced one taste of Champions League final stardom over Dortmund from his Bayern heyday.

Kroos and his fellow fundamental Real performers did not drop a single point in the Champions League group stage versus Portuguese outfit Braga, deposed Italian champions Napoli and Bundesliga upstarts Union Berlin, although the manner of their 2-1 aggregate triumph over last-16 foes RB Leipzig left something to be desired.

However, in quintessential Blancos fashion, Ancelotti's men astonishingly found a way to prevail against defending champions Man City - exacting revenge on their 2022-23 semi-final conquerors from 12 yards - before Newcastle United fans up and down the land rubbed their eyes and pinched themselves in bewilderment.

After shaking hands on a 2-2 first-leg stalemate, a rocket from Alphonso Davies - potentially a future Blancos player - appeared to have extinguished Real's dreams of crown number 15, only for Espanyol loanee Joselu to write his name into Bernabeu folklore with a dazzling double to punch their ticket to Wembley.

Thanks to the astounding individual efforts of the erstwhile Magpie, Real Madrid's iconic logo will appear on the front cover of the Champions League final programme for the 18th time on Saturday, and only three of Los Blancos' previous 17 appearances in the trophy match have ended in heartbreak.

In fact, it has been a staggering 43 years since the Spanish behemoths came out second best in the showpiece, and since that crushing loss versus Liverpool in 1981, Real Madrid have triumphed in each of the last eight Champions League finals in which they have been present.

Extending that phenomenal sequence would seal a terrific treble of trophies for the reigning La Liga and Supercopa de Espana champions, who may have concluded the regular top-flight campaign by dropping four points against Villarreal and Real Betis, but little sleep should be lost over those two stalemates.

Unbeaten in 25 straight matches since January's Copa del Rey beating at the hands of Atletico, Ancelotti's men have also found the net in every single one of their fixtures away from their Bernabeu base in the 2023-24 season, another promising omen ahead of Saturday's European extravaganza.

A conqueror of Dortmund in the 2012-13 Champions League alongside the departing Kroos, stricken Real Madrid defender David Alaba is still confined to the infirmary owing to his ACL injury, which has also dashed his Euro 2024 dreams.

The Austria international is one of two Blancos players set to watch on helplessly this weekend, as Aurelien Tchouameni has failed to recover from his foot problem in time, meaning that Nacho Fernandez should sport the captain's armband for one final time before his expected exit too.

The remainder of Ancelotti's outfield soldiers are in good nick - including former Dortmund starboy Jude Bellingham - but goalkeeper Andriy Lunin has come down with an extremely untimely bout of flu, forcing him to isolate from the remainder of the squad.

Out of fear of the bug being passed on, Lunin is reportedly set to travel to London separately - assuming his affliction clears up in time for the weekend - although his illness does make Ancelotti's decision to start the fully-fit Thibaut Courtois that little bit easier.

Donning the famous white strip for the final time, Kroos is expected to line up alongside Eduardo Camavinga and Federico Valverde in a Luka Modric-less midfield trident, but Joselu's semi-final heroics should not be enough to break up the Brazilian partnership of Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior up front.

Likewise, the Dortmund doctors are also nursing a couple of stars back to full health, including Ramy Bensebaini (knee), Julien Duranville (muscle) and Mateu Morey (illness), although the latter was not included in BVB's Champions League knockout squad anyway.

The only question mark in the Germans' ranks is striker Sebastien Haller, who has returned to team training following an ankle problem, but the ex-West Ham United man is certain to play second fiddle to Niclas Fullkrug, scorer of Dortmund's first of two strikes versus PSG across their semi-final showdowns.

Ten of the 11 starters from the second-leg success over Les Parisiens also began the final-day Bundesliga beating of Darmstadt, the one exception being Reus, who unsurprisingly got the nod over Julian Brandt in the latter fixture and - of course - capped off his closing Bundesliga appearance for BVB with a goal.

As tempted as Terzic may be to persist with Reus, certainly the fans' favourite to finally add a Champions League honour to his resume, the Dortmund boss cannot bow to nostalgia and should re-introduce Brandt into an otherwise settled XI.

Potentially playing his final game for the club as speculation over his long-term future rages, Manchester United loanee Jadon Sancho - who memorably completed a sensational 12 dribbles versus PSG in the semi-final first leg - seeks to haunt Ferland Mendy's nightmares on the right wing, and in Reus's likely absence from the first XI, 2012-13 winner Emre Can sports the skipper's armband.

Borussia Dortmund possible starting lineup:

Kobel; Ryerson, Hummels, Schlotterbeck, Maatsen; Sabitzer, Can; Sancho, Brandt, Adeyemi; Fullkrug

Real Madrid possible starting lineup:

Courtois; Carvajal, Rudiger, Nacho, Mendy; Valverde, Camavinga, Kroos; Bellingham; Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior

Head to head

Frequent foes in Champions League campaigns gone by, Dortmund and Real Madrid have already crossed paths on 14 occasions in Europe's premier competition, and Los Blancos unsurprisingly lead the head-to-head tally with six triumphs compared to BVB's trio of wins.

The most recent of Real's successes arrived in a pair of group meetings in the 2017-18 season, while Dortmund have not come up trumps since a 2-0 quarter-final second-leg success in 2013-14, and even that was inconsequential owing to Los Blancos' 3-0 first-leg beating.

However, the stakes have never been higher between Saturday's Wembley hopefuls, who have met in two semi-finals in 1997-98 (won by Real) and 2012-13 (won by Dortmund) but have never butted heads with the trophy ready and waiting for the victor.

We say: Borussia Dortmund 0-1 Real Madrid

By conquering the group of death, completing a remarkable turnaround versus Atletico and keeping PSG at bay over two legs, not a soul can question Dortmund's place in the showpiece event, but Terzic and co will be under no illusions that they were fortunate to benefit from Parisien profligacy in the semis.

Real's path to Wembley has not been smooth-sailing by any means either, but whether it is the Blancos players thriving under the weight of expectation, the rousing chants of their fans or just the power of the Ancelotti eyebrow, the 14-time champions just get it done.

On Saturday, we expect no different. Last year's final between Man City and Inter Milan was settled by a solitary goal, and Champions League lightning could strike twice in London, as Real Madrid reclaim their status as Europe's top dogs.

The 6 players Man Utd signed alongside Anthony Martial in 2015,"Anthony Martial has left Manchester United after nine years at the club - but how did the other six arrivals in the summer of 2015 fare at Old Trafford?

Martial scored 90 goals in 317 appearances for United, but will largely be remembered as a frustrating figure by the Old Trafford faithful after failing to fully deliver on his early promise.

We've taken a look back at the other players signed by Louis van Gaal that summer to see where they are in the present day.

Depay played under Van Gaal with the Netherlands and was tipped to be the next big thing after joining United from PSV in 2015.

But the attacker failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford, scoring just two Premier League goals before completing a £16million move to Lyon in January 2017.

Happily, Depay enjoyed a career renaissance in France and helped Lyon reach the Champions League semis in 2020 - earning himself a move to Barcelona in the process.

While his time at Camp Nou was undistinguished, Depay enjoyed a happier spell with Atletico Madrid despite injuries limiting his impact to 13 goals in 40 appearances.

The Netherlands international is set to leave Atletico at the end of his contract this summer - and will be aiming to impress potential suitors at this summer's European Championship.

Darmian only ever had a bit-part role during his four years at Old Trafford and returned to his native Italy in 2019, joining Parma in a £1.4million deal.

The full-back has since joined Inter Milan and has managed to get his hands on seven trophies back in Italy. Darmian also went close to winning the Champions League in 2023, only for Inter to lose the final against Manchester City.

TRY A QUIZ: Can you name every Man Utd manager of the post-war era?

Having impressed in the Premier League with Southampton, Schneiderlin joined United in the summer of 2015 but failed to recapture the form he had shown on the south coast.

After Van Gaal was sacked, the midfielder played just 11 league minutes under Jose Mourinho and went on to rejoin former manager Ronald Koeman at Everton in January 2017.

After a bright start, things didn't go as planned there either and the midfielder then had spells in France and Turkey before joining Greek side Kifisia in 2023.

Having worked under Van Gaal at Bayern Munich, Schweinsteiger joined United in 2015 but made just 35 appearances for the club in all competitions.

He was marginalised by Jose Mourinho, but was also the subject of a rare Special One apology that presumably sits alongside the World Cup winners medal in Schweinsteiger's trophy cabinet.

""He apologised to me later,"" he told FourFourTwo. ""I gave him a handshake and said, 'All good, don't worry'.

Man Utd were truly blessed in the goalkeeper department when they had Romero and a prime David de Gea in their ranks.

The former Argentina international made 61 matches in all competitions for United, keeping 39 clean sheets before signing for Serie A fashion icons Venezia in October 2021.

He went on to make 16 appearances, keeping three clean sheets, but he couldn't stop them from getting relegated. The now 37-year-old joined Boca Juniors in 2022 and hasn't looked back since.

Since heading back to Argentina, Romero has made 69 appearances in total. It's nice to see a perennial back-up goalkeeper get his flowers late in his career.

Poole joined from Newport County for a fee of around £100,000 in September 2015.

The Welsh defender spent the majority of his time at United out on loan, but did make a cameo in the Europa League against Midtjylland in 2016.

After being released by the club in 2019, he signed for League One side Milton Keynes Dons on a free transfer.

""I made my debut for the Manchester United first team and that's something to be really proud of and that will stay with me forever,"" Poole told the Manchester Evening News in 2019. ""I loved my time at the club, it was amazing.""

New head coach Arne Slot has now been tasked with continuing the club's evolution when he officially takes his position as Liverpool head coach on Saturday.

With Fenway Sports Group chief executive of football Michael Edwards and Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes also beginning their new roles at the weekend, the Anfield recruitment drive can begin in earnest.

And here ECHO writers and others take a look at what should be the first business for Slot.

Ian Doyle

Without wishing to hark back to the days when almost every major new signing was wrongly regarded as the last piece of the jigsaw that would turn Liverpool into serious title contenders, there's no doubt the Reds would have been a bit nearer the Premier League summit had there been one more player in the squad.

And that's why Slot must make a new defensive midfielder a priority regardless of where else the incoming boss believes his squad should be strengthened.

The sweeping of the board in the corridors of power at Anfield have left a vacuum that will be filled by relentless transfer tittle tattle. Look around and it's easy to see this has already started, and perhaps will only increase when agents spot and easy route to bolstering the value of their client. After all, who wouldn't want to be linked with Liverpool?

Throw in a couple of major international tournaments and the rumour mill will be in overdrive in the not-so-distant future. The Reds recruitment team, though, will have their shortlists - and with Edwards back as a transfer influence, don't be surprised if some of those names are not quite what many anticipated.

Theo Squires

I can see Liverpool strengthening in four positions this summer. Attack (preferably a natural alternative to Mohamed Salah on the right), defensive midfield, centre-back, and in goal. But which will Slot consider the priority? If I was the one making the decision, my first focus would be a new defensive midfielder.

Wataru Endo exceeded expectations following his £16.25million move from VfB Stuttgart, having only been brought in after the Reds missed out on the likes of Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia. But the Japanese is not a long-term solution. And as highly-rated as Stefan Bajcetic is, he is still only 19 and has missed over a year through injury. He needs to be managed carefully.

You only need to look at Arsenal last season to see the impact a world-class enforcer can have on a team following Declan Rice's arrival. Liverpool now need to recruit the same, having missed out on such a player in both of the last two summers.

They have been linked with Atalanta's Ederson, with reports in Italy going as far as to suggest the Reds have been left 'bewitched' by the Brazilian.

Admittedly, the arrival of a new head coach, sporting director and plethora of other changes behind the scenes at Anfield was always going to prompt even more summer transfer speculation than usual. But if Ederson is really on the radar, he could fit the bill.

If not, the ECHO reported at the start of the year that Genoa's Morten Frendrup was being monitored by the club. Time will tell if early interest is followed up in the summer.

Tom Coley

It's set to be a summer of change for Liverpool. Getting things right will be crucial to helping Slot transition into the hotseat as well as appeasing fans who are concerned at just how the new man might go about trying to emulate his predecessor.

When it comes to the squad, Liverpool's attack needs some work. It feels slightly wild to say that given they have strong options across the board, but the consistency has just not been there.

Diogo Jota is a great asset when he's fit but hasn't been able to have the impact needed over the course of a season, and then there is the Salah debate. With his possible departure it would be smart to both plan for the future without him as well as reinforce.

A left-footed right winger who can create something out of nothing? That's Michael Olise. Every team in the world should be after him, especially if the reported £60million fee is true. Get Olise done early and let the rest of the squad form around him. Maybe Eberechi Eze as an attacking midfield option as well to go all in on the Crystal Palace boys. That creates problems with Dominik Szoboszlai and Harvey Elliott, but it sure would be a nice issue to have.

Stephen Killen

Liverpool have to be smart and shrewd. Do they buy a new back-up goalkeeper? Should they buy a central defender despite Jarell Quansah's emergence? Will the midfield department be targeted again? There are big decisions to be made to ensure the hard work of Klopp is continued.

Virgil van Dijk, Trent-Alexander Arnold and Salah are all entering the final 12 months of their contracts. By the end of the 2024/25 season, Van Dijk and Salah will be approaching 34 and 33 respectively. In recent months, Johan Bakayoko has emerged as a potential target and Slot will know him well having come up against his PSV Eindhoven.

The end of Salah's career at Anfield is approaching and with the curtain coming down on his spell with the Reds it will be the passing of the baton over to the next Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Salah partnership.

Who better to show you what it means to be a success than one of the best attackers in the club's history? Not only would Bakayoko rubbing shoulders with Salah be beneficial, being his understudy for a year will ease pressure too and avoid the inevitable comparisons and question of, 'is he a suitable replacement for Salah?'.

Liverpool have to continue future-proofing and before the Reds are left hamstrung by the need to replace the Egyptian, they need to be proactive. Bakayoko should be Slot's first signing.

Amie Wilson

The summer departure of Thiago Alcantara at the end of his contract in the summer may mean that Liverpool will have to reinforce the midfield.

Ederson has impressed with Atalanta this season, scoring six goals in 35 Serie A appearances. He also played in both of Atalanta's Europa League matches against Liverpool, meaning the Reds had a chance to see what he can do up close.

Any rebuild under Arne Slot is likely to be concentrated on younger players who can improve. At 24 years old, Ederson is at the ideal age where he has not yet reached his peak but will still have experience to bring to the team.

His versatility of being able to play in any midfield position will also come as a huge bonus to Liverpool. On several occasions, he was deployed in a more defensive midfield role for Atlanta, while his more natural position is further forward in central midfield.

Keifer MacDonald

For a summer that will see Liverpool enter the unknown, one thing that is for certain is that it promises to be a busy off-season at Anfield.

Rectifying some of the issues from the old regime will also be high on Hughes's inventory list, with Liverpool still yet to sign a like-for-like replacement for the long-serving Fabinho, who left Anfield nearly 12 months ago.

The public, big-money pursuit of Moises Caicedo last summer highlighted the problem that the Reds, and other Premier League clubs for that matter, are facing: there is a shortage of ready-made, elite-level defensive midfielders in the market.

But even if it is only names like Manu Kone, Khephren Thuram and Boubacar Kamara that are being linked with moves to Anfield, the Reds must move swiftly to ensure they are constructing a spine capable of challenging for a title next season; and that must start with addressing the most important position on the pitch.

No names specifically, but a defensive midfielder must be the Reds' first addition of the summer.

Isaac Johnson

I think Slot's first transfer job is to decide what his centre-back plans are. Joel Matip has left but Quansah has emerged as a promising Academy graduate earning his stripes.

Ibrahima Konate is still only 25 while Joe Gomez will still want ample game time. Of course, Van Dijk is approaching the final year of his contract. The Dutchman turns 33 over the summer and Liverpool must plan for the future.

Leny Yoro has been linked with Anfield but at 18 he is still very raw and 21-year-old Quansah already fills the young defender criteria. Someone slightly more experienced but still mouldable would be ideal, such as Crystal Palace's 23-year-old Marc Guehi.

Of course, the likes of Gomez and Konate would be challenging him for game time and that's something to consider. Perhaps one may need to be sold, which seems brutal but the type of move Slot needs to make if the Reds are to challenge for the title.

That said, if Caoimhin Kelleher leaves early then Slot's first signing should be a replacement goalkeeper. It's a less sexy area of the pitch but a vital one. Then next should come a defensive midfield arrival.",liverpoolecho.co.uk,news,Liverpool Echo,,0.1215686274509804,454651539,1,https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29253932.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154356408.jpg,eng-9601354

This year's edition will see two teams with deep histories square off, with one, in particular, known for its magic in the competition.

La Liga's Real Madrid, which boasts the most titles in the tournament, will face off against Bundesliga's Borussia Dortmund, which won one in the '90s.

Madrid is coming off a stellar season in Spain where it lost just once en route to winning the league, while Dortmund fell to fifth after nearly winning the German league last season.

Here's everything to know about the 2024 Champions League Final:

La Liga's Real Madrid and Bundesliga's Borussia Dortmund are the two teams in this year's final.

The final is set for Saturday, June 1 at 3 p.m. ET/12 p.m. PT.

Wembley Stadium in London is the host venue for the final.

The final will be broadcast on CBS and streamed live on Paramount+.

Real Madrid has won the most Champions Leagues with 14. The next highest total is seven (Italy's AC Milan).

Dortmund, for comparison's sake, has one, which came in 1996-97. Madrid's most recent triumph came in 2021-22.

In terms of coaches, Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti is the manager with the most triumphs in the competition. He won two with Milan in 2003 and 2007 before winning two with Madrid in 2014 and 2022.

Three managers have won the tournament three times, including Pep Guardiola, so Ancelotti has an opportunity to add another for extra breathing room.

Madrid finished atop Group C, which included Napoli, Braga and Union Berlin. The club then eliminated RB Leipzig, Manchester City and Bayern Munich en route to reaching the final stage.

Dortmund claimed first in Group F, which was this year's ""Group of Death."" Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Newcastle United were the other three clubs. Der BVB then eliminated PSV, Atletico Madrid and PSG, again, to make the final.

Ancelotti typically runs various 4-3-3 formations, but it's more free flowing than possession based. The quality of the players makes the system work, not the other way around. Edin Terzic, Dortmund's manager, runs a 4-2-3-1 with two defensive midfielders, hybrid fullbacks and non-inverted wingers.

These six players could be decisive:

AM Jude Bellingham, Real Madrid: Bellingham, who came to Madrid last season from Dortmund in a deal worth around a reported 100 million euros, is not your typical midfielder. He operates in more advanced areas rather than dictating play and picks his spots in the box wisely. With 19 goals and six assists in 28 league games, the 20-year-old has an opportunity for a storybook game.

CB Mats Hummels, Dortmund: Hummels, 35, is one of the best ball-playing center-backs you'll see. On top of that, he's often been reliable as a box defender and hasn't let his loss of pace and athleticism deter him from being one of the best in his position. If anyone can keep Madrid's forwards in check, Hummels, on his day, is a solid pick.

LW Vinicius Jr., Real Madrid: Like Bellingham, Vinicius Jr. is a potential Ballon d'Or candidate. The 23-year-old Brazilian has risen to the occasion in several games this year and has five goals and four assists in nine UCL games. If Julian Ryerson is Dortmund's starting right-back, he'll need to have the game of his life.

GK Gregor Kobel, Dortmund: Defense wins titles, and Dortmund will need its players to shine to have a chance. Along with Hummels, Kobel, 26, will need to exhibit why he's one of the sport's rising young keepers. The Swiss international isn't a great ball player but is an excellent shot stopper, which can be more important in these scenarios. (Madrid also has a goalie situation to watch between Thibaut Courtois and Andriy Lunin.)

CM Toni Kroos, Madrid: Kroos won his first ever Champions League at Wembley and he can end his career by doing the same. The 34-year-old German midfielder, one of the best to do it, is set to play his last game for Madrid before retiring at the conclusion of the Euros in the summer. With Aurelien Tchouameni out, Kroos will be vital in dictating play against a team he's familiar with.

CAM Marco Reus, Dortmund: Someone will need to score for Dortmund at some point. BVB doesn't have the same world-class talent up top like Madrid, but Reus, 34, is a club legend who could also write his name in the history books with a UCL title.

The final club game of 2024 is the biggest of them all -- the UEFA Champions League Final.

This year's edition will see two teams with deep histories square off, with one, in particular, known for its magic in the competition.

La Liga's Real Madrid, which boasts the most titles in the tournament, will face off against Bundesliga's Borussia Dortmund, which won one in the '90s.

Madrid is coming off a stellar season in Spain where it lost just once en route to winning the league, while Dortmund fell to fifth after nearly winning the German league last season.

Here's everything to know about the 2024 Champions League Final:

La Liga's Real Madrid and Bundesliga's Borussia Dortmund are the two teams in this year's final.

The final is set for Saturday, June 1 at 3 p.m. ET/12 p.m. PT.

Wembley Stadium in London is the host venue for the final.

The final will be broadcast on CBS and streamed live on Paramount+.

Real Madrid has won the most Champions Leagues with 14. The next highest total is seven (Italy's AC Milan).

Dortmund, for comparison's sake, has one, which came in 1996-97. Madrid's most recent triumph came in 2021-22.

In terms of coaches, Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti is the manager with the most triumphs in the competition. He won two with Milan in 2003 and 2007 before winning two with Madrid in 2014 and 2022.

Three managers have won the tournament three times, including Pep Guardiola, so Ancelotti has an opportunity to add another for extra breathing room.

Madrid finished atop Group C, which included Napoli, Braga and Union Berlin. The club then eliminated RB Leipzig, Manchester City and Bayern Munich en route to reaching the final stage.

Dortmund claimed first in Group F, which was this year's ""Group of Death."" Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Newcastle United were the other three clubs. Der BVB then eliminated PSV, Atletico Madrid and PSG, again, to make the final.

Ancelotti typically runs various 4-3-3 formations, but it's more free flowing than possession based. The quality of the players makes the system work, not the other way around. Edin Terzic, Dortmund's manager, runs a 4-2-3-1 with two defensive midfielders, hybrid fullbacks and non-inverted wingers.

These six players could be decisive:

AM Jude Bellingham, Real Madrid: Bellingham, who came to Madrid last season from Dortmund in a deal worth around a reported 100 million euros, is not your typical midfielder. He operates in more advanced areas rather than dictating play and picks his spots in the box wisely. With 19 goals and six assists in 28 league games, the 20-year-old has an opportunity for a storybook game.

CB Mats Hummels, Dortmund: Hummels, 35, is one of the best ball-playing center-backs you'll see. On top of that, he's often been reliable as a box defender and hasn't let his loss of pace and athleticism deter him from being one of the best in his position. If anyone can keep Madrid's forwards in check, Hummels, on his day, is a solid pick.

LW Vinicius Jr., Real Madrid: Like Bellingham, Vinicius Jr. is a potential Ballon d'Or candidate.

Madrid finished atop Group C, which included Napoli, Braga and Union Berlin. The club then eliminated RB Leipzig, Manchester City and Bayern Munich en route to reaching the final stage.

Dortmund claimed first in Group F, which was this year's ""Group of Death."" Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Newcastle United were the other three clubs. Der BVB then eliminated PSV, Atletico Madrid and PSG, again, to make the final.

Ancelotti typically runs various 4-3-3 formations, but it's more free flowing than possession based. The quality of the players makes the system work, not the other way around. Edin Terzic, Dortmund's manager, runs a 4-2-3-1 with two defensive midfielders, hybrid fullbacks and non-inverted wingers.

These six players could be decisive:

AM Jude Bellingham, Real Madrid: Bellingham, who came to Madrid last season from Dortmund in a deal worth around a reported 100 million euros, is not your typical midfielder. He operates in more advanced areas rather than dictating play and picks his spots in the box wisely. With 19 goals and six assists in 28 league games, the 20-year-old has an opportunity for a storybook game.

CB Mats Hummels, Dortmund: Hummels, 35, is one of the best ball-playing center-backs you'll see. On top of that, he's often been reliable as a box defender and hasn't let his loss of pace and athleticism deter him from being one of the best in his position. If anyone can keep Madrid's forwards in check, Hummels, on his day, is a solid pick.

LW Vinicius Jr., Real Madrid: Like Bellingham, Vinicius Jr. is a potential Ballon d'Or candidate. The 23-year-old Brazilian has risen to the occasion in several games this year and has five goals and four assists in nine UCL games. If Julian Ryerson is Dortmund's starting right-back, he'll need to have the game of his life.

GK Gregor Kobel, Dortmund: Defense wins titles, and Dortmund will need its players to shine to have a chance. Along with Hummels, Kobel, 26, will need to exhibit why he's one of the sport's rising young keepers. The Swiss international isn't a great ball player but is an excellent shot stopper, which can be more important in these scenarios. (Madrid also has a goalie situation to watch between Thibaut Courtois and Andriy Lunin.)

CM Toni Kroos, Madrid: Kroos won his first ever Champions League at Wembley and he can end his career by doing the same. The 34-year-old German midfielder, one of the best to do it, is set to play his last game for Madrid before retiring at the conclusion of the Euros in the summer. With Aurelien Tchouameni out, Kroos will be vital in dictating play against a team he's familiar with.

CAM Marco Reus, Dortmund: Someone will need to score for Dortmund at some point. BVB doesn't have the same world-class talent up top like Madrid, but Reus, 34, is a club legend who could also write his name in the history books with a UCL title.

He's also the author of ""Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.""

Remember the 2023-24 soccer season, when Bayer Leverkusen went undefeated in the Bundesliga, Manchester City won their fourth Premier League trophy in a row, Harry Kane scored approximately 300 goals and still didn't win a trophy and Borussia Dortmund made the Champions League final despite finishing fifth in their domestic league?

Me neither. Memorial Day is over, and that means the time has arrived for a summer of international soccer. For the U.S. men's national team, in particular, it means it's time for their last few truly competitive matches before they co-host the 2026 World Cup. Yes, they'll still have the Nations League, but they've already won it multiple times and the pressure in those matches can't equate to what they'd normally face in World Cup qualifying, or what they will face in June when the Copa America starts.

So, ahead of a summer that will also include the Olympics, we're taking stock of the depth of the American soccer program as a whole. We're going to sketch out the 15-deep depth charts for the eight major position groups: goalkeeper, right-back, left-back, center-back, defensive midfield, center midfield, winger and center forward.

The purpose of the exercise isn't necessarily to identify who exactly is the 14th-best American left-back, but to see what the USMNT's positions of strength and weakness are.

The USMNT's latest roster -- the last before the Copa America squad is announced -- is the guideline for the top players of each position. Beyond that, the methodology is a combination of past call-ups, comments from USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter and current form to sketch out the rest of each position group. As such, consider the top of each group to be a much more confident projection, while at some positions there might be very little to separate, say, the ninth player and the 25th player.

OK, we've got a list of 120 Americans to get through, so let's sort the top 15 players in every position on the USMNT depth chart.

This used to be a position of strength for the USMNT, and now it's probably the weakest spot in the entire player pool. But I'm not sure that's as bad as it seems.

Obviously, a team at the USMNT's level -- somewhere in the 15th-30th best-in-the-world range -- specifically benefits from having a great goalkeeper. These teams are not going to dominate their way to trophies. If one of these sides is to make a deep run in a major tournament -- like Morocco at the previous World Cup -- they are going to need to win a couple matches in which the opposition creates the majority of the chances. In those matches, you need your 'keeper to come up big.

In the past, the USMNT had multiple 'keepers who could come up big. Kasey Keller and Brad Friedel, both very good in Europe, were on the roster at the 2002 World Cup. In 2006, Keller, Tim Howard and Marcus Hahnemann were there -- all playing over in Europe. In 2010, it was Howard, Hahnemann and Aston Villa's Brad Guzan. And in 2014, Howard and Guzan were there again.

Now, the starter, Turner, hasn't played a Premier League match since January, while the backup, Ethan Horvath, had to go to the Championship midseason in order to find game time. Perhaps more worrying is that they were both quite poor when they played this season.

Horvath, per the site FBref, allowed 4.1 goals more than expected in his half-season with Cardiff, while Turner conceded 5.9 more than expected across his starts for Nottingham Forest. Orange are goals, purple are shots and the larger the circle, the greater the post-shot expected-goal value of the attempt:

Of course, the downside of having multiple great goalkeepers is that one of them will never play. Two great midfielders can both get on the field, two great center forwards can sub in and out with each other. And so if you had to pick one area on the field to not have any real depth, goalkeeper would be the choice. Plus, Turner was totally fine at the World Cup despite not playing a single league match for Arsenal during the 2022-23 season.

This position doesn't feel as strong as it did a couple seasons ago when Turner was breaking statistical models for goalkeeper performance in MLS, but I'm not sure it's because he's gotten worse. Rather, the past two seasons have provided more information about what his actual level is: probably somewhere between elite MLS 'keeper and starter in a ""Big Five"" top European league.

1. Sergiño Dest, FC Barcelona

2. Joe Scally, Borussia Monchengladbach

3. Bryan Reynolds, KVC Westerlo

4. Shaq Moore, Nashville FC

5. DeAndre Yedlin, FC Cincinnati

6. Nathan Harriel, Philadelphia Union

7. Reggie Cannon, Queens Park Rangers

8. Marlon Fossey, Standard Liege

9. Brooks Lennon, Atlanta United

10. Nick Lima, New England Revolution

11. Kyle Duncan, New York Red Bulls

12. Henry Wingo, Ferencvaros

13. Dylan Nealis, New York Red Bulls

14. Keegan Rosenberry, Colorado Rapids

15. Justin Che, ADO Den Haag

I'm sure some people who saw Moore struggle in limited minutes in Qatar were filled with dread when they saw his name on the USMNT's latest roster, the one from which Berhalter is presumably using to select his Copa America squad. But Moore seems to be a ""break-in-case-of-emergency"" option.

Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tim Weah are all capable of playing that position, and it seems like Reynolds might've earned the spot had there not been an Olympics this summer as well. An uninjured Yedlin might've gotten the nod over Moore, too. But the pattern with these position rankings is similar to the pattern at almost every other position: a couple starters for top-50 teams in the world, then a bunch of guys either playing in MLS or somewhere like Belgium or the Netherlands.

Dest will miss the Copa America after tearing his ACL, but such is the state of the player pool that Berhalter will likely plug in Scally, a 21-year-old who's been starting in the Bundesliga for three seasons now. Such is the state of the player pool, too, that there is a significant drop off in quality between Dest and Scally.

Dest is one of the team's ball-progression engines whenever he plays: driving the ball upfield with his feet or combining with the same-side midfielder and right winger. Dest's tight-space skill and creativity are unmatched in the player pool. Scally, meanwhile, is more of that modern full-back hybrid, somewhere between a center-back and full-back, rather than a pedal-to-the-medal attacker like Dest typically is.

How will that manifest itself this summer? The U.S. might be a little more solid defensively, but they also might struggle at times to work the ball into the attacking third.

1. Chris Richards, Crystal Palace

2. Tim Ream, Fulham

3. Miles Robinson, FC Cincinnati

4. Cameron Carter-Vickers, Celtic

5. Mark McKenzie, Genk

6. Walker Zimmerman, Nashville FC

7. Auston Trusty, Sheffield United

8. Maximilian Dietz, Greuther Furth

9. Jackson Ragen, Seattle Sounders

10. James Sands, NYCFC

11. Aaron Long, Los Angeles FC

12. John Brooks, Hoffenheim

13. Jonathan Tomkinson, Bradford City

14. Justen Glad, Real Salt Lake

15. Sean Nealis, New York Red Bulls

It's funny how quickly things can change. Richards didn't make the World Cup roster, and now he's the team's first-choice center-back.

His development this past season shows, well, how development tends to work. It's actually quite rare for a player to get touted as a top prospect and then just immediately play a ton of minutes from his teens through his 30s. This is what makes Pulisic and McKennie special -- both currently and in the history of the USMNT.

Instead, most players break out, stagnate or regress slightly and then establish themselves as trusted starters. Richards was a top prospect at Bayern Munich. He had two successful loan spells at Hoffenheim, and he even started a match for Bayern in the 2020-21 season at age 20. Given his early success at a position where players peak much later, it wasn't impossible to envision a world where he integrated into the Bayern first team eventually.

Instead, he transferred to Crystal Palace, missed a chunk of the 2022-23 season through injury and missed out on Qatar in the process. Did he ruin his career by moving to England? Not quite.

This season, Richards frequently played as midfielder under Roy Hodgson at Palace before getting pushed into the backline once Oliver Glasner took over and the club immediately went on its late-season tear. At 24, Richards now looks like a viable starter for a mid-tier team in the most competitive soccer league on the planet.

The question for this summer, then, is who starts next to Richards? Given the lineup in the Nations League final, it's likely Ream, but the 36-year-old has started just one game for Fulham since February. There is some depth behind Ream, though.

Robinson was a key starter for the USMNT in World Cup qualifying and he might be playing in Europe already had he not torn his Achilles. McKenzie starts for a Europa League team. Carter-Vickers does the same for Celtic, a Champions League team.

1. Antonee Robinson, Fulham

2. Kristoffer Lund, Palermo

3. John Tolkin, New York Red Bulls

4. Caleb Wiley, Atlanta United

5. George Bello, LASK

6. DeJuan Jones, New England Revolution

7. Jonathan Gomez, Real Sociedad

8. Marco Farfan, FC Dallas

9. Sam Vines, Colorado Rapids

10. Ryan Hollingshead, LAFC

11. Lynden Gooch, Stoke City

12. Andrew Brody, Real Salt Lake

13. Daniel Lovitz, Nashville FC

14. Kevin O'Toole, NYCFC

15. Andrew Gutman, Chicago Fire

While he's not the best outfield player for the USMNT, Robinson might be the hardest to replace.

Counting stats don't paint the whole picture of defensive impact, but there's at least some signal when you're at the top of the leaderboard. The USMNT's starting left-back led the Premier League in interceptions this past season and ranked seventh in tackles:

Much like he is with the U.S., he was also a vital outlet for Fulham in leading the team in progressive passes received. Robinson is just a really good player -- and as of now, he's the only left-footed American full-back you can confidently say that about.

Lund is still unproven with the USMNT and in a major European league. He hasn't necessarily been lighting up Serie B or anything like that. After him, in the pool, there are a handful of youngsters -- one of whom seems likely to pop, whether it's Tolkin or Wiley, who have played a ton of minutes at a young age in MLS, or Bello, who starts for one of the best teams in Austria, or Gomez, who has plenty of youth national team experience and played nearly 3,000 minutes on loan in Spain's second division this season.

There's a lot of projection there still, and then not much else beyond them.

1. Tyler Adams, Bournemouth

2. Johnny Cardoso, Real Betis

3. Lennard Maloney, Heidenheim

4. Aidan Morris, Columbus Crew

5. Tanner Tessmann, Venezia

6. Kellyn Acosta, Chicago Fire

7. Joshua Atencio, Seattle Sounders

8. Cole Bassett, Colorado Rapids

9. Jackson Yueill, San Jose Earthquakes

10. Keaton Parks, NYCFC

11. Frankie Amaya, New York Red Bulls

12. Obed Vargas, Seattle Sounders

13. Daniel Edelman, New York Red Bulls

14. Dante Polvara, Aberdeen

15. Wil Trapp, Minnesota United

Everything I just said about Robinson used to be true about Adams.

It seemed, in part, like much of the USMNT's success at the 2022 World Cup came down to the team lucking into the healthiest season of Adams' professional career. No one else on the team had his defensive range, and then he also combined it with solid ball-progressing passing. Adams allowed Berhalter to play two more freelancing midfielders ahead of him in Musah and McKennie and two very aggressive full-backs in Dest and Robinson outside of him.

Without Adams, it seemed like it might all fall apart. And then -- the USMNT annihilated Mexico and Canada at the Nations League last summer without Adams. And Cardoso became a full-time starter for the seventh-place team in LaLiga this season.

While a healthy Adams raises the team's ceiling, it's a massive boon for the team to not be so reliant on a player who is always injured. They were fine with Musah playing as the deepest midfielder a year ago, and Cardoso came in for Adams at halftime of the Nations League final against Mexico a few months ago.

Beyond them, Maloney starts in the Bundesliga, but offers very little on the ball. Both Morris and Tessmann seem likely to develop into consistent USMNT call-ups soon, and then there are a ton of young central midfielders, who could be classified in either midfield category, getting consistent playing time in MLS.

1. Weston McKennie, Juventus

2. Giovanni Reyna, Borussia Dortmund

3. Yunus Musah, AC Milan

4. Malik Tillman, Bayern Munich

5. Luca de la Torre, Celta Vigo

6. Timmy Tillman, LAFC

7. Jack McGlynn, Philadelphia Union

8. Paxten Aaronson, Eintracht Frankfurt

9. Cristian Roldan, Seattle Sounders

10. Gianluca Busio, Venezia

11. Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake

12. Benjamin Cremaschi, Inter Miami

13. Rokas Pukstas, Hajduk Split

14. Julian Green, Greuter Furth

15. Djordje Mihailovic, Colorado Rapids

Just read the names of those first four clubs back to yourself. Things are very good in the advanced midfield role. McKennie is one of the most important players on Juventus. Reyna was great in the Nations League despite barely playing at all at the club level this season. Musah had a decent first season for the second-best team in Italy. And Tillman put up ridiculous numbers while on loan at PSV Eindhoven this past season.

Three of those guys are 21, and McKennie is 25. After that group, there's a good deal of potential, too.

De la Torre started 22 games in LaLiga this season. The elder Tillman, Timmy, got one of the final roster spots at the Copa America. McGlynn has been getting significant minutes in MLS since he was 17. Aaronson found some playing time in the Netherlands after a second half of season loan from Frankfurt. At 21, Busio is on his third season of starter minutes in Italy, and his performance has improved in each one. Luna is one of the more promising creative prospects to come out of MLS in a while. Cremaschi, 19, already earned a senior-team call-up and Pukstas started 28 games and scored eight goals for the third-best team in Croatia.

The scoring and creating winger is probably still the most important position in the current iteration of the professional game. Thankfully, the USMNT's best player plays there, and he's coming off the best season of his professional career.

In his first season in Serie A, Pulisic set career highs in minutes (2,602), goals (12) and assists (8). His underlying numbers weren't quite as hot -- 8.0 xG and 4.8 expected assists -- but the most important thing for him this season was reestablishing himself as a legit starter on a Champions league team.

After Pulisic, though, it's not great! Unlike the full-back positions, wingers tend to be more interchangeable on the left and right side, but there's still a concerning lack of quality depth.

Weah spent most of the season at Juventus as a backup wingback. Although he started him at center forward in the Nations League final, Berhalter said he views Wright as more of a winger. And I think that's probably because he's worried about the wing depth beyond Pulisic and maybe he's also considering dropping Weah back into a full-back role. Given the midfield depth, both Reyna and Malik Tillman could end up as wing options, too.

In Pulisic, you have a Champions League-level winger. In Wright, you have a dominant Championship-level winger. Outside of them, you have a few guys who struggled for consistent playing time in the Bundesliga, some MLS lifers, a guy doing well in Liga MX, a couple prospects from lower-tier European clubs and a handful of MLS prospects who haven't quite kicked on yet.

Here is my groundbreaking analysis: The USMNT should really hope that Pulisic doesn't get hurt.

1. Folarin Balogun, Monaco

2. Josh Sargent, Norwich City

3. Ricardo Pepi, PSV Eindhoven

4. Jesús Ferreira, FC Dallas

5. Jordan Pefok, Borussia Monchengladbach

After cycling through every center-forward option on the roster at the World Cup and finding none of them to be satisfactory, the USMNT's center-forward depth suddenly looks ... OK?

Balogun only played about half of the available minutes for Monaco this season. And he only scored seven goals. But he added five assists, and his underlying numbers were significantly better than his goal-scoring output. The 22-year-old averaged 3.4 shots per 90 minutes for a total of 8.5 non-penalty xG:

Per FBref's similar player algorithm, the three most similar players across Europe's Big Five leagues to Balogun are: 1) Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, 2) RB Leipzig's Loïs Openda and 3) Liverpool's Darwin Núñez. I'm buying low on Balogun, and it wouldn't surprise me if he had a big summer for the USMNT. Especially if Wright is more of a winger right now, Balogun should be the starter in game one of the Copa America.

Behind him, Sargent lit up the Championship for Norwich. I'm not sure he'll ever get beyond ""very good Championship attacker"" but there's nothing wrong with that -- and it certainly doesn't preclude contributing to the national team. Pepi couldn't find starter's minutes for PSV, but he consistently produced off the bench.

That's it for the Copa America candidates, but Ferreira has played well for the USMNT (even if his finishing frequently frustrates fans), Pefok got decent minutes in the Bundesliga this season, Vázquez has sometimes been great for Monterrey and White continues to be one of the most consistent attackers in MLS.

Center forward, then, provides a lesson for every other section of this list: At a micro and macro level, soccer is incredibly unpredictable. What looks like a weakness or a strength right now could be the opposite once the next World Cup rolls around.",insider.espn.com,news,ESPN.com (Insider),,0.2705882352941176,454601644,28,https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0527%2Fsoc_ranking_the_top_15_usmnt_players_new_16x9.jpg,

Thibaut Courtois has been left out of Belgium's squad for Euro 2024.

The Real Madrid goalkeeper has been recovering from an ACL injury after missing most of the season but is expected to start the Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday.

Courtois, who has earned 102 caps for his country has been snubbed by head coach Domenico Tedesco in favour of Koen Casteels, Thomas Kaminski and Matz Sels.

He had previously said the 32-year-old would not be selected as he been out of action for so long and has followed through on his promise.

A year ago, Tedesco also claimed Courtois refused to travel to join up with the squad after being overlooked for the captaincy.

But this time, it seems there has been an agreement between both parties to suggest he is simply not ready for a busy summer.

Tedesco said: ""Courtois was very clear and honest and early in his communication.

""The latest information we received is that he is not ready for the European Championships. He knows his body best.""

There are plenty of star-studded names that have been included in Belgium's squad for Euro 2024, including eight Premier League players.

Manchester City's duo of Kevin De Bruyne and Jeremy Doku are both selected while Arsenal's Leandro Trossard, Aston Villa's Youri Tielemans, Everton midfielder Amadou Onana, Leicester defender Wout Faes and Fulham's Timothy Castagne have also been named.

On loan Roma striker Romelu Lukaku will be playing in Germany after enjoying a brilliant campaign in Italy while there has been a shock recall for Atletico Madrid's Alex Witsel, who had previously retired from international football.

Belgium can add one more player to their squad before the 7 June deadline.

They will open their Euro 2024 campaign against Slovakia on 17 June before facing Romania and Ukraine alongside them in Group E.

Goalkeepers: Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest), Koen Casteels (Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton)

Defenders: Wout Faes (Leicester), Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Arthur Theate (Rennes), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge)

Midfielders: Aster Vranckx (Wolfsburg), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Orel Mangala (Lyon), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Amadou Onana (Everton)

Harry Kane may once again be looking around in envy at some of his former team-mates who have gone on to win major honours since departing Tottenham.

The striker made a £100million switch to Bayern Munich last summer partly in the hope that he could finally win a major domestic title. And despite his eye-watering 44-goal haul across all competitions this season, the Englishman will go another season without winning a major domestic trophy.

While Kane's situation may be one exeption, several of his former team-mates have gone on to win major honours in the past few years, including Lucas Moura.

The Brazilian famously fired Spurs into the 2019 Champions League final with a trio of goals against Ajax. Yet, his side fell short in the final suffering defeat by Liverpool.

But along with Luka Modric and DeAndre Yedlin, the Brazilian has departed Spurs and has clinched silverware with a new club.

Mail Sport has taken a look at 49 former Spurs players and managers to have lifted a trophy since Tottenham's Carling Cup success in 2008.

Titles won: Brazilian Cup

Like Tottenham, Sao Paulo had been experiencing a trophy drought of their own. Their last title came nearly 12 years ago, but in 2023, the team, buoyed by the recent arrival of their talisman winger Moura, finally ended their wait.

The 31-year-old had returned to his former club last summer and helped guide them to win the highly coveted Copa do Brazil Cup 2-1 (on aggregate) against Flamengo in September 2023.

Lucas Moura (pictured) won the Copa Do Brazil in September 2023 after leaving Tottenham earlier that year

Serge Aurier

Titles won: Turkish Super Cup

Aurier's four-year spell at Tottenham came to an abrupt end back in 2021 after he and the club mutually agreed to terminate his contract.

Since then he has played with several teams around Europe, notably signing for Villarreal, before being released again as a free agent one season later. He'd go on to join Nottingham Forest in 2022 before signing for Galatasaray in February.

His side would go on to win the Turkish Super Cup in April, besting Fenerbache 3-0 in the final. While Aurier did not come on during the final, he was named on the bench for the match.

The right back would also help Ivory Coast clinch the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this season.

Victor Wanyama

Titles won: Canadian Cup

Tottenham parted company with Wanyama back in 2020, with the defensive midfielder moving to CF Montreal on a free transfer.

His exit appeared to leave a sour taste in the mouth after Wanyama had told The Athletic that he had been 'p***** off' that he was omitted from Spurs' 2019 Champions League final squad.

Despite that, he'd go on to win the the Canadian Cup in his first full season at the club.

DeAndre Yedlin

Titles won: The Leagues Cup

The 30-year-old defender left Tottenham in 2016, going on to play for Newcastle and Galatasaray before he would arrive at Inter Miami in 2022.

And alongside Lionel Messi, he'd go on to help guide David Beckham's MLS franchise to Leagues Cup glory in 2023, with his side defeating Nashville on penalties in the final last August.

Erik Lamela

Titles won: Europa League

The feisty Argentine was able to celebrate the first major silverware of his career by lifting the Europa League title on Wednesday.

The 31-year-old slotted home his penalty to help Sevilla beat Roma 4-1 on penalties in Budapest, although Jose Mourinho argued he should have seen a yellow card beforehand.

Lamela had previously received runners-up medals twice with Argentina in the Copa America, the Champions League and League Cup at Spurs and the Coppa Italia with Roma.

Bryan Gil

Titles won: Europa League

The Spaniard returned to Sevilla in January on loan in search of increased game time and will certainly feel he made the right decision after picking up a Europa League winners medal.

The 22-year-old started the final but was taken off at half-time with the Spaniards trailing.

Benjamin Stambouli

Titles Won: Ligue 1, French Cup, French League Cup, French Super Cup

After departing Spurs for PSG in 2015, Stambouli went on to win silverware with the French giants immediately, clinching the 2015-16 Ligue 1 title, the French League Cup and the French Cup in the same year.

He'd also win the French Super Cup that season too, before going on to win it again in 2015-16.

Benjamin Stambouli (pictured) would go on to clinch several titles with Paris Saint-Germain

Carlos Vinicius

Titles won: Dutch Cup, Dutch Super Cup, Turkish Super Lig and Turkish Super Cup

The Brazilian joined Tottenham on loan from Benfica for the 2020-21 season. Since leaving north London, the 29-year-old forward has gone on to achieve success at several clubs around Europe, winning four titles.

The following season he'd join PSV Eindhoven on loan, helping the Eredivisie side win the Dutch Cup and the Super Cup. He'd later join Galatasaray on loan, winning both the Turkish Super Lig and the Turkish Super Cup.

Tanguy Ndombele

Titles won: Serie A title

The French midfielder failed to shine at Spurs but is expected to return to the club this summer following his loan spell at Napoli.

Ndombele was part of Luciano Spalletti's squad that claimed Napoli's first Serie A title since 1990.

His impact was limited though, making only eight starts in the league this season.

Pierluigi Gollini

Titles won: Serie A

Following a year-long loan spell at the club, Gollini would return to his parent club Atalanta. He'd subsequently go out on loan again to Fiorentina the following season before moving to Napoli.

Here he'd make seven appearances during Napoli's title winning 2022-23 campaign, helping the side clinch their first Serie A title since 1990.

Giovani Lo Celso

Titles won: Finalissima

Lo Celso joined Spurs in the same summer as Ndombele back in 2019, but has now spent 18 months on loan at Villarreal with the move allowing him to become a key part of Argentina's squad.

While he won the Copa America during his time with Spurs, the Argentine won the Finalissima against Italy at Wembley last year.

Toby Alderweireld

Titles won: Qatar Cup, Belgium Cup

The Belgian defender had won league titles with Ajax and Atletico Madrid before joining Tottenham and has picked up silverware for his latest two clubs after leaving north London.

The veteran defender earned the Qatar Cup last year during a spell with Al-Duhail, while he also lifted the Belgian Cup with Royal Antwerp this season.

A potential league title is also on the way with his hometown club.

Jan Vertonghen

Titles won: Portuguese League

The long-term defensive partner to Alderweireld at Ajax, Tottenham and Belgium has also recently got his hands on another trophy.

The 36-year-old claimed the Primeira Liga title with Benfica last season, before moving on to Anderlecht.

Juan Foyth

Titles won: Europa League, World Cup

The Argentine defender has enjoyed success with both club and country since signing for Villarreal in 2020.

Foyth helped the Spanish side beat Manchester United in the Europa League final in 2021, before winning the Finalissima last year.

While he only played four minutes in Qatar, Foyth was part of Argentina's World Cup winning squad last year.

Juan Foyth helped the Spanish side Villareal beat Man United in the 2021 Europa League final

Kieran Trippier

Titles won: LaLiga

Trippier fell short of winning silverware this season at Newcastle with the Magpies losing to Man United in the Carabao Cup final, but will be playing Champions League football next term.

He is one of only four Englishmen to have won LaLiga however, having been part of Diego Simeone's triumphant squad back in 2021, before returning to the Premier League.

Cameron Carter-Vickers

Titles won: Scottish Premiership (x2), Scottish League Cup (x2)

Spurs academy produced Carter-Vickers has enjoyed life north of the border with four trophies secured at Celtic in his two seasons at the club.

The US international has won the Scottish Premiership and League Cup on two occasions with the Bhoys.

A potential treble could be achieved in the Scottish FA Cup final this weekend.

Cameron Carter-Vickers has won four trophies since joining Celtic two seasons ago

Joe Hart

Titles won: Scottish Premiership (x2), Scottish League Cup (x2)

The former England goalkeeper has scooped the same four honours as Carter-Vickers since joining Celtic, adding to the two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups with Manchester City.

Dimitar Berbatov

Titles won: Premier League (x3) Club World Cup, English League Cup

One of the members of Spurs' Carling Cup triumph, Dimitar Berbatov left that very summer and was granted a big-money move to Manchester United.

The move paid off for the Bulgarian where he won three Premier League titles, a Club World Cup and a League Cup all during a four-year stint at Old Trafford.

Dimitar Berbatov left Tottenham to join Manchester United, where he won three league titles

Robbie Keane

Titles won: MLS Cup (x3), MLS Supporter's Shield

Along with Berbatov, Robbie Keane was a part of the Spurs squad that beat Chelsea in the 2008 Carling Cup final at Wembley, where he would cement himself as a club legend.

After a failed stint at Liverpool and then return to Spurs, Keane went on to LA Galaxy where he won four more titles, lifting the MLS Cup three times along with the MLS Supporter's Shield.

Teemu Tainio

Titles won: Eredivisie, Finnish League (x2), Finnish Cup

Another member of the Carling Cup squad, Teemu Tainio enjoyed more success across the continent, winning the Eredivisie with Ajax before winning the Finnish Cup and Finnish top flight on two separate occasions with HJK.

Lee Young-pyo

Titles won: Saudi Arabian League (x2), Saudi Cup (x2)

Lee Young-pyo helped Spurs secure Carling Cup glory before leaving in the summer to join Borussia Dortmund for a year.

While he won no silverware in Germany, the South Korean would finally get his hands on another trophy after moving to the Middle East, where he was the Saudi Arabian League and Saudi Cup on two different occasions with Al-Hilal.

Kevin-Prince Boateng

Titles won: LaLiga, Serie A, Italian Cup, German Cup

While Kevin-Prince Boateng's time at Tottenham was brief and not at all noteworthy, he did play a part in helping the club reach the Carling Cup final but didn't play in it.

However, his time did eventually fizzle out and he was sold to Portsmouth. Boateng eventually made his way to AC Milan, where he won the Serie A and Supercoppa Italiana before winning more silverware in Germany and Spain.

Kevin-Prince Boateng (second left) won titles in Spain, Italy and with Frankfurt in Germany

Hossam Ghaly

Titles won: Egyptian League (x4), Egyptian Cup, CAF Champions League, CAF Confederation Cup, African Cup of Nations

Another alumni of Spurs' Carling Cup-winning squad, Hossam Ghaly eventually made his way back to his native Egypt where he enjoyed a lot of success.

Ghaly went on to win the Egyptian League four times, the Egyptian Cup along with the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup with El Ahly Cairo.

Ghaly also won the African Cup of Nations with Egypt in 2010.

Adel Taarabt

Titles won: Portuguese League, Portuguese Super Cup

Moroccan magician Adel Taarabt arrived at Spurs with plenty of potential but the north London club failed to harness it before he was allowed to leave 2009.

While he did help QPR win the Championship and gain promotion back to the Premier League, Taarabt got his hands on some silverware when he won Liga NOS with Benfica in 2019.

He also won the Portuguese Super Cup in that same year.

Adel Taarabt got his hands on silverware when he won the cup double with Benfica in 2019

Tomas Pekhart

Titles won: Czech League, Polish League (x2), Polish Cup, Israeli League, Greek Cup

Having featured for Spurs' Under 18 side, Tomas Pekhart made his break away from White Hart Lane across Europe, winning the Czech League title, Israeli League title and the Greek Cup with AEK Athens.

He has also won the Polish League and Cup with Legia Warsaw

Didier Zokora

Titles won: Spanish Cup

After tasting Carling Cup glory with Spurs in 2008, Didier Zokora came close to winning the trophy again the following season but fell short in the final against Manchester United.

Zokora would only lift one more trophy after leaving Spurs where he would win the Copa del Rey with Sevilla in 2010.

Kyle Walker

Titles won: Champions League, Premier League (x6), FA Cup (x2), League Cup (x4), Community Shield (x2), FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup

Having come close to winning breaking Spurs' trophy drought in 2015 after finishing as runners-up once again in the League Cup, Kyle Walker departed Spurs for Man City in a record £54m move.

Walker saw success straight away, winning the Premier League and League Cup double in his first year at the Etihad before going on to lift the FA Cup the following season.

Walker has since earned a further two Premier League winner's medals along with three more Carabao Cups and two Community Shields.

In the past 12 months, Walker has added more silverware to his trophy cabinet, winning the Treble with Man City last season, before clinching his sixth Premier League title last week.

Paul-Jose Mpoku

Titles won: Belgian Cup

Paul-Jose Mpoku arrived at Spurs' youth academy in 2008 but left the club three years later without making a single senior appearance.

He would try his hand at Italian and Greek football before returning to Standard Liege, where he had previously featured in their academy.

He went on to lift the Belgian Cup in 2018 but that remained his only piece of silverware in his career.

Bongani Khumalo

Titles won: South African League (x4), South African Cup

Another strange purchase by Spurs that went on to achieve nothing at the club, Bongani Khumalo left the club without a trace, making just seven appearances for the Under 23s side before returning to Africa to play for SuperSport United.

He went on to win the South African League four times while adding a South African Cup to his collection.

Roman Pavlyuchenko

Titles won: Russian Cup

Roman Pavlyuchenko was signed by Tottenham off the back of an impressive showing at Euro 2008 with Russia, where he was named in the Team of the Tournament.

After a four-year stint in north London, Pavlyuchenko would go on to win the Russian Cup with Lokomotiv Moscow in 2015, which was the only title he claimed after leaving Spurs.

Vedran Corluka

Titles won: Russian League, Russian Cup (x4), Russian Super Cup

Vedran Corluka, affectionately known as 'Charlie' in the Tottenham terraces, left the club after four years at the club in 2012 and would go on to finish his playing career out in Russia.

It was there where he enjoyed the most success of his career, winning the Russian Premier League, the Russian Cup (four times) and the Russian Super Cup.

Former Spurs defender Vedran Corluka celebrates after winning the 2019 Russian Super Cup

Simon Dawkins

Titles won: MLS Supporter's Shield, Caribbean Cup

Having rise through the ranks at Spurs, Simon Dawkins failed to break into the first team under Martin Jol.

After leaving the club before returning for another three-year stint in 2011, Dawkins tried his luck across the pond with the San Jose Earthquakes.

He would go on to win the MLS Supporter's Shield during his time in North America.

Luka Modric

Titles won: UEFA Champions League (x5), LaLiga (x4), Spanish Cup (x2), Spanish Super Cup (x4), FIFA Club World Cup (x4), UEFA Super Cup (x4)

Arguably the former Spurs players that's enjoyed the most success since leaving the club, Luka Modric went on to become an all-time great at Real Madrid, winning five Champions Leagues, three LaLiga titles, the FIFA Club World Cup five times and four UEFA Super Cups.

While most other players on this list have won domestic cups in lesser-known leagues, Kane will be aiming to replicate what Modric has achieved by winning major honours should he leave Tottenham.

Luka Modric became a Real Madrid icon since leaving Spurs, winning 17 titles in total

Rafael van der Vaart

Titles won: Danish League

A real fan favourite at the Lane, Rafael van der Vaart endeared himself to the club's supporters when he arrived on deadline day from Real Madrid and his goals against Arsenal only made that much more popular.

While he admits he left prematurely in 2012, he did get his hands on a trophy down the line, winning the Danish League with FC Midtjylland in the 2017-18 season.

Gareth Bale

Titles won: UEFA Champions League (x5), LaLiga (x3), Spanish Cup, Spanish Super Cup (x2), FIFA Club World Cup (x3), UEFA Super Cup (x2), MLS Cup, Supporters Shield

Copy and paste from Modric. Arriving a season later than the Croatian, Bale has done it and won it all with Los Blancos.

The Welshman is the most decorated British players to go overseas and is the man for the big occasion, scoring multiple times in Champions League finals. Another benchmark for Kane.

Bale even returned to Spurs and left again to claim more silverware in the United States with LA Galaxy, before retiring shortly after the World Cup in Qatar.

Jermain Defoe

Titles won: Scottish Premiership

Jermain Defoe helped Steven Gerrard's Rangers side win their first Scottish Premiership title in over a decade in 2021 - and they managed to do it while going undefeated.

Jermain Defoe (bottom left) helped Rangers win the Scottish Premiership in 2022

Clint Dempsey

Titles won: MLS Cup, MLS Supporter's Shield, US Open Cup

Former Fulham forward and part-time rapper Clint Dempsey left Spurs after just one season in 2013 and returned to the United States to see out the rest of his career with Seattle Sounders.

He would lift the MLS Cup, MLS Supporter's Shield and US Open Cup during his five years at the club before retiring.

Tomislav Gomelt

Titles won: Romanian Cup

Another player for the 'didn't play for Tottenham' category, Tomislav Gomelt rose through the academy before being shipped out on loan a number of times without making a senior appearance.

He would eventually find himself at Bari, but it was while he was out on loan at CFR Cluj that he would win the 2015-16 Romanian Cup.

Paulinho

Titles won: LaLiga, Spanish Cup, Chinese League (x4), Chinese Cup, Chinese Super Cup (x2), AFC Champions League

One of the seven players brought to the club using the 'Bale money', Paulinho was a complete flop at the club and would only last two seasons before Spurs cut their losses and sold him to China's Guangzhou Evergrande in 2015.

After winning back-to-back Chinese Super League titles, Paulinho was bizarrely bought by Barcelona but it proved to be a huge hit, with the midfielder helping the Catalan side win LaLiga and Copa del Rey in 2017-18 before returning to China.

Paulinho won titles in China and in Spain with Barcelona after struggling in north London

Vincent Janssen

Titles won: Mexican League, Mexican Cup, Belgian Cup

Another striker that just didn't cut it at the club was Vincent Janssen.

Bought for £17m in 2016, the Dutchman was shown the exit three years later, where he would end up at Mexican outfit Monterrey.

In his debut season for the club, Janssen managed to win the Mexican League and Mexican Cup to add his first bits of silverware to his CV.

Janssen is now with Royal Antwerp where he secured the Belgian Cup with Alderweireld.

Vincent Janssen managed to win the Mexican League and Mexican Cup in 2019

Georges-Kevin N'Koudou

Titles won: Turkish League, Turkish Cup, Turkish Super Cup

The Cameroon international was remarkably on Spurs books for four years, with two loan spells away from the club.

Nkoudou moved to Turkey permanently in 2019 and was part of the Besiktas side that lifted the Turkish Super Lig and Turkish Cup in 2021, before going to win the Turkish Super Cup.

Christian Eriksen

Titles won: Serie A, Carabao Cup, FA Cup

While Kane is struggling for silverware in north London, former team-mate Christian Eriksen secured the Serie A title with Inter Milan in his first full season at the club.

The Dane was part of Man United's Carabao Cup winning squad this season and could add the FA Cup to his list of honours on Saturday.

Christian Eriksen helped Inter Milan topple Juventus to win a Scudetto in his first full season

Fernando Llorente

Titles won: Italian Cup

Fernando Llorente played second fiddle to Kane during his stint at Spurs and was allowed to leave after the club's Champions League final defeat in Madrid.

In his first season with Napoli, the Spaniard won the Coppa Italia, beating Juventus in the final.

Giovani dos Santos

Titles won: CONCACAF Gold Cup (x2), Mexican Super Cup

The one-time Barcelona wonderkid has won three CONCACAF Gold Cup titles in his career, two of which came after leaving Spurs.

Dos Santos also lifted the Mexican Super Cup with America in 2019.

ManagersJose Mourinho

Titles won: Europa Conference League

Since being ousted from Spurs in April 2021 - making them the first club he had departed without winning a trophy in nearly 20 years - he moved to Roma.

In his first season in charge, he ended their trophy drought by guiding the side to the inaugural Europa Conference League title, defeating Feyenoord in the final.

Mourinho subsequently parted company with Roma earlier this year, having lost the Europa League final to Sevilla.

Nuno Espirito Santo

Titles won: Saudi Pro League, Saudi Super Cup

Nuno Espirito Santo was appointed manager at Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad in July 2022, eight months after being fired at Tottenham.

In his first year, he guided the side to Saudi Super Cup glory in January, and then ended a 14-year title drought to seal the Saudi Professional League with one game remaining, as they finished ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo's Al-Nassr.

Mauricio Pochettino

Titles won: Ligue 1, French Cup, French Super Cup

After his Spurs spell ended in 2019, Pochettino took over the reins at PSG in January 2021, where he previously featured as a player.

In the first two weeks of an 18-month contract, he led the side to win the French Super Cup after beating Marseille 2-1.

They beat Monaco in the Coupe de France final later that same season, and clinched the Ligue 1 title in the following campaign, after overthrowing Lille, who had beaten them to the title in 2021 by just one point.

Pochettino subsequently left PSG before joining Chelsea but recently left the club by mutual consent.

Andre Villas-Boas

Titles won: Russian Premier League, Russian Cup, Russian Super Cup

After his Tottenham exit in December 2013, Andre Villas-Boas found success in a spell as manager of Zenit Saint-Petersburg.

After falling narrowly short in his first season, Villas-Boas led the side to the Russian Premier League title in 2015.

The following season, they won the Russian Super Cup on penalties against Lokomotiv Moscow, and then the Russian Cup by beating CSKA Moscow in the final. It was his last achievement before returning to Portugal.",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,0.2392156862745098,454536661,37,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/27/20/85394665-0-image-m-17_1716839313308.jpg,

Arsenal are preparing for their second consecutive Champions League campaign after narrowly missing out on the Premier League title to reigning champions Manchester City.

Next season will see significant changes to UEFA's flagship event, with the number of competing teams increasing from 32 to 36. The traditional group stage is being replaced by a league stage, where each team will face two clubs from the four seeding pots.

Seeding pots will now be determined by coefficients, moving away from the previous system which was based on the holders, Europa League winners and domestic champions.

Germany has secured a fifth Champions League spot due to their superior coefficient rating, while Atalanta's recent success has earned Italy an impressive six spots.

Due to their six-year absence from the Champions League prior to this season, Arsenal are expected to compete in the second seeding block alongside Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen, Atletico Madrid and Atalanta.

This situation could lead to a challenging Champions League campaign for Arsenal, as the first pot seeds have been confirmed to include Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool, Inter, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Barcelona.

The Gunners are below Liverpool despite finishing higher than them in the Premier League in both of the last two seasons.That is because of the Reds' superior UEFA coefficient courtesy of their performances in Europe in recent years.

Pot two has been confirmed to include Bayer Leverkusen, Atletico Madrid, Atalanta, Juventus, Benfica, Arsenal, Club Brugge and AC Milan, with Shakhtar Donetsk expected to join them through qualifying.

Seven more spots are up for grabs in the qualification stage. If things go as planned, Aston Villa will find themselves in pot four alongside Monaco, Stuttgart and Bologna, while pot three could see Celtic, Feyenoord, Sporting CP and PSV.

The group-stage phase will now feature eight games instead of six. The top eight teams will advance to the last 16, while those ranked ninth to 24th will compete in a play-off to join them.

Teams placed 25th to 36th, along with the losing eight sides, will be eliminated from the competition.

Clubs from the same country cannot face each other, which means Arsenal, City, Liverpool and Aston Villa will not be pitted against each other.

In a worst-case scenario, Arsenal may have to contend with Bayern Munich and Barcelona from Pot 1 and Bayer Leverkusen and Juventus from Pot 2.",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,0.4666666666666666,454536530,1,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFP__20240527__34TW9AM__v2__Preview__FblEuro2024Esp-640x360.jpg,

The result of a major collective effort during 18 months of rebuilding under Unai Emery saw Villa return to UEFA's elite competition for the first time in four decades. Now new generations of the club's fans will be able to witness the one-time European Cup winners back on a stage not many predicted they would be on.

Entering alongside Premier League victors Manchester City, runners-up Arsenal and third-placed Liverpool, Villa and the English contingent will immediately be thrown in at the deep end as they must traverse an entirely new Champions League format. Instead of 32 teams split into eight individual groups, an increased 36 teams will compete in one giant league table.

Known as the 'Swiss model', a club will face eight different opponents in what has been rebranded from the traditional group stage to the 'league stage'. This means two extra matches than previously for everyone involved, with four taking place at home and the other four away, rather than three opponents faced twice each.

The points and goal differences are totted up in a collective standings, with the top eight teams automatically qualifying for the knockout stages. Those ranked ninth through to 24th are then placed in a play-off round to determine the competition's last 16, from which point normal service resumes, albeit with the addition of seeding.

Of the 36 teams that will be involved, 29 have so far been whittled down for the league phase. The outcome of Saturday's final for the 2023/24 season will see one final team added - Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine if Real Madrid win, or Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany if Borussia Dortmund are successful - before the final six are confirmed via qualifying rounds this summer.

Every single club possesses what is called a UEFA coefficient - a number based on continental performance over the last five seasons. This is ultimately used to place the teams into the pots used to draw from, with the league stage being picked on August 29.

With many domestic competitions wrapping up over the weekend, Villa now have a much clearer image of who will be involved. Here are the qualified clubs, how they have achieved this and their respective coefficients. Those listed with an asterisk are not yet assured of a league place and await future results for exact confirmation:

Arne Slot has managed in the competition before, but this time, his side will be among the favorites to win it.

The Reds are six-time European champions -- only Real Madrid and AC Milan have claimed the honor on more occasions -- and are back among the continent's elite having secured a third-placed finish in the Premier League. Last winning the tournament in 2019, alongside Real Madrid, Manchester City and Arsenal, Liverpool will be among the leading contenders to go all the way to Budapest.

To do that, though, Liverpool will have to adjust to the new-look competition format. Instead of an initial eight groups of four, there is now just one single league table including all the teams -- four more than previously, with 36 sides qualifying.

Rather than being split into separate groups as before, there will be one league table in the so-called Swiss model. Teams will play eight matches (two more than before) and each fixture will be against a different team rather than playing home and away.

The top eight teams in the table automatically qualify for the knockout stages with the next 16 facing a two-legged play-off to proceed. There is then a knockout phase as there was before, though this will be seeded.

Liverpool, along with Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Barcelona, will be in pot one for the draw. The pots are based on club performance in European competitions in the last five years. Atalanta's victory over Torino on Sunday, which secured their top-four finish in Serie A, meant that Benfica, not Roma, qualified directly to the group stage. The draw for the group phase will take place on Thursday, August 29.

Aston Villa, of course, is the English team qualified that hasn't already been mentioned here. Girona and Atlético Madrid are in from Spain, Brest, Monaco and PSG from France, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord represent the Netherlands, Sporting Lisbon is in from Portugal, Celtic and Sturm Graz respectively represent Scotland and Austria, and Club Brugge will be there from Belgium.

Italy and Germany have each earned an extra fifth place because of their teams doing well in Europe this year, with AC Milan, Juventus and Bologna qualifying as a result. Tottenham finished fifth in the Premier League but missed out because the likes of Manchester United and Newcastle crashed out of the Champions League in this season's groups.

Only one more spot in the tournament is yet to be decided aside from the play-offs and that will rest on the outcome of the Champions League final at Wembley next Saturday. If Real Madrid emerges victorious, Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine will automatically secure their position. However, if Borussia Dortmund come out on top, the place will go to their fellow German side, Eintracht Frankfurt because Klopp's former side has already qualified via the Bundesliga standings but the Bundesliga has a strong coefficient.

Liverpool.com says: Whenever the Reds are involved in the Champions League these days, they should go into it thinking that they should have a really good chance of winning it.

Inconsolable Leeds United players did not need a microphone thrust in front of them to confirm it was the lowest point of theirs. The tears shed at full-time told you as much as Archie Gray buried his head in Daniel Farke's chest at Wembley.

How Adam Armstrong's goal will replay in their minds in the coming days, weeks and, even, months. How they will regret that they only mustered two measly efforts on target in this Championship play-off final. How they will rue that it is the Kassam that awaits next season rather than Anfield following this devastating 1-0 defeat.

""When you have a look at how young my side is, a player like Armstrong, who knows this league and such situations inside out, has this one situation,"" Farke told reporters. ""When it counts in the crunch time, he is really fully on it and it was a pretty clinical strike. That was the difference.""

You can't say Leeds had not been warned - long before Armstrong opened the scoring midway through the first half. Following a decent start, and after forcing Southampton into some uncharacteristic misplaced passes, the Whites were thrown by the Saints' first attack in the 12th minute when Armstrong, somehow, found himself in space in the box to pull the ball across goal. Joe Rodon managed to get there ahead of Will Smallbone to prevent the Ireland international from opening the scoring. but it planted a seed of doubt. That certainly did not go unnoticed by Southampton boss Russell Martin.

""I felt that changed the game a little bit for us and put a little bit more fear into Leeds about pressing so aggressively,"" he said.

That was evident in the build-up to Armstrong's opener. Southampton's back three were camped inside Leeds' half and no one got tight enough to Taylor Harwood-Bellis, who was able to pass the ball to Flynn Downes. The midfielder immediately played a clever reverse pass to Will Smallbone, who found himself in a huge gap between the lines.

Ethan Ampadu stepped forward to close down Smallbone, but the centre-back left an acre of space behind him for Armstrong to run into. Smallbone duly slipped Armstrong in and the Southampton striker took a touch before drilling the ball across Illan Meslier to put his side ahead. It was the difference between the two sides in a nutshell.

For all Leeds' possession and territory, the Whites failed to seriously test McCarthy from a series of decent areas in the opening 80 minutes. The quality of those openings were why Leeds finished with a slightly higher expected goals figure (0.69) than Southampton (0.61) but, unlike opposite number Armstrong, Joel Piroe had little to feed off. The striker failed to even have a single shot against a side the Dutchman could have been lining up for once upon a time.

Southampton, after all, were among those clubs who had previously shown an interest in Piroe. As did champions Leicester City and Europa League winners Atalanta for that matter. However, it was Leeds who pushed for a striker who scored 19 goals in the Championship last season. Not only did Leeds go to the very top, to Swansea City's owners, to get the £10.5m deal done - technical director Gretar Steinsson personally flew out to the Netherlands to meet Piroe, his family and agent Theo Roebbers.

""He told us why Leeds were interested in Joel and we had that conversation in a few hours,"" Roebbers recalled to Leeds Live. ""If a technical director is coming from England to Holland to say how much they like Joel and why they like him, that's a club we trust.

""They studied him. There was interest from other clubs, but we think Leeds is where he can go to the next level.

""He came from PSV Eindhoven to Swansea and is in his development and has to learn some things while getting the chance to play and make the next step because he is not at the top of the stairs. Maybe in one or two years he will be.""

Those words serve as a timely reminder that this is a 24-year-old with his best years ahead of him, which is also true of those around Piroe, whose futures at Elland Road look far from certain. There were only three individuals aged 25 or older in Leeds' starting line-up. Junior Firpo was this side's elder statesman...at 27. Southampton's starters, in contrast, were four years older on average with Alex McCarthy, Jack Stephens and Ryan Fraser all in their thirties.

Although this Leeds side accumulated 90 points, a huge tally, did that lack of experience ultimately show even under a promotion specialist like Farke? Leeds only lost six of their first 40 league fixtures this season but when the pressure was really on, the Whites suffered five defeats in their final nine games of the campaign.

Having done so well to recover and rediscover their mojo with a superb 4-0 win against Norwich in the semi-finals, Leeds could not get over the line at Wembley despite boasting a starting front four that had been directly involved in 80 goals in the Championship this season - and that is without even mentioning the contributions of Dan James, Jaidon Anthony and Patrick Bamford, who was injured on Sunday. These are players who previously tormented sides up and down the country. Just ask former Swansea boss Michael Duff.

""At this level, other than possibly Leicester's, three of those seven get in pretty much everyone's front three,"" he told Leeds Live. ""That's the beauty that Farke's got, but there's a real cohesion to them as well. They're not a team of individuals.

""They're not just interested in the ball. They're aggressive in the press. That's what they ended up doing to us. They strangled us in the end.""

However, damningly, on Sunday, Leeds' starting forwards could only manage a single effort on target between them on the big stage. It said it all that Farke substituted Gnonto, an Italy international, midway through the second half while Summerville was hooked with a quarter of an hour to go.

It was only when Dan James entered the fray that Leeds carried a real threat after the substitute rattled the underside of the bar and then had a late effort parried by McCarthy. It was ultimately too little too late.",leeds-live.co.uk,news,leedslive,Ciaran Kelly,0.08235294117647052,454485767,1,https://i2-prod.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/article29244252.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Untitled-design.png,eng-9601111

But Liverpool and the Champions League are back together in a relationship that has proven profitable for the Reds in recent times.

The six-time European champions - only Real Madrid and AC Milan have claimed the honour on more occasions - are back among the Continent's elite having earned an impressive third-placed finish in the Premier League.

Liverpool reached three finals under Jurgen Klopp, beaten by Real in 2018 and 2022 but triumphant against Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid in 2019.

New head coach Arne Slot has had experience in the competition while in charge of Feyenoord, and will lead the Reds into a new era with the Champions League having had the biggest overhaul since its inception more than 30 years ago.

Instead of an initial eight groups of four, there is now just one single league table including all the teams, the total of which has been bumped up from 32 to 36. Clubs will play eight games - an increase on the current six - with four at home and four away, all of which will be against different opponents.

The top eight teams in the table automatically qualify for the knockout stages with the next 16 facing a two-legged play-off to proceed, with games dependent on league position - ninth v 24th, 10th v 23rd and so on. The competition then continues as normal from the last 16 onwards as a knockout. The bottom 12 teams in the league are eliminated from European qualification altogether - no more dropping into the Europa League.

While one big group, there will still be four pots of nine teams to help determine the fixtures, ordered solely on club performance in European competition in the last five years. Liverpool are in pot one along with Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Barcelona.

The latter place was only decided on Sunday night when already-qualified Atalanta's win over Torino ensured they finished in the top four in Serie A. This meant that Benfica and not Roma qualified directly to the group stage.

While seven clubs will progress through the qualifying rounds, the majority of other places in the league have been confirmed. Arsenal and Aston Villa are in from England, Girona and Atletico Madrid from Spain, Brest and Monaco have joined PSG from France, Holland are represented by PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord, Sporting Lisbon are also in from Portugal, while Scotland and Austria are represented by Celtic and Sturm Graz respectively. Club Brugge sealed Belgium's spot on Sunday evening.

Italy and Germany earned an extra fifth place, with AC Milan, Juventus and Bologna qualifying from the former and Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt the latter.

Which leaves just one place, which is determined by whoever wins the Champions League final at Wembley next Saturday. Should Real Madrid triumph, the automatic league berth will go to Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine. But if Borussia Dortmund prevail, it will be handed to fellow German side Eintracht Frankfurt.",liverpoolecho.co.uk,news,Liverpool Echo,Ian Doyle,0.4039215686274509,454478719,1,https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article25450316.ece/alternates/s1200/1_gettyimages-1239288092-1.jpg,eng-9602216

The Bergamo side - who already grabbed a Champions League spot by ending Bayer Leverkusen's 51-game unbeaten with a resounding 3-0 victory in the Europa League final on Wednesday - secured a top four finish in Italy with a 3-0 home win against Torino. Bizarrely, La Dea still have one more league fixture to fulfill, and a win against Conference League finalists Fiorentina next Sunday could see them jump above Juventus into third place. Their success in qualifying for the Champions League has positive repercussions for Philippe Clement and Rangers, who now know they will be seeded for both the third qualifying round and play-off if they reach that stage in their quest to join Celtic at Europe's top table next season.

Being seeded for both qualifiers should also present a slightly easier route to the potential riches of the newly revamped Champions League with Rangers now set to avoid coming up against Benfica in both rounds. The Portuguese giants have also benefitted as they've been handed a direct ticket into the big time and will not need to enter the lottery of qualifying.

The Light Blues are looking to make amends for their showing in the Champions League qualifying rounds at the start of last season, with Michael Beale's team crashing out at the final hurdle after a heavy 7-3 defeat to PSV over two legs. The third qualifying round of the 2024/25 Champions League will get underway over weeks on August 6/7, with the return leg coming a week later.

After the World Cup, winning a continental competition is the biggest honour for a footballer at international level.

And if that player is born in Europe, the tournament in question is the European Championship.

Even outside Europe, it is seen as a prestigious event, sometimes even referred to as ""a World Cup without Brazil and Argentina"".

For the winners, it can be the pinnacle of their careers. Some, however, have won the trophy without playing a single minute. Here, a look at some of the players who did just that...

Kostas Chalkias was in goal for Greece at Euro 2012 and at 38 years of age, the former PAOK, Panathinaikos and Portsmouth shot-stopper was the oldest player in the tournament.

After losing his place due to injury and watching Greece go down to Germany in the quarter-finals from the bench, Chalkias announced his international retirement. Eight years earlier, he was an unused member of the squad which won Euro 2004.

After limited playing time at Bayern Munich, Herbert Zimmermann spent 10 years at FC Köln between 1974 and 1984.

A central defender or a striker, Zimmermann scored in two Euro 1980 qualifiers for West Germany and was called up for the tournament itself, but was an unused player in Italy as Die Mannschaft won the trophy.

Philippe Bergeroo had long spells at Bordeaux, Lille and Toulouse in the 1970s and 1980s and was a back-up goalkeeper for France at two major tournaments.

Bergeroo was part of the France squad which won the Euros in 1984 and was also included as Les Bleus finished third at the 1986 World Cup, but did not feature on either occasion.

Born in Lyon to Portuguese parents, Anthony Lopes came through the youth system at Olympique Lyonnais and went on to play international football for Portugal.

Lopes made his Portugal debut in 2015 and was included in the squad for Euro 2016 by coach Fernando Santos, but he was one of two unused players in France.

Giannis Goumas spent his entire club career at Panathinaikos and won over 40 caps for Greece between 1997 and 2008.

The centre-back was part of the Greece squad which won Euro 2004, but didn't play a single minute in Portugal. He was also included in the roster for Euro 2008, but was an unused player once again.

A defensive midfielder who played for Freiburg, Werder Bremen and VfB Stuttgart in the 1990s and early 2000s, Jens Todt also won several caps for Germany.

Todt was included in the Germany squad at Euro 96, but did not feature for Berti Vogts' side on their run to the continental crown in England.

Sjaak Troost spent his entire career with Feyenoord between 1978 and 1992 and the defender won four caps for the Netherlands in 1987 and 1988.

Part of the Dutch squad which won Euro 88, Troost did not play a single minute as Rinus Michels' men claimed the trophy. He won one Eredivisie title and four Dutch Cups with Feyenoord.

Pepe Reina was part of the Spain squads which won back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012, as well as the World Cup in 2010.

The former Liverpool, Napoli and Lazio goalkeeper featured in a group game against Greece at Euro 2008, but was a non-playing squad member in both 2010 and 2012.

A right winger who played for Panathinaikos, Olympiacos and PAOK, Georgios Georgiadis represented Greece for over a decade between 1953 and 1964.

Georgiadis, who also had a spell at Newcastle United in 1998/99, was part of Greece's squad at Euro 2004 but did not play a game. He made his final international appearance later that year.

Eike Immel represented West Germany in five major tournaments and surprisingly announced his international retirement after Euro 88, missing out on the team's World Cup win in 1990.

Later, he admitted his decision to retire was hasty, but he was part of the West Germany squad which won the European Championships in 1980 - albeit without playing a match.

Albert Rust won Olympic gold with France at Los Angeles 1984 and the former Sochaux goalkeeper was part of the squad which triumphed at Euro 1984, although he didn't play.

Rust also represented France at the 1986 World Cup and his only cap came in the third-place play-off against Belgium, when he helped Les Bleus to a 4-2 win.

Morten Bruun spent his entire career at Silkeborg IF and won 11 caps for the Danish national team between 1990 and 1992.

An unused member of Denmark's Euro 92-winning squad, the former defender had his medal stolen by burglars while commentating on Danish television for a Denmark friendly against Iceland in 2016.

Víctor Valdés' international career was short but productive, with the former Barcelona goalkeeper picking up 20 caps between 2010 and 2014.

More significantly, he also collected two major honours with La Roja. Valdés was back-up to Spain skipper Iker Casillas and did not feature on the pitch for Spain at the 2010 World Cup or in Euro 2012.

Joop Hiele's international career spanned 11 years, but the former Feyenoord goalkeeper won just seven caps for the Netherlands in that time.

Hiele was back-up to Hans van Breukelen at Euro 88 and did not see any playing time in the Dutch side's first major trophy success. He also won an Eredivisie title and two Dutch Cups with Feyenoord.

Pantelis Kakes was one of the best Greek midfielders of his generation and the former PAOK, Olympiacos and AEK Athens player represented his nation between 2001 and 2011.

Kafes was part of Greece's squad in their surprise Euro 2004 triumph, but the midfielder was one of six players unused by coach Otto Rehhagel in Portugal.

Juanfran started his career as a winger but became one of the best right-backs in Spain and the former Atletico Madrid defender was rewarded with 22 caps for La Roja.

After making his full international debut ahead of Euro 2012 in a friendly against Serbia in May, Juanfran was part of the Spain squad which retained the trophy, but did not make a single appearance in Poland and Ukraine. He played in all four of Spain's games at Euro 2016.

René Schneider picked up a Champions League winners' medal with Borussia Dortmund in 1997, but the defender made just one appearance in the competition that season and was left out of the squad for the final.

Schneider won just one cap for Germany and although he was included in the squad for Euro 96, the centre-back did not get on the pitch in the tournament in England.

A trusty understudy to Peter Schmeichel, Mogens Krogh was included in the Denmark squads for two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup.

Krogh did not make an appearance in any of those and watched from the bench as his team-mates won Euro 92. He did impress with two penalty saves against Mexico in the King Fahd Cup in 1995 after coming off the bench and played in the final as Denmark beat Argentina. That tournament was later rebranded as the Confederations Cup.

Hendrie Krüzen made his debut for the Netherlands in 1987 and was picked by coach Rinus Michels to be part of the squad for Euro 88.

The midfielder did not play a single minute as the Dutch triumphed in West Germany and a move to PSV later that summer did not work out. He won just five caps in total.

Ulrich Ramé was the only member of France's Euro 2000-winning squad who did not get to play in Les Bleus' triumph in Belgium and the Netherlands.

The former Bordeaux goalkeeper was the third-choice shot-stopper behind Fabien Barthez and Bernard Lama. He won 12 caps for France between 1999 and 2003.

Raúl Albiol was the only outfield player who did not get on the pitch for Spain in their 2010 World Cup win and the central defender was unused again at Euro 2012.

The former Valencia and Real Madrid centre-back was in the Spain squad for all three of their tournament victories between 2008 and 2012, though, and did feature in two matches at Euro 2008.

Walter Junghans played for Bayern Munich, Schalke and Hertha Berlin between 1977 and 1994. With the Bavarian giants, the goalkeeper won two Bundesliga titles and was a runner-up in the 1982 European Cup final.

At international level, Junghans represented West Germany at the 1988 Olympic Games. He was also a winner as part of the squad at Euro 1980, but did not play and never did earn a senior cap for his country.

Nikos Dabizas spent seven seasons in English football - five with Newcastle United and two at Leicester City - and the centre-back won 70 caps for Greece.

Troubled by an injury, Dabizas did not make a single appearance as Greece produced one of the biggest shocks in European Championship history by winning Euro 2004 in Portugal. He retired from international football later in the summer.

All of Fernando Llorente's 24 Spain caps came in a golden era for La Roja between 2008 and 2013 and the striker scored seven goals for his country.

The former Athletic Club forward came off the bench to play an important role as Spain beat Portugal at the 2010 World Cup, but he did not get on for a single minute at Euro 2012. He was not in the squad for Euro 2008.

Mario Basler picked up 30 caps for Germany between 1994 and 1998 and the right-sided midfielder was part of the squad which won Euro 96.

Basler was still a Werder Bremen player at the time and went on to join Bayern Munich later in the summer. He did not play a single minute at Euro 96 and never represented his country in a major tournament again.

Eduardo Carvalho won 36 caps for Portugal between 2009 and 2016 and was the starter for his national team at the 2010 World Cup.

Back-up in 2016, Eduardo did not play as Portugal won the European Championship, with Rui Patrício the starter in France. The former Braga goalkeeper retired from international football after playing in a 5-0 win over Gibraltar in September 2006.

Rainer Bonhof is the only player to have won two European Championship titles without playing in either tournament.

A youngster in 1972, he was unused in West Germany's Euro-winning campaign that summer. Two years later, the legendary Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder became his nation's youngest World Cup winner and set up Gerd Muller for the winning goal in the final. In 1980, he was injured and did not feature as West Germany won the Euros again. He did play in 1976, though, as Die Mannschaft lost in the final to Czechoslovakia on penalties.

Johnny Mølby played as a midfielder for the likes of Nantes, Borussia Monchengladbach and Mechelen in the 1990s and won 16 caps for Denmark.

The cousin of former Liverpool favourite Jan Mølby, Johnny was part of the Danish squad which won Euro 88, but he didn't make an appearance in the tournament in Sweden.

Alex Meret was Italy's third-choice goalkeeper at Euro 2020 and the Napoli shot-stopper was the only unused player in the Azzurri squad which won the tournament.

While Salvatore Sirigu was a late replacement for Gianluigi Donnarumma in the goup game against Wales, Meret did not get on the pitch at all during the tournament, but still picked up a winners' medal at Wembley as Italy beat England on penalties.

Aron Winter won 84 caps for the Netherlands between 1987 and 2000 and the midfielder played for Ajax, Lazio and Inter in a successful career.

Winter went to four European Championships with the Dutch national team and featured in three, but was an unused player as the Oranje won the trophy in 1988.

Oliver Kahn won 86 caps for Germany between 1995 and 2006 in a legendary career and the Bayern Munich goalkeeper was one of the world's best at his peak.

Kahn received the Golden Ball for the World Cup's best player in 2002, but was behind Andreas Köpke earlier in his career and did not make an appearance as Germany triumphed at Euro 96.

Andrés Palop was Spain's third-choice goalkeeper at Euro 2008 and part of the squad which won the tournament, ending a 44-year trophy drought for La Roja.

Unusually, the former Sevilla and Valencia goalkeeper won a major honour for his country, but never did win a cap for Spain as he was always used as a back-up option.",fourfourtwo.com,news,fourfourtwo.com,Ben Hayward,0.2705882352941176,454399816,28,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GsT7aSfpEeGLtCvHZPESgJ-1200-80.jpg,

Being a good player is certainly no guarantee of becoming a good manager, but the majority of this list have done fairly well for themselves in the dugout.

We've gone back to Euro 2008 and have found 13 players from that tournament who have since become managers.

The dream of doing an unbeaten treble is now over, following Bayer Leverkusen's loss in the Europa League final, but what a job Alonso has done.

He took over the Bundesliga club when they were languishing in the relegation zone and in just 18 months, he took them to the league title - going unbeaten in 51 games in the process.

""Our team has written itself into Bundesliga history,"" Alonso said after lifting the Bundesliga. ""In 20 years we will look back and all be able to say: 'Wow, we were there'.

""We will never forget this day. It is totally deserved.""

Part of the Italy squad from 2008, De Rossi has made a name for himself in management this year. Taking the reins from Jose Mourinho was never going to be easy, but the legendary midfielder has had a brilliant impact since returning to Roma.

He inherited the squad when they were languishing ninth in the league and has since taken them up to sixth and into a European place for next season. That's not too shabby.

The Spanish midfielder cut his teeth as a manager in Qatar for a couple of years before landing the Barcelona job in 2021.

Since that point, it's been a wild ride for the 44-year-old. He guided Barcelona to the La Liga title last year, but following some drama behind the scenes, it seems like his time at Camp Nou is now up.

Barcelona have reportedly been meeting with new managerial candidates in recent weeks which likely spells the end for Xavi at his boyhood club.

Since hanging up his boots in 2018, Kuyt has had a number of coaching roles and now finds himself as the manager of Belgian outfit Beerschot.

He's done a fine job since taking over in December too, winning the Challenger Pro League which is the second tier of Belgian football.

It seems a bit mental that Nuno was still kicking it in 2008, but here we are. He was part of the Portugal squad that made it to the quarter-finals, but he didn't play a single minute of the competition.

Fast forward to 2024 and he's now on his seventh managerial job. Following stints with the likes of Porto, Wolves, Spurs and Al-Ittihad, you'll now find him at Nottingham Forest.

TRY A QUIZ: Can you name every England player to score at the European Championship?

The former Dutch international has managed over 100 games in his managerial career so far, but currently finds himself without a job.

He spent one year as PSV boss and arguably laid the foundations for Peter Bosz's side to win the Eredivisie this season. Fingers crossed we see Van Nistelrooy back in the dugout soon.

The Juventus job arguably came too soon in Pirlo's managerial career, but he's since built his reputation back up with Fatih Karagumruk and now Sampdoria.

Pirlo guided Sampdoria to the Serie B playoffs this season, but his side ultimately lost to Palermo in the preliminary round.

Kovac announced his retirement not long after Euro 2008 and the former Croatian midfielder has had plenty of managerial jobs since then.

He's perhaps most known for his stint with Bayern Munich, but also managed the likes of Monaco, Eintracht Frankfurt and Wolfsburg in recent years.

To be fair to Kovac, he did sign a few gems during his time at the Allianz Arena.

The French midfielder landed his first managerial job in 2016 when he took over MLS side New York City FC. He's since had spells with Nice and Crystal Palace and now works as the Strasbourg manager.

""I didn't want to be a manager based on career I had,"" Vieira said last year when discussing his route into management.

""I wanted for people to make a judgment on me as a manager, so it was important to build myself to have this kind of credibility and experience to be where I am today, and for people to judge me on what I've been doing in the last couple of years and not my playing career.""

The former Dutch star has been out of work since being sacked by Rangers in 2022, but by all accounts, he's looking to get back into management soon.

""I'm quite relaxed and I'm having a great time. I'm very happy with the way my life is now, but I'm also excited to start again,"" Van Bronckhorst told reporters in April.

""Hopefully that will be next season. I'm starting to get that itch to be involved in football management again.

""I love the dynamics of being a trainer. But I admit I am picky and my feeling at a club must be good.""

An underrated player from his playing days, the former Italian midfielder is now in charge of Pisa SC. In his debut season at the club, he's managed to guide them to mid-table in Serie B.

Perhaps more known for his punditry these days, Henry is still active in the managerial game. Following stints with Monaco and Montreal Impact, he currently works as the France U23 manager.

There's rarely a dull moment when Gattuso is around. Even in his post-playing days, his passion for the game is still as rife as ever.

He did a fairly good job with Napoli to be fair, but the less said about his time with Valencia and Marseille, the better.",planetfootball.com,news,Planet Football,Ben Stewart,0.1058823529411765,454241095,1,https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd3nfwcxd527z59.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F05%2F23101607%2FEuro-2008-managers.jpg,

Gian Piero Gasperini's side earned a 3-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin to secure their first major trophy since 1963 and a spot in Europe's elite club competition next season. Former Leicester and Everton forward Ademola Lookman scored a fine hat-trick on the night.

Italy and Germany had already been guaranteed a fifth Champions League spot due to their superior coefficient rating. That means Tottenham, who finished outside the top four in the Premier League, will play in the Europa League rather than in the highest tier of European football.

However, Atalanta's win is set to give Italy a mammoth SIX places in the Champions League if they remain in fifth spot in the Serie A table. Roma, who are guaranteed to finish sixth, would jump into the Champions League as the fifth league qualifier.

If Atalanta leapfrog Bologna or Juventus on the final day of the season into third or fourth, Roma would participate in the Europa League. Should Roma secure a Champions League place, though, would see them move into the top seeding block as they have a higher five-year coefficient score than Barcelona. Arsenal are set to compete in the second seeding block alongside the likes of Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen and Atletico Madrid.

From the 2024/25 season, the Champions League is set to be expanded from 32 to 36 teams. Under the new league-style competition rules, every team will play two clubs from the four seeding pots. Clubs cannot play sides from the same country, meaning Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool and Aston Villa are not able to face each other.

The seeding pots are now directly determined by coefficients, compared to the previous system which saw the Europa League winners and the champions of the top six divisions of European football in the first tier. That means Arsenal and Aston Villa are facing nightmare draws.

In the worst-case scenario, the Gunners might have to face Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain from Pot 1 and Barcelona and Juventus from Pot 2 should they drop into the third seeding third. Every team will play eight matches in the group-stage phase, which is not set to be completed until January.

The top eight in the 'final' league table are set to qualify for the last 16, with teams placed ninth to 24th set to fight it out for the right to join them in the seeded draw. That means the losing eight sides would get eliminated, alongside teams placed 25th to 36th, to exit the competition.

Gian Piero Gasperini's side earned a 3-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin to secure their first major trophy since 1963 and a spot in Europe's elite club competition next season. Former Leicester and Everton forward Ademola Lookman scored a fine hat-trick on the night.

Italy and Germany had already been guaranteed a fifth Champions League spot due to their superior coefficient rating. That means Tottenham, who finished outside the top four in the Premier League, will play in the Europa League rather than in the highest tier of European football.

However, Atalanta's win is set to give Italy a mammoth SIX places in the Champions League if they remain in fifth spot in the Serie A table. Roma, who are guaranteed to finish sixth, would jump into the Champions League as the fifth league qualifier.

If Atalanta leapfrog Bologna or Juventus on the final day of the season into third or fourth, Roma would participate in the Europa League. Should Roma secure a Champions League place, though, would see them move into the top seeding block as they have a higher five-year coefficient score than Barcelona. Arsenal are set to compete in the second seeding block alongside the likes of Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen and Atletico Madrid.

From the 2024/25 season, the Champions League is set to be expanded from 32 to 36 teams. Under the new league-style competition rules, every team will play two clubs from the four seeding pots. Clubs cannot play sides from the same country, meaning Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool and Aston Villa are not able to face each other.

The seeding pots are now directly determined by coefficients, compared to the previous system which saw the Europa League winners and the champions of the top six divisions of European football in the first tier. That means Arsenal and Aston Villa are facing nightmare draws.

In the worst-case scenario, the Gunners might have to face Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain from Pot 1 and Barcelona and Juventus from Pot 2 should they drop into the third seeding third. Every team will play eight matches in the group-stage phase, which is not set to be completed until January.

The top eight in the 'final' league table are set to qualify for the last 16, with teams placed ninth to 24th set to fight it out for the right to join them in the seeded draw. That means the losing eight sides would get eliminated, alongside teams placed 25th to 36th, to exit the competition.

Arsenal potential Champions League group: Bayern Munich, PSG, Barcelona, Juventus, ARSENAL, PSV, Fenerbahce, Sturm Graz

The 34-year-old announced earlier this week that he will be leaving Los Blancos and retiring from football after representing Germany at Euro 2024 this summer.

Kroos, widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, has spent the last 10 seasons at Real Madrid, making over 460 appearances and winning a total of 22 trophies.

The 108-cap Germany international helped Carlo Ancelotti's side win the La Liga title this season and is hoping to end his time at the club on a high by lifting his fifth Champions League trophy when they lock horns with Borussia Dortmund in the final on June 3.

With his contract expiring in the summer, Kroos believes now is the right time to hang up his boots, forcing Real Madrid to delve into the transfer market for a replacement.

Kimmich, Barella, Veerman on Real Madrid's radar

According to FootballTransfers, Real Madrid have identified Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich, Inter Milan's Nicolo Barella and PSV Eindhoven's Joey Veerman as three potential midfielders to replace Kroos this summer.

Kimmich has been tipped to seek pastures new this summer after spending almost a decade at Bayern Munich, making 390 appearances and winning 20 trophies, including eight Bundesliga titles.

The versatile 29-year-old, who can play in midfield or at right-back, will soon be entering the final 12 months of his contract and has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs including Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal.

A potential move to the English top flight has also been mooted for Inter star Barella, who was a key figure in the Nerazzurri side that has cruised to the Serie A title this season - currently sitting 19 points clear at the summit with one game remaining.

The box-to-box midfielder has made 234 appearances in all competitions for Inter over the last five seasons, and Real Madrid could face complications with persuading the Italy international to leave San Siro as he is allegedly planning to extend his contract beyond 2026.

Veerman's rise alerts Real Madrid

Meanwhile, PSV midfielder Veerman has elevated his game to new heights since joining the club from Heerenveen in 2022 and has particularly excelled in the 2023-24 campaign.

Indeed, the 25-year-old has scored five goals and provided an Eredivisie-high 16 assists in 29 league appearances and has been a key player in the club's title-winning season.

Veerman has been called up to the Netherlands' provisional squad for Euro 2024, and manager Ronald Koeman has stated that he would like to see the midfielder play at a higher level.

""I think he is so good for the Netherlands,"" Koeman said on Dutch podcast Veronica Offside. ""I would like to see him in midfield in Spain, Italy, Germany or England. That is the highest level in terms of everything. I think he is ready in many respects for a move abroad.""

PSV will be keen to keep hold of Veerman, who still has over two years remaining on his contract at Philips Stadion.

A total of 24 teams will compete for European Championship glory in Germany, with several sides having revealed either their provisional squads or indeed their final list of 26 players.

Amongst them are pre-tournament favourites England, with the likes of Adam Wharton, Jarell Quansah and Curtis Jones joining the more established talent in their 33-man provisional squad.

The biggest threats to Gareth Southgate's hopes of becoming just the second England men's manager to win a major trophy come from France, Germany, Spain and Portugal, whilst tournament dark horses such as Netherlands, Croatia and Denmark will all fancy deep runs to the latter stages of the competition.

Scotland, meanwhile, are competing in back-to-back European Championships as Steve Clarke looks to guide his side into the knockout stages of a major competition for the first time in their history.

Here is your full team-by-team guide to every country taking part at Euro 2024.

Albania, managed by former Arsenal and Manchester City player Sylvinho, topped their qualifying group ahead of the likes of Czechia and Poland to qualify for just their second-ever major tournament.

Euro 2016 saw Albania fail to advance from the group, but the Balkan country did finish the tournament on a high with a 1-0 win over Romania in their final game.

Austria finished second in qualifying under former Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick, but they look set to be without their captain and Real Madrid star David Alaba, who has missed the second part of the season with a ruptured ACL.

Their Round of 16 appearance at Euro 2020 was the furthest they have ever progressed in the competition, suffering an extra-time defeat to eventual champions Italy at Wembley.

The Red Devils made light work of qualifying under their new Italian-German manager Domenico Tedesco to seal their place at their third consecutive Euros.

Quarter-finalists in the previous two editions, Belgium will be hoping for a deeper run this time around, with a squad which is perhaps lacking some of the stardust of their golden generation in recent years but one which still possesses extreme quality - as well as a number of exciting youngsters.

Goalkeepers: Dominik Livakovic (Fenerbahce), Nediljko Labrovic (Rijeka), Ivica Ivusic (Pafos)

Defenders: Josip Stanisic (Bayer Leverkusen), Marin Pongracic (Lecce), Josko Gvardiol (Manchester City), Martin Erlic (Sassuolo), Borna Sosa (Ajax), Domagoj Vida (AEK Athens), Josip Juranovic (Union Berlin), Josip Sutalo (Ajax)

Midfielders: Lovro Majer (Wolfsburg), Mateo Kovacic (Manchester City), Luka Modric (Real Madrid), Marcelo Brozovic (Al-Nassr), Nikola Vlasic (Torino), Mario Pasalic (Atalanta), Luka Ivanusec (Feyenoord), Luka Sucic (Salzburg), Martin Baturina (Dinamo Zagreb)

Forwards: Ivan Perisic (Hajduk Split), Andrej Kramaric (Hoffenheim), Bruno Petkovic (Dinamo Zagreb), Marko Pjaca (Rijeka), Ante Budimir (Osasuna), Marco Pasalic (Rijeka)

Perennially the tournament dark horses, Croatia will be desperate to finally claim their first-ever major trophy having finished as runners-up at the 2018 World Cup and in the 2023 Nations League, as well as a third-place finish at the last World Cup in Qatar.

Captain Luka Modric will be featuring in his ninth major international tournament, with a number of his veteran teammates also likely to be playing in their swansong competition.

Czechia (Czech Republic) booked their ticket to their eighth successive European Championship with a runners-up finish in Group E.

Their squad includes West Ham stars Tomáš Souček and Vladimír Coufal, as well as promising Bayer Leverkusen youngster Adam Hložek.

Denmark, who were beaten by England in the semi-finals of Euro 2020, qualified for this year's edition as Group H winners.

The Danes pulled off one of the biggest shocks in football history when they won Euro 92, having only qualified after Yugoslavia was disqualified because of an outbreak of war following the break-up of the country.

Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal), James Trafford (Burnley)

Defenders: Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Lewis Dunk (Brighton), Joe Gomez (Liverpool), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Jarell Quansah (Liverpool), Luke Shaw (Man Utd), John Stones (Man City), Kieran Trippier (Newcastle), Kyle Walker (Man City)

Qualification was never really in doubt for England, who completed the double over Italy and picked up four points against Ukraine.

Despite an underwhelming March international break, and injury concerns hanging over numerous members of their squad, England should make relatively light work of their group with Italy, France and Spain potentially awaiting on their side of the draw later in the competition.

France and their star-studded squad start the tournament as second favourites behind England and are looking to win their first European Championship since 2000.

Les Blues were beaten finalists in their home tournament in 2016, but recovered from the disappointment to win the the World Cup two years later.

Georgia finished fourth in qualifying, but their performances in the Nations League saw them granted a play-off berth.

The Black Sea country secured their spot at their first ever major tournament as an independent nation with a penalty shootout win over Greece. Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia will undoubtedly be one of the players to watch at Euro 2024.

Goalkeepers: Oliver Baumann (Hoffenheim), Alex Nubel (Stuttgart), Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich), Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona)

Defenders: Waldemar Anton (Stuttgart), Benjamin Henrichs (RB Leipzig), Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich), Robin Koch (Eintracht Frankfurt), Maximilian Mittelstadt (Stuttgart), David Raum (RB Leipzig), Antonio Rudiger (Real Madrid), Nico Schlotterbeck (Borussia Dortmund), Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)

Forwards: Maximilian Beier (Hoffenheim), Niclas Fullkrug (Borussia Dortmund), Kai Havertz (Arsenal), Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich), Deniz Undav (Stuttgart)

Germany, who qualified automatically as hosts, parted company with former manager Hansi Flick in September 2023 after just four wins in 17 matches.

Results have still been mixed under Julian Nagelsamnn, who is in charge until the end of the tournament, but they still possess the quality to win their first European Championship for 28 years.

Goalkeepers: Denes Dibusz (Ferencvaros), Peter Gulacsi (RB Leipzig), Peter Szappanos (Paks)

Defenders: Botond Balogh (Parma), Endre Botka (Ferencvaros), Marton Dardai (Hertha BSC), Attila Fiola (Fehervar), Adam Lang (Omonia Nicosia), Willi Orban (RB Leipzig), Attila Szalai (Freiburg)

Midfielders: Bendeguz Bolla (Servette), Mihaly Kata (MTK), Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth), Laszlo Kleinheisler (Hajduk Split), Adam Nagy (Spezia Calcio), Zsolt Nagy (Puskas Akademia), Loic Nego (Le Havre), Andras Schafer (Union Berlin), Callum Styles (Sunderland)

Forwards: Martin Adam (Ulsan Hyundai), Kevin Csoboth (Ujpest), Daniel Gazdag (Philadelphia Union), Krisztofer Horvath (Kecskemet), Roland Sallai (Freiburg), Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool), Barnabas Varga (Ferencvaros)

Having gone 44 years without qualifying for the Euros, Hungary have now made it to their third tournament in succession and boast Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai amongst their ranks.

Hungary gave a decent account of themselves at Euro 2020, registering two draws in a group consisting of France, Germany and Portugal, but that ultimately wasn't enough to stop them finishing bottom of the pile.

Italy are the defending champions having beaten England in the final on penalties three years ago but will face a fight to qualify for the knockouts with Spain and Croatia also in Group B.

The Azzurri, who saw Roberto Mancini resign halfway through the qualifying campaign, finished as runners-up to the Three Lions, securing their spot at Euro 2024 with a draw against Ukraine on the final matchday.

Goalkeepers: Justin Bijlow (Feyenoord), Mark Flekken (Brentford), Bart Verbruggen (Brighton & Hove Albion), Nick Olij (Sparta Rotterdam)

Defenders: Nathan Ake (Manchester City), Daley Blind (Girona FC), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool), Denzel Dumfries (Inter Milan), Jeremie Frimpong (Bayer Leverkusen), Lutsharel Geertruida (Feyenoord), Matthijs de Ligt (Bayern Munich), Ian Maatsen (Borussia Dortmund), Micky van de Ven (Tottenham Hotspur), Stefan de Vrij (Inter Milan)

Midfielders: Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool), Frenkie de Jong (FC Barcelona), Teun Koopmeiners (Atalanta), Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan), Marten de Roon (Atalanta), Jerdy Schouten (PSV Eindhoven), Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig), Quinten Timber (Feyenoord), Joey Veerman (PSV Eindhoven), Georginio Wijnaldum (Al Ettifaq)

Forwards: Steven Bergwijn (Ajax), Brian Brobbey (Ajax), Memphis Depay (Atletico Madrid), Cody Gakpo (Liverpool), Donyell Malen (Borussia Dortmund), Wout Weghorst (Hoffenheim)

The Dutch finished second behind France in qualifying and they will pose a real danger in Germany, with their squad packed full of immense talent with the likes of Virgil Van Dijk, Frenkie de Jong and Xavi Simons.

Ronald Koeman is in his second spell in charge, having won the tournament as a player back in 1988 - their sole major honour to date.

Poland could only manage a distant third to Albania and Czechia in qualifying, and as such they had to settle for a spot in the play-offs to keep their Euro 2024 hopes alive.

Having dispatched Estonia 5-1 in the play-off semi-final, the Poles edged out Wales on penalties following a 0-0 draw after extra-time to qualify for their fifth consecutive major tournament.

Portugal were the only team to finish qualifying with a perfect record, winning all ten of their games with 36 goals scored and just two conceded in the process.

Now managed by former Belgium manager Roberto Martinez, Portugal will be hoping for a fairytale send-off for Cristiano Ronaldo, who will be playing in his 11th - and surely last - major international tournament.

Defenders: Antonio Silva (Benfica), Danilo Pereira (Paris St Germain), Diogo Dalot (Man Utd), Goncalo Inacio (Sporting), Joao Cancelo (Barcelona), Nelson Semedo (Wolves), Nuno Mendes (PSG), Pepe (Porto), Ruben Dias (Man City)

Midfielders: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United), Joao Neves (Benfica), Joao Palhinha (Fulham), Otavio Monteiro (Al Nassr), Ruben Neves (Al-Hilal), Vitinha (PSG)

Forwards: Bernardo Silva (Man City), Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr), Diogo Jota (Liverpool), Francisco Conceicao (Porto), Goncalo Ramos (PSG), Joao Felix (Barcelona), Pedro Neto (Wolves), Rafael Leao (AC Milan)

Romania topped Group I in qualifying to reach their first tournament since 2016 and their sixth in European Championship history.

Their heroics at Euro 2000 saw them make it out of a group consisting of England, Germany and Portugal before being beaten by Italy in the last eight.

Goalkeepers: Zander Clark (Hearts), Craig Gordon (Hearts), Angus Gunn (Norwich), Liam Kelly (Motherwell)

Defenders: Liam Cooper (Leeds United), Grant Hanley (Norwich), Jack Hendry (Al-Ettifaq), Ross McCrorie (Bristol City), Scott McKenna (Copenhagen), Ryan Porteous (Watford), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Greg Taylor (Celtic), Kieran Tierney (Real Sociedad)

Midfielders: Stuart Armstrong (Southampton), Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Brighton), Ryan Jack (Rangers), Kenny McLean (Norwich), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Callum McGregor (Celtic), Scott McTominay (Manchester United)

Forwards: Che Adams (Southampton), Ben Doak (Liverpool), Lyndon Dykes (Queens Park Rangers), James Forrest (Celtic), Lawrence Shankland (Hearts)

Steve Clark guided Scotland to second place in their qualifying group to make it back-to-back European Championship appearances, and their latest Euro adventure sees them kick-off against Germany in the opening fixture.

Scotland, who will have to make do without the impressive Bologna midfielder Lewis Ferguson due to injury, have never qualified from their group at a major tournament and their attempts to put their sorry record to bed will most likely be determined by the crunch clashes against Switzerland and Hungary.

Goalkeepers: Vanja Milinkovic Savic (Turin), Predrag Rajkovic (Majorca), Dorde Petrovic (Chelsea), Aleksandar Jovanovic (Partizan)

Defenders: Strahinja Pavlovic (RB Salzburg), Nikola Milenkovic (Fiorentina), Milos Veljkovic (Werder Bremen), Srdan Babic (Spartak Moscow), Uros Spajic (Red Star), Strahinja Erakovic (Zenit), Nemanja Stojic (TSC), Jan Karlo Simic (Milan)

Midfielders: Sasa Lukic (Fulham), Nemanja Gudelj (Seville), Nemanja Maksimovic (Getafe), Ivan Ilic (Torino), Sasa Zdjelar (CSKA Moscow), Srdjan Mijailovic (Red Star), Sergej Milinkovic Savic (Al Hilal), Dusan Tadic (Fenerbahce), Samed Bazdar (Partizan), Aleksandar Cirkovic (TSC), Lazar Samardzic (Udinese), Veljko Birmancevic (Sparta Prague), Filip Kostic (Juventus), Filip Mladenovic (Panathinaikos), Matija Gluscevic (Radnički 1923), Andrija Zivkovic (PAOK), Mijat Gacinovic (AEK), Nemanja Radonjic (Majorca)

Forwards: Aleksandar Mitrovic (Al Hilal), Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus), Luka Jovic (Milan), Petar Ratkov (RB Salzburg), Mihailo Ivanovic (Vojvodina)

Remarkably, Serbia will be competing in their first European Championship since 2000, despite having participated in four World Cups in the meantime.

Serbia were runners-up in the competition in 1960 and 1968, when they competed as part of Yugoslavia, and this generation of team is packed full of talent such as Dušan Vlahović, Sergej Milinković-Savić and former Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrović.

Slovakia finished a distant second behind Portugal in qualifying, with manager Francesco Calzona combining his role with the national team whilst also being the manager of Napoli in his native Italy.

Slovakia claimed the trophy as part of Czechoslovakia in 1976, with their best performance since splitting with Czechia seeing them reach the Round of 16 eight years ago, where they were beaten by Germany.

Slovenia were only beaten twice in qualifying as they finished as group runners-up, with Euro 2024 the first major tournament they will contest since the 2010 World Cup.

England will have to keep a close eye on RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko when they meet in their group fixture on June 25, with the 20 year-old regarded as one of the hottest young strikers on the continent and having been linked with some of Europe's biggest clubs.

Only Germany have taken part in more European Championships than Spain, who secured their berth at their 12th Euros having finished first in their group with seven wins from eight games in qualifying.

Luis de la Fuente, who was appointed in 2022 to replace Luis Enrique after Spain were knocked out in the World Cup Round of 16, will be hoping to guide his country to a record-breaking fourth Euros title.

Euro 2024 will see Switzerland participate in their fifth finals in the last six editions.

The Swiss produced a timeless performance to knock France out of Euro 2020 on penalties, before succumbing to spot kicks against Spain in the quarter-finals.

Vincenzo Montella's men, featuring the likes of Inter's Hakan Çalhanoğlu and Real Madrid wonderkid Arda Güler, finished ahead of Croatia and Wales to finish Group D as winners.

Turkey have been knocked out in the group stage in their last two tournaments but famously made it all the way to the semi-finals in 2008, only to be beaten 3-2 by Germany in one of the all-time classic Euro games.

Goalkeepers: Andriy Lunin (Real Madrid), Anatoliy Trubin (Benfica), Heorhiy Bushchan (Dynamo Kyiv)

Defenders: Yukhym Konoplia, Valeriy Bondar, Mykola Matvienko (all Shakhtar Donetsk), Oleksandr Tymchyk (Dynamo Kyiv), Vitaliy Mykolenko (Everton), Maksym Taloverov (LASK), Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth), Oleksandr Svatok (Dnipro-1)

Forwards: Artem Dovbyk (Girona), Roman Yaremchuk (Valencia), Vladyslav Vanat (Dynamo Kyiv)

Having narrowly missed out on automatic qualification on goal difference to Italy, Ukraine produced two stirring comebacks against Bosnia and Iceland in the play-offs, with Chelsea's Mykhailo Mudryk scoring an 84th minute winner against the latter.

Ukraine will be confident of reaching the knockout stages at Euro 2024 in what will be their first appearance at a major international tournament since the Russian invasion in 2022.

With most domestic leagues across Europe now in the rear-view mirror, at least for now, attention has swiftly turned to this summer's Euro 2024 extravaganza in Germany.

The month-long tournament officially gets underway on June 14 when Scotland take on the host nation, but there are plenty of landmarks ahead of that date.

One of the most anticipated of those pre-tournament landmarks is always the squad announcement for each nation, and managers have begun naming their preliminary selections with a matter of weeks to go until things get underway.

The likes of England, France, Germany, Netherlands and more have all confirmed their initial squads, with some opting for larger rosters which they can whittle down and others choosing to stick with a smaller core group.

The final 26-man tournament squads for each nation must be announced by June 7, just one week before the on-field matters get underway in earnest.

Here, Sports Mole rounds up every nation's squad for Euro 2024.

(Image credit: Getty Images)

Brazil has exported more footballers to Europe than any other country in the world.

With a population of over 200 million and a huge passion for football, Brazil has produced some of the game's greatest-ever players.

The nation's biggest football icon, Pelé, did not play in Europe. O Rei spent most of his career with Santos, before finishing up with the New York Cosmos in the early 1970s.

Back then, South American clubs did not need to sell their stars to European clubs. But it has been a different story since, with almost all the top talents playing in the ""Old continent"" at some stage in more recent times.

Here, a look at some of the Brazilian players who made their mark on European football...

Rodrygo joined Real Madrid from Santos in 2019 and the Brazilian forward quickly became an important player for the Spanish giants.

The winger has already accumulated a number of La Liga titles and international trophies for Los Blancos, chipping in with some big goals along the way. He made his Brazil debut in 2019.

Giovane Elber spent virtually his entire career in Europe after being snapped up by AC Milan as a youth player - but he never featured for the Rossoneri.

After three years at Grasshoppers in Switzerland, Elber spent three more at VfB Stuttgart, but his most memorable moments came at Bayern Munich as he won four Bundesliga titles and a Champions League crown with the Bavarian giants. Later, he also won a Ligue 1 title with Lyon. He finished his career with Cruzeiro in Brazil and over 270 goals overall, but just 15 caps for his country.

Maicon was one of the best right-backs in the world at his peak and was even keeping Dani Alves out of the Brazil team for a fair while.

In a seven-year spell at Inter, Maicon won 11 trophies, including four Serie A titles and the treble in 2009/10. He also played for Monaco, Roma and briefly for Manchester City.

Lucio earned over 100 caps for Brazil between 2000 and 2011 and was part of the team which won the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.

A Champions League finalist with Bayer Leverkusen earlier that year, the centre-back went on to win three Bundesliga titles at Bayern Munich and was part of the Inter side which claimed a treble under Jose Mourinho in 2009/10.

Juninho was part of Brazil's World Cup-winning squad in 2002 and won close to 50 caps for his country between 1995 and 2003.

The diminutive playmaker is a hero in Middlesbrough, where he played across three spells and starred in the club's first-ever trophy: the League Cup in 2004. He also spent two seasons at Atletico Madrid between 1997 and 1999 and had a spell at Celtic before returning to Brazil in 2005.

Toninho Cerezo is considered one of Brazil's best-ever defensive midfielders and he won over 50 caps for his country between 1977 and 1986.

Cerezo spent nine years in Italy with Roma and Sampdoria, winning four Coppa Italia crowns and a Serie A title. He was also on the losing side in European Cup finals with both clubs (for Roma against Liverpool in 1984 and for Sampdoria versus Barcelona in 1992).

Eder Militao moved to Real Madrid in 2019 after a single season at Porto and became a regular after the departure of club legends Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane.

The centre-back, who made his Brazil debut in 2018 and won the Copa America the following year, has already won an array of silverware with Madrid and was given a €1 billion release clause after signing a new contract in January 2024.

Best remembered for his time at Atletico Madrid, where he made over 300 appearances across two four-year spells, Filipe Luis was a no-nonsense left-back who won 44 caps for Brazil between 2009 and 2019.

Filipe won La Liga, a Copa del Rey, two Europa Leagues and two UEFA Super Cups at Atleti, as well as featuring in two Champions League finals for the Rojiblancos. He also had spells at Deportivo La Coruña and Chelsea and after returning to Brazil in 2019, won the Copa Libertadores twice with Flamengo.

Fernandinho spent nine years at Manchester City between 2013 and 2022 and won five Premier League titles, six League Cups and an FA Cup with the Sky Blues. He was also a Champions League finalist in 2021.

The defensive midfielder previously spent eight seasons at Shakhtar Donetsk, winning a series of trophies in Ukraine. Capped over 50 times by Brazil, he returned to his homeland with Athletico Paranaense in 2022.

It took Pep Guardiola a while to find his ideal goalkeeper after moving to Manchester City in 2016, but Ederson's arrival from Benfica the following year solved that particular problem.

With his impressive distribution, the Brazilian is the perfect player for Guardiola's style of play at City and despite being behind Alisson Becker at international level, he is considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world.

Adriano was one of the world's best strikers for a period in the mid-2000s and a formidable talent in the Brazil teams which won the Copa America in 2004 and the Confederations Cup a year later.

Best remembered for his time at Inter, Adriano won two Serie A titles and was a prolific scorer with the Nerazzurri between 2003 and 2006. But he fell into decline due to depression and struggles with alcohol after the death of his father and made his last Brazil appearance at the age of just 28.

One of the finest free-kick takers in football history, Juninho Pernambucano was a fixture in all seven of Lyon's Ligue 1 titles between 2001 and 2008.

Capped 40 times by Brazil, the midfielder was unfortunate with injuries and missed both the 2002 World Cup and the 2004 Copa America wins. He retired from international duty after the 2006 World Cup.

Mauro Silva earned 59 caps for Brazil between 1991 and 2001, starting alongside Dunga in midfield as the South Americans won the World Cup in 2004.

After spells at Guarani and Bragantino in his homeland, the tough-tackling midfielder moved to Deportivo La Coruña in 1992 and stayed with the Galician club for 13 seasons. A fixture in Depor's greatest-ever era, the Brazilian won La Liga, two Copas del Rey and three Supercopas during his time at Riazor.

Aldair played in back-to-back World Cup finals for Brazil, winning the trophy in 1994 and finishing as a runner-up four years later. He was also a Copa America winner in 1989 and 1997.

At club level, the central defender made over 400 appearances for Roma in 13 seasons at the Stadio Olimpico and was a Serie A winner in 2000/01. Either side of his time in the Italian capital, he also had short spells at Benfica and Genoa.

Alisson Becker joined Liverpool from Roma in the summer of 2018 and quickly improved the Reds as Jurgen Klopp's side went on to win the Champions League the following season and the Premier League the year after that.

A Copa America winner with Brazil in 2019, Alisson was named Best Goalkeeper in the World for that year by IFFHS (International Federation of Football History & Statistics) and has often been described as the world's finest by Klopp.

Falcao spent five seasons at Roma in the early 1980s and helped the Giallorossi win the Serie A title and two Coppa Italia crowns in his time in the Italian capital.

After leading Roma to the Scudetto in 1982/83, he was nicknamed ""the eighth king of Rome"", but his relationship with the club deteriorated after the European Cup final loss to Liverpool in 1984, when he refused to take a penalty in the shootout. These days, though, he is considered a legend at the Italian club. Falcao played for Brazil in two World Cups in a 10-year international career.

Thiago Silva was 24 years old when he signed for AC Milan from Fluminense in 2009, but the Brazilian defender went on to spend 15 seasons at the highest level in Europe.

After three years at Milan and a Scudetto in 2010/11, Silva won plenty of silverware in eight campaigns at Paris Saint-Germain and helped Chelsea claim the Champions League following his move to London in 2020. Capped over 100 times by Brazil, he won the Copa America in 2019.

Jose Altafini was an Italian-Brazilian footballer who began his career in Brazil with Palmeiras and represented the South Americans at the 1958 World Cup, before embarking on a long career in Italy.

Atalfini, who had played under the name of Mazzola in Brazil due to his likeness to Italian legend Valentino Mazzola, scored over 200 goals in Serie A for Napoli, AC Milan and Juventus over a period of 18 years. He also played for Italy at the 1962 World Cup and finished his career in Switzerland.

Casemiro formed a memorable midfield three with Luka Modric and Toni Kroos at Real Madrid and the Brazilian was part of five Champions League wins with Los Blancos.

The defensive midfielder was considered one of the world's best and also chipped in with important goals, including one in the 2017 Champions League final against Juventus. After nine years at Madrid (with one season spent at Porto in 2014/15), Casemiro joined Manchester United in 2022.

Careca was part of Napoli's special side in the late 1980s and early 1990s alongside legendary Argentina attacker Diego Maradona.

The Brazilian striker signed for Napoli in 1987, after the club's first Serie A title, and helped the Blues win the UEFA Cup in 1989 and another Scudetto the following year. Against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup final, he scored three of Napoli's four goals across two legs and netted close to 100 in six seasons at the club.

One of Brazil's best-ever strikers, Bebeto starred alongside Romario in the South Americans' 1994 World Cup win and also in their Copa America triumph in 1989.

In four seasons at Deportivo La Coruña, Bebeto scored over 100 goals and helped the Galicians win a Copa del Rey and a Supercopa. He is remembered as one of the club's best-ever players and was La Liga top scorer in 1992/93.

Vinicius Junior joined Real Madrid from Flamengo in 2018 and the Brazilian was initially mocked by rival fans for his wayward finishing.

But the attacker, also targeted with horrific racial abuse during his time in Spain, went on to become a star at the Santiago Bernabeu with a series of dazzling displays, and scored the winner in the 2022 Champions League final against Liverpool.

Romario scored 128 goals in 149 games in a wonderful five-season spell at PSV, but the Brazilian forward's time in Europe is perhaps best remembered for his stint at Barcelona.

The striker's time at Camp Nou was short, but he helped the Catalan club win La Liga and reach the Champions League final in 1994. He won the World Cup with Brazil that summer and was soon playing back in his homeland, briefly returning to La Liga with Valencia in both 1996/97 and 1997/98.

Neymar joined Barcelona from Santos in 2013, helped the Catalan club to a treble in 2015 and inspired a historic comeback against Paris Saint-Germain in 2017.

But later in 2017, he left Barça for PSG in a shock move as the Parisians paid his release clause. The brilliant Brazilian scored over 100 goals for the French giants and won a series of trophies, but his career did perhaps not quite reach the heights it should have. He moved to Saudi Arabia with Al-Hilal in the summer of 2023.

Cafu earned 142 caps for Brazil in a 16-year international career and was a World Cup winner in 1994 and 2002 - the second of those as the captain.

An attacking right-back who was nicknamed Il Pendolino (The Express Train) during his time in Italy, Cafu won Serie A titles with Roma and AC Milan, plus a Champions League with the Rossoneri. In total, he spent 11 years in Italy and also had a brief spell at Real Zaragoza back in 1994/95.

Roberto Carlos is one of the greatest attacking full-backs of all time and the Brazilian was always a threat from free-kicks.

The powerful left-back spent his best years at Real Madrid, winning three Champions League crowns amid a series of trophies and making more than 500 appearances for Los Blancos. A World Cup winner with Brazil in 2002, he also played for Inter, Fenerbahce and briefly with Russian side Anzhi in his European career.

Marcelo spent 15 years at Real Madrid between 2007 and 2022, playing in over 500 matches for Los Blancos and leaving as the most decorated footballer in the club's history.

A five-time Champions League winner with Madrid, Marcelo was the world's best left-back for much of his time at the Santiago Bernabeu. He played 58 times for Brazil and had a brief spell at Olympiacos before returning to his homeland with Fluminense in 2023.

Dani Alves is one of the best right-backs ever and at the time of his retirement, the Brazilian was the most decorated player in football history.

Best remembered for his eight-year spell at Barcelona between 2008 and 2016, Alves played in two treble-winning teams and formed a special understanding with Lionel Messi. He also won trophies at Sevilla, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain in a long and successful career in Europe, but was convicted for rape in 2023 and spent 14 months in prison.

AC Milan fans protested outside the club's headquarters ahead of the Brazilian's sale to Real Madrid in the summer of 2009.

Adored by the Milan fans in a successful six-year spell at San Siro, Kaka won the Ballon d'Or during his time with the Rossoneri. But the attacking midfielder, who was part of Brazil's World Cup-winning squad in 2002, was never quite the same at Madrid. He returned to Milan for a second stay in 2013, but was back in Brazil the following year and finished his career at Orlando FC.

Rivaldo was an extraordinary player at his peak and the Brazilian forward scored an impressive 130 goals in five seasons at Barcelona.

A World Cup winner in 2002, Rivaldo left Barça for AC Milan that same year and won the Champions League with the Rossoneri, although he was an unused substitute in the final. Later, he helped Olympiacos to three Greek titles. He also played for Deportivo La Coruña and AEK Athens in a 12-year European career, which was interrupted only by a short spell at Cruzeiro.

Ronaldinho was the best player in the world for a period in the mid-2000s and the Brazilian forward was an absolute joy to watch during his peak years.

After signing for Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain in 2003, Ronaldinho returned the club to the top after years of poor results, leading the Blaugrana to back-to-back La Liga titles and the Champions League in 2006. His last season and a half was not so good as he fell into decline, but he transformed Barça's fortunes and paved the way for a young Lionel Messi. He later spent two and a half seasons at AC Milan before returning to Brazil in 2011.

Ronaldo's career was interrupted by injuries, but the brilliant Brazilian is still considered one of the greatest footballers of all time.

A two-time World Cup winner with Brazil, Ronaldo did not play in the 1994 triumph but was the team's star in 2002. At club level, he represented PSV, Barcelona, Inter, Real Madrid and AC Milan in Europe across 14 seasons and won a series of major trophies, although never the Champions League.",fourfourtwo.com,news,fourfourtwo.com,Ben Hayward,0.2313725490196079,454053862,46,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHG9JjWuYK8FTyjkVMBio4-1200-80.jpg,

The man who was Gareth Southgate's midfield mainstay for so long will not be going to Germany after being left out of the provisional squad named on Tuesday.

Even at 33, Henderson would surely have been a strong candidate to make the final squad had he still been playing regularly for Liverpool. Such was the strength of Southgate's faith in his abilities.

But Henderson's decision to chase the vast fortunes on offer in the Saudi Arabian Pro League have now come back to bite him with his England career of 81 caps surely now finished.

His £350,000-a-week Saudi dream at Al-Ettifaq turned into a nightmare following intense criticism from LGBTQ+ campaigners, with his family struggling to settle in the Middle East.

Henderson played just six months for the Saudi Pro League club before returning to Europe having been tempted to the Middle East on wages of £350,000-per-week

A mid-season move back to Europe with Ajax hasn't led to an England spot for the Euros

Henderson tried to retrieve the situation - and revive his Euro hopes - by signing for Ajax in January. But he found himself in a poor side that could only finish fifth in the Eredivisie amid off-field turmoil.

It all amounts to a self-inflicted fall from grace for the England regular after a year to forget.

Let's not forget that Henderson was in the England squad as recently as March, an unused substitute in the 2-2 draw with Belgium at Wembley.

He captained the Three Lions in the friendly against Australia back in October and played in the Euro qualifiers against Italy and Malta after that.

During the Southgate era - and for some time prior to that - only injury had kept Henderson out of England's midfield.

He was regarded as a 'Mr Dependable' figure in the engine room, rarely showy but full of energy and trustworthy to make the right pass or marshal team-mates. He is a model professional.

It was far from assured that Henderson would play much part out in Germany but Southgate may well have valued his vast experience around the camp.

But all that has changed and there's an irony that his former Liverpool team-mate Curtis Jones could be the one to take his place.

Surely if Henderson was still a Liverpool player, he'd still be an England player?

His £12million move to Al-Ettifaq, where Steven Gerrard was manager, after 492 games at Liverpool sparked controversy.

At the time, Henderson suggested he anticipated less playing time for Jurgen Klopp at Anfield and was of the belief that regular football for Al-Ettifaq in the burgeoning Pro League would bolster his England Euro chances.

In fairness, he was far from the only big name making a move there and the sales pitch - not to mention the significant increase in salary - must have been persuasive.

But Henderson expended considerable reputational capital in going there. He had previously expressed support to the LGBTQ+ community yet his unveiling video at Al-Ettifaq showed his rainbow armband blacked out in a country where homosexuality is illegal.

Henderson argued that his move to Saudi Arabia was 'a positive thing' as if he might be able to influence a change of attitude from the inside.

Henderson was booed by some England fans as he captained the side against Australia

But that didn't stop some England fans at Wembley booing him during the match with Australia, something which baffled Southgate.

It didn't take long for Henderson to realise life on and off the field in the Middle East wasn't everything he'd been led to believe.

Al-Ettifaq played one game in front of a mere 696 fans, with the majority of interest in the Kingdom reserved for Cristiano Ronaldo's Al-Nassr and Neymar's Al-Hilal.

Playing in oppressive 30C heat was an ordeal and, having become accustomed to challenging for silverware with Liverpool, Henderson suddenly found himself at an also-ran.

It took just three months for reports to surface that wife Rebecca and their children were struggling to settle, despite opting to live in Bahrain, just over the King Fahd Causeway from Dammam, where his club played.

Given the experience of other footballer's partners, who were hissed at by local women as they wore western dress in public in the highly conservative Saudi culture, the reports were unsurprising.

Henderson cut short his three-year contract after just six months - taking a hit on a hefty tax bill - to return to Europe with Ajax.

'It wasn't an easy decision [to leave] but one that I feel is best for me and my family,' Henderson said in his leaving message.

Playing matches in gruelling heat, sometimes approaching 30C, was a test for Henderson during his brief stint with Al-Ettifaq

Even though Southgate had continued selecting him, it was hoped playing a little closer to home in Amsterdam, in a better standard league, would cement one final tournament spot for the summer.

But he couldn't have joined at a worse time. While Henderson talked up Ajax's 'incredible' history and reeled off club legends in his unveiling video, the current vintage was a pale imitation.

At the time of his arrival in mid-January, Ajax were 23 points behind Eredivisie leaders PSV Eindhoven, having been humbled by amateurs USV Hercules in the Dutch Cup and bombed out the Europa League.

Things barely improved. Ajax did indeed end up fifth, a mammoth 35 points shy of champions PSV and were humiliated by Aston Villa in the Europa Conference League.

The nadir came when bitter rivals Feyenoord thrashed them 6-0 in early April - their record Eredivisie loss. A certain Arne Slot is now poised to take over at Liverpool.

The Three Lions can oh so close in the previous edition of the European Championship, losing on penalties to Italy in the final.

Southgate had also managed to get England to the semi-finals of the World Cup back in 2018, and despite being comfortable against Croatia, they ran out of steam and were eventually beaten.

Therefore, if he wants to go one better than before, he has got to get things spot on in terms of squad selection.

According to The Athletic (subscription required), ahead of the official announcement, Southgate has already sprung one massive surprise which will almost certainly get tongues wagging.

A player that epitomises all of the qualities that the manager expects from his players is Ajax ace, Jordan Henderson.

The former Liverpool captain is a calm, experienced head in the midfield and a warrior when required, but it seems that his failed move to Saudi Arabia and subsequent inability to help Ajax towards the upper echelons of the Eredivisie - they finished 35 points behind title winners PSV - has cost him his place. His age, 33, will undoubtedly have also counted against him.

The outlet also note that his former club colleague, Curtis Jones, is likely to get a first senior call-up, indicating just how much his star has risen over the past 12-18 months.

There's sure to be a handful of other surprises when the official announcement comes, not forgetting of course that this is just a provisional squad and more players will need to drop out before the final 26 players are named.

If England go on to do well in the tournament, no one will bat an eyelid, however, if the Three Lions exit the tournament earlier than expected, Southgate will have some explaining to do.",caughtoffside.com,news,CaughtOffside,Jason Pettigrove,0.1529411764705881,453983084,1,https://icdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fbl-eng-training-1.jpg,eng-9584085

Unfortunately, a handful of teams must always go down. Well, unless the league in question is undergoing an identity crisis, but that's a topic for another day.

No matter how damaging it is, we thrive on that sweet, sweet jeopardy as fans, with relegation setting up brilliant comeback stories or crises that clubs have to navigate for the rest of time.

You know about the big clubs to go down, but what about the teams you missed? We've scoured around the divisions that have now concluded for the season and picked out five clubs whose relegation has seriously stunned us.

Three years ago, Granada beat Napoli over two legs in the Europa League round of 32 and were only knocked out in the quarter-final by Manchester United, while also finishing ninth in La Liga.

They were relegated in 2021-22, but fought back to the top-flight and returned to La Liga at the first attempt for the 2022-23 campaign. They've lasted just two years this time round, however, having won just four times all season and shipped 72 goals, still with a game to play.

Alongside Almeria and Cadiz, it means all three relegated teams in Spain come from Andalucia.

A sudden fall-off for a side punching above their weight not so long ago.

TRY A QUIZ: Can you name every team to play in the Europa League knockout stages?

A Serie A mainstay for the last 11 years, Sassuolo had picked up a reputation as a giant killer in Italy.

While never quite setting the world alight, the Neroverdi always felt like the perfect banana skin for the traditional big guns in Serie A.

They managed back-to-back eighth-place finishes in 2019-20 and 2020-21 and have made a habit of taking points off the likes of Milan, Napoli, Roma, Juventus and Inter in recent seasons.

They beat Scudetto winners Inter at the San Siro at the beginning of this season and again in May, just weeks after playing out a 3-3 draw with Milan, but unfortunately, that hasn't been enough to stop a sudden slide down the table that has proven fatal.

They'll play in Serie B next season for the first time since 2013.

Known by some as Vitesse Arnhem and by many as that Dutch club who take all of Chelsea's youngsters on loan, Vitesse have never been the biggest team in the Netherlands.

But they enjoyed a successful 1990s, have brought through a number of the game's greatest players and won the KNVB Cup as recently as 2017.

The club has been in the top flight every season without fail since 1989, but will play its football in the second-tier Eerste Divise in 2024-25 after being handed the largest points deduction in the history of Dutch football back in April.

Vitesse were docked an astounding 18 points after an investigation concluded that the club had strong connections to Russian oligarch and former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism revealed: ""At least €117m was loaned from two Abramovich-owned companies to Vitesse under the club's two previous owners, Merab Jordania and Alexander Chigirinsky.""

To make matters more drastic, the club find themselves in a financial hole they cannot escape. Current majority owner - another Russian oligarch - Valeriy Oyf announced his intentions to sell his shares in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but has been unable to do so.

It leaves the club heading into the second tier with their ownership in the air, no financial support and the possibility of having their licence revoked as a result, while the KNVB tries to help them towards a solution.

A truly dire situation for supporters and staff.

They've been a bit of a yoyo club over the last 20 years, but FC Koln's latest stint in the Bundesliga seemed to be their most promising in a while, finishing as high as seventh in 2021-22 after being promoted back to the top-flight in 2019.

The two-time Bundesliga champions have been relegated after five consecutive seasons in the top-flight, however, finishing six points adrift of VfL Bochum in the relegation play-off spot, who will joust with Dusseldorf to try and keep their top-flight status.

Having won the second tier four times, FC Koln - also known as Cologne - would typically back themselves to return to the top flight, but a transfer ban hanging over their heads complicates matters.

When you think of the City Football Group, you think of a rather sickening corporate machine tarnishing football worldwide, made more annoying by these 'well-run' clubs seemingly justify multi-club ownership models.

Fans of French outfit Troyes will open your eyes to an entirely different, much more bleak reality.

Troyes have now officially faced back-to-back relegations, going from playing in Ligue 1 in 2022-23, to playing in the French third tier for the 2024-25 season after being relegated from Ligue 2.

The main football club of a town in northern France with a population of around 62,000 people, Troyes have never been giants historically, but were acquired by CFG in 2020 and have essentially been used as a merry-go-round for players and staff ever since.

This has led to their sharp freefall from the top flight to the Championnat National.

To put into context how Troyes have been mistreated, Brazilian winger Savio was made their record signing in 2020, but never played a game for the club, having been immediately loaned to PSV and later fellow CFG club Girona.

Jansen managed AZ for four years between 2020 and January 2024, but was sacked after 162 games in charge of the Dutch club, winning 94 and boasting a 58pc win ratio.

Known for playing attractive, attacking football, AZ are known for their development of young players and Jansen has a background in academy football in the Netherlands, having previously worked at Sparta Rotterdam, Vitesse and PSV in youth coaching roles.

Jansen was previously linked with the managerial vacancy at Rangers and earned acclaim for his combination of developing youth and clear playing philosophy. He was formerly the assistant to new Liverpool manager Arne Slot at Alkmaar before taking the step up in 2020.

His dismissal in January came following a poor performance in Europe, but Alkmaar were sitting fourth in the Eredivisie table at that stage.

Jansen appeared on Dutch TV oN Sunday night and when asked about his future, said via Studio Voetbal: ""I did have two very interesting conversations. Those were wonderful conversations and I have visited beautiful clubs in recent months. They have been mentioned in the media, yes.""

Born in London, Jansen is highly rated and spoke about his playing philosophy, inspired by Johan Cruyff, in an interview with the Guardian in 2023.

""I've always been interested in what happens in Italy, Spain and the Premier League. You can learn if you're open-minded. If you're educated from the Dutch point of view you have a very offensive way of thinking. We were inspired by Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff.

""It's having the ball and being creative, but also not being naive by only playing attack and forgetting what it's like to be out of possession. I strongly believe if you want to attack as much as we do you have to be better in defending than anybody could imagine.""

The report adds that former Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper has rejected the possibility of discussing the vacancy, opting to bide his time before returning to the dug-out again.

Carlos Cuesta, assistant to Mikel Arteta at Arsenal and bookmakers favourite, isn't thought to be a main target for City at this stage despite links earlier in the season.

If the two German-born players get on the field together in the same match, they would become the first pair of brothers to play side-by-side for the U.S. since 1988. They already are the 10th set of brothers to both play for the national team at any time.

Also named to the squad were midfielders Tyler Adams, Gio Reyna and Weston McKennie and forwards Christian Pulisic, Folarin Balogun and Josh Sargent, whose last appearance for the U.S. came in the 2022 World Cup. Sargent, who scored 16 times in 26 games for Norwich City in England's second-tier Championship, is one of 18 World Cup players on the roster.

The Tillmans, dual nationals born to a German mother and U.S. serviceman father in Nuremberg, Germany, played for both the German and U.S. youth national teams growing up. But both opted to play for the U.S. on the senior level, with Malik, who turns 22 next week, making his debut in 2022 and Timothy, 25, making his five months ago.

Malik Tillman, who has played for four teams in three countries in Europe, has appeared in 10 matches for the USMNT, the last coming in the CONCACAF Nations League final last March. Timothy, who joined LAFC last season, made his only appearance for the U.S. in a January friendly with Slovenia in which he started and played 89 minutes.

With LAFC, he is tied for second on the team with four goals in 13 MLS games. Among outfield players, only Denis Bouanga has played more minutes in league play than Tillman. He is one of just four MLS players named to the training camp roster.

The U.S. will face Colombia on June 8 in Landover, Md., and Brazil four days later in Orlando, after which Berhalter will name his roster for this summer's Copa América. The USMNT hasn't beaten Colombia in its last seven tries dating to 2005, the team's second-longest current winless streak. The longest? Eleven against Brazil dating to 1998.

While stumping up respectable numbers at Fiorentina and Roma, the 'Egyptian King' had never broken the 20-goal barrier for a single campaign in his pre-Anfield days.

Seven years on from one of the best pound-for-pound signings in Premier League history, Mo Salah has 211 goals in 349 Liverpool games. His worst tally, meanwhile, came in the 2019/20 campaign. And even then he still struck the net 23 times.

If Albert Gudmundsson goes on to enjoy even a fraction of the success Salah has had at Liverpool, then the reported Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur target would be worth every penny of his own £34 million price-tag. And then some.

Kevin Strootman, who played alongside Salah at Roma and now shares a dressing room with Gudmundsson at Genoa, is better placed than most to draw comparisons between the two. And he feels that the one-time AZ Alkmaar forward can 'make the same leap' as Liverpool's legendary number 11, having adapted brilliantly to life in Serie A.

""I said that Salah didn't always score goals at Roma, despite being clear on goal (in one-v-one situations) four or five times per game,"" Strootman tells Radio TV Serie A.

""Others said that, if he did score every time he was clear, then he would be at Real Madrid or Liverpool rather than Roma. And that is where he ended up.

""If Gud can make the same leap, I think he can do well at a super top club. He must do it to become a world-class player because his quality is already beyond doubt. He is a serious professional and I am sure he'll do even better over the next few years.""

Gudmundsson, once of PSV Eindhoven, often left supporters frustrated when it came to finishing off opportunities in the Eredivisie. Few in Alkmaar would have imagined that, when he left for Genoa back in 2022, he'd have 16 goals for a team plying their trade in Italy's top flight just two years later.

Versatile, extremely hard-working and a whizz at set-pieces, Gudmundsson may not be the direct Harry Kane replacement some Tottenham fans are craving, amid interest in Feyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez.

But if he can do something similar in North London to what Salah did on Merseyside, then the Reykjavik-born 26-year-old could bring a much-needed ruthlessness to a Spurs team who had only two players in double-figures in the 2023/24 Premier League campaign; the injury-hit Richarlison and the ageing Heung-Min Son.

Genoa CEO Andres Blazquez, meanwhile, tells Tuttomercatoweb that any club looking to sign Gudmundsson would have to part with 40 million euros. Or, if you prefer, £34 million, a fee very similar to the one Liverpool paid for Salah when the Klopp era was still in it's infancy.

HITC, meanwhile, understands that - if Salah wants to secure a move to Saudi Arabia one year after Al-Ittihad's £150 million bid - he will have to communicate that to the club directly.",hitc.com,news,HITC,Dan Owen,0.3254901960784313,453920592,1,https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2148634541-scaled.jpg,eng-9582437

Back then, the speculation surrounding the club's impending managerial vacancy was swirling around Ruben Amorim, the highly-rated young coach of Sporting Lisbon.

But rather than head to Portugal, Hughes had a date with a different manager arranged for just outside Rotterdam; one Liverpool had identified as the perfect successor to Jurgen Klopp.

It was the first time Hughes had met Feyenoord coach Arne Slot. Still, by that stage, he felt he knew the 45-year-old inside-out, having spent the previous weeks immersed in the data, video analysis and character references that had established him as Liverpool's No 1 choice.

Having sat and listened to why he was the preferred candidate, Slot made it clear that this was a challenge he was eager to accept.Keen to avoid creating any unwanted distractions before his Feyenoord side's KNVB Cup final against NEC Nijmegen on Sunday, April 21, Liverpool waited until after that triumph before opening talks with the Dutch club the following Wednesday.

Feyenoord chief executive Dennis Te Kloese proved to be a tough negotiator as the two clubs sorted out a compensation package of around €11million (£9.4m, $11.8m), according to Liverpool sources, while the Dutch club indicated the figures may rise beyond €13m.

Slot agreed terms on a three-year deal, having told Liverpool he was comfortable with the title of head coach rather than manager in a new-look hierarchy at Anfield which sees him answer to Hughes and Fenway Sports Group's CEO of football Michael Edwards. He will bring assistant Sipke Hulshoff and head of performance Ruben Peeters to Merseyside with him.

An official announcement was delayed until after the end of the season, allowing both Slot and Klopp to say formal goodbyes to their home fans last weekend. Slot will take up his duties on June 1, subject to a work permit.

This is the inside story of Liverpool's managerial search, gathered from conversations with multiple sources who had detailed knowledge of the process but who asked to remain anonymous to protect their positions.

We can now reveal:

Slot's arrival is a pivotal moment for him and Liverpool's new executive pairing of Edwards and Hughes. All three know their reputations will be shaped by what happens next, and whether Klopp's legacy can be built on.

When Klopp publicly announced his decision on January 26 to stand down at the end of the season, Liverpool's owners had known for two months that major changes were on the horizon.

Director of research Will Spearman and his team of analysts had been tasked with getting to work on the club's data-led approach for a suitable replacement.

However, the owners' initial priority was putting a structure in place that would enable Liverpool to adjust to the post-Klopp era. Central to that plan was convincing Edwards to return two years after he had stepped down as sporting director, with FSG president Mike Gordon keen to take a step back.

Once Edwards was handed overall control of football operations in early March, the appointment of Hughes as sporting director was a formality. The former Scotland international, whose association with Edwards goes back two decades to their time together at Portsmouth, was already serving his notice period at Bournemouth.

Together they set about assessing the credentials of coaches across Europe.

The criteria were clear. Liverpool wanted a coach with a distinct identity in terms of his brand of football: dynamic, high energy and possession-based. Being prepared to take the title of head coach, rather than manager, was important. But while the successful candidate needed to have proved himself as a hands-on training ground operator, he also needed to harness the power of Liverpool's fanbase in the tradition of the club's most successful managers.

A good record of keeping players fit and available was considered vital, as was a history of improving players. The focus was on making the right choice -- not necessarily the most popular one -- and Hughes and Edwards were prepared to be courageous in their decision-making.

Externally, Xabi Alonso was viewed as the front-runner. The Spaniard, who has transformed the fortunes of Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen, was putting his side on course for their first league title in their 119-year history. He also has a close bond with Liverpool from his playing days. Even Klopp, who played no part in the process, described Alonso as ""incredible"" and the ""standout"" manager of a new generation of coaches.

There was an obvious appeal to Alonso, but as far back as February it was regarded by Edwards and the Liverpool hierarchy as unlikely.

Hughes has a strong relationship with Alonso's agent Inaki Ibanez, who also represents Bournemouth coach Andoni Iraola. They had discussed Alonso's burgeoning managerial career -- and possible future path -- long before Hughes was lined up to join Edwards in shaping the post-Klopp era at Liverpool.

Those conversations intensified around the time Hughes's move to Merseyside was confirmed, but Ibanez was insistent: Alonso intended to stay at Leverkusen next season and did not want to discuss any other job, not even at his former clubs Liverpool or Bayern Munich.

Bayern's very public pursuit of Alonso while lagging behind his Leverkusen team in the Bundesliga title race, muddied the waters. Reports from Munich suggested Bayern would be his favoured destination if he were to move. Liverpool believed the opposite, but that Alonso was likely to stay put.

That line of communication was kept open, but the message from Ibanez did not change. Alonso did not want any offers or proposals.

Alonso stated publicly on March 29 that he would be staying at Leverkusen, following talks with his club's sporting director Simon Rolfes during the international break. The call Hughes received from Ibanez earlier that week had merely confirmed what the Scot already knew.

Nobody at Liverpool denies Alonso would have been a serious candidate if he had been open to taking the job. But they dispute that a declaration of interest from their former midfielder would have made it a one-horse race. Slot, they say, was firmly in their thoughts by that stage.

When Liverpool appointed Klopp in succession to Brendan Rodgers in October 2015, FSG put great trust in the data that was presented to them by Edwards, who had recently been appointed technical director, and theoretical physicist Ian Graham.

At that time, much of it was highlighting the excellence of Borussia Dortmund's record under Klopp and how, even though results had dipped significantly in his final season in charge, the relatively new phenomenon of expected goals (xG) illustrated they had endured a somewhat freakish run of bad luck that should not deter them appointing him - a sound recommendation, it turned out.

Nearly a decade on, Liverpool's data-gathering goes much deeper. Spearman, a Chicago-born Harvard-educated physicist who spent five years as Liverpool's lead data scientist before succeeding Graham as the club's director of research in January last year, has been working on an algorithm that evaluates coaching performance on a wide range of metrics -- not just team performance but playing style, individual player development, compatibility with different types of players etc -- to predict future outcomes and suitability for certain jobs.

Slot's scores, reflecting his performance during three seasons in charge of Feyenoord, are said to have been blindingly impressive: ""Top of the top"". Hughes and Edwards had already discussed Slot, among others, as a strong contender. But they had not expected the data to bring such a resounding endorsement of his candidacy.

It wasn't just the data. Hughes had studied Slot's Feyenoord team extensively in his role as Bournemouth technical director, signing Argentina defender Marcos Senesi from the Dutch club in August 2022 and having also watched other players such as right-back Marcus Pedersen (now on loan at Italian club Sassuolo), left-back Quilindschy Hartman (who has filled the gap left by Tyrell Malacia's move to Manchester United in July 2022) and Colombia winger Luis Sinisterra (who ended up joining Bournemouth via a year at Leeds United).

There were other Feyenoord players Hughes looked at, on his scouts' recommendation. But it became a standing joke in Bournemouth's recruitment department as Hughes told his scouts to stop recommending Feyenoord players because: ""It's not about the players. It's about the coach and his system.""

There was a recognition inside Liverpool that it would be impossible to find a facsimile of Klopp -- and, because he was regarded as such a one-off, that it would be ill-advised to try. But in Slot, they saw some appealing parallels with the German coach who won seven major trophies at Anfield and has been the club's most transformative manager since Bill Shankly. Edwards and Hughes feel Slot's exciting, intense, high-pressing, possession-based brand of attacking football ticked the box of energising Liverpool's players and crowd. Given their belief in the playing talent already at the club, they are convinced his style will be a good fit for the squad he inherits.

Crucially, given that Jarell Quansah, Conor Bradley, Bobby Clark, James McConnell, Jayden Danns and Lewis Koumas have made the step up to senior football this season, Slot also has a proven track record of putting his faith in and developing young talent.

The data served to underline how Slot had Feyenoord punching above their weight. In May 2022, he led them to the final of the Europa Conference League (where they were beaten 1-0 by Roma). Domestically, he was crowned Eredivisie manager of the year.

Despite the departures of key players and having only a fraction of the resources available to rivals PSV Eindhoven and Ajax, he led a new-look team to league title glory and the quarter-finals of the Europa League in 2022-23.

This season they won the KNVB Cup and finished runners-up to PSV in the league. His first taste of managing in the Champions League saw them finish third in their group behind Atletico Madrid and Lazio before dropping into the Europa League where they were beaten on penalties, again by Roma.

Liverpool's current coaching staff were not asked for their views on Klopp's successor, but Slot has a big advocate in Pep Lijnders, who will also leave the club this summer.

Slot visited Lijnders' house when he was starting as a youth coach nearly a decade ago and they exchanged ideas over several hours. Lijnders regards Slot as the best Dutch coach around: someone who is tactically smart and an innovator, with a clear playing style and the personality to handle the step up.

In recent years, Lijnders has frequently talked up Slot's body of work in conversations with senior Anfield figures.

Hughes also spoke to Bournemouth defender Senesi and others who have played for him, but also people who have seen his work at Feyenoord at close quarters. A consistent message from Rotterdam cited the way he transmits his energy to the players and the fanbase.

Like Liverpool, Rotterdam is a football-mad port city. The way he has taken the players, the club and the fanbase on a journey with him was felt to be pleasingly familiar. That was not a prerequisite in the search for Klopp's successor. But in Slot's case, on top of his other qualities, it was a bonus.

For at least three weeks after Alonso ruled himself out of contention, the coach most persistently linked to the Liverpool job was Amorim, who has led Sporting to the brink of a second Primeira Liga title in four seasons, and who before his appointment had not won the title in 19 years.

In the second week of April, reports in Portugal suggested Amorim had been offered the position as Klopp's successor and had verbally agreed a three-year contract.Liverpool vehemently denied that, as did the man himself. ""There was no interview and certainly no agreement,"" the 39-year-old said on April 11.

The reports about Amorim -- whose fitness coach at Sporting, Paulo Barreira, was a former Anfield staff member -- caused a degree of annoyance at Liverpool, who did not want any candidate, such as Slot, thinking the job had been offered to anyone else. The reality is that Amorim, who was keen to move to the Premier League, did feature on Liverpool's list, having scored well in much of the data analysis, but he was never a front-runner. Amorim's agent Raul Costa came to Merseyside in early April but that trip was primarily to visit Luis Diaz, the Liverpool winger he also represents.

While impressed by his record, Edwards and Hughes had doubts about Amorim's compatibility with the Liverpool job specifically.

They were unconvinced that his preference for a three-man central defence -- shared by Alonso at Leverkusen, incidentally -- would suit many of the players he would be working with. But more significant was a nagging concern about Amorim's playing style. Sporting may have scored 96 goals in 34 league matches this season, but theirs is regarded as a slower style that is less front-foot -- both in and out of possession.

There were similar conclusions about De Zerbi at Brighton and Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann. Like Amorim, De Zerbi was on a theoretical shortlist but not one of the first names on it. Playing style and compatibility with Liverpool were again considered to be a factor.

Others who were discussed briefly included Iraola, whose Bournemouth contract had been due to expire in 2025 (he signed a new one last week), and Newcastle United's Eddie Howe, having both worked under Hughes at Bournemouth, together with Stuttgart coach Sebastian Hoeness (whose data scores were closely aligned with Klopp's, and who had many admirers at Liverpool) and Michel, who has enjoyed a superb season at Girona in La Liga.

Inter Milan's Simone Inzaghi (a well-respected coach whose lack of English was potentially problematic) and Lille's Paulo Fonseca (now interesting AC Milan) were also considered, but they were never seriously in the frame.

Bayern's outgoing coach Thomas Tuchel, who succeeded Klopp at Dortmund in 2015 and won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021, was not in contention. Indeed, many of the names linked to the job were either never in the frame due to being incompatible with Liverpool's criteria or were simply pushing their candidatures.

The claims of Valverde, however, were regarded by Liverpool as much stronger. The 60-year-old was a leading contender, having won two league titles at Barcelona, three championships in Greece with Olympiacos and recently ended Athletic Bilbao's 40-year wait for a major trophy by winning the Copa del Rey last month. He would also have fitted the 'brave' 'criteria laid out by Hughes and Edwards.

Luciano Spalletti, 65, was also of significant interest. Last season, he guided Napoli to their first Serie A title since 1990, but he had only been appointed to manage the Italy national team last August. The fact that both men were seriously considered, however, suggested that age was not a major consideration in Liverpool's thinking.

When Edwards and Hughes set out to find Klopp's successor, they envisaged a process where they might start with 20 candidates and gradually whittle them down to 10, then perhaps five and then three for a final round of interviews.

It ended up being more straightforward than that. They might have had a notional shortlist, but they also had settled on Slot as their preferred candidate and successfully persuaded Gordon and the rest of Liverpool's ownership team to open formal negotiations with Feyenoord.

The Real Jurgen Klopp - an Athletic special series

When Klopp originally announced his decision to stand down at the end of this season, Feyenoord executives did not believe they had much cause for concern.

They knew Slot would score well on data assessments of high-performing European managers, but there was no expectation that a club with the scope and size of Liverpool would come in for him. But the landscape changed dramatically at the start of last week. Feyenoord were not thrilled to learn that Liverpool's approach to them had only taken place after talks had been held with Slot.

On one level, Liverpool's strategy made sense because, with no release clause in Slot's contract at De Kuip, they needed to secure his approval and potentially agitate in order to force matters. But with the world now knowing that Slot was Liverpool's top target, it strengthened the Dutch club's negotiating position. They could now force up the price.

Hughes came up against Feyenoord chief executive Te Kloese, who has previously worked as general manager at Los Angeles Galaxy in MLS, and been director of youth football and general manager at the Mexican Football Association.

Te Kloese is regarded as a strong negotiator and having played a key role in Feyenoord's finances and player recruitment, his importance in the club's recent achievements could be seen to rival Slot's.

Another club's sporting director, who came up against him previously, said: ""I love his approach. To your face, he will be smiling and you think it is moving, but then nothing moves in the background until he is really happy with his deal.""

Feyenoord had become well accustomed to rumours linking Slot with a move to the Premier League. He had rejected previous approaches from Leeds United and Crystal Palace before Tottenham Hotspur tried to secure his services last summer.

Contingency plans were made and potential replacements considered on that occasion, but Te Kloese persuaded him to stay and sign a new deal.

Slot's previous contract stipulated that he could have been extracted for a fixed sum of €5million in the summer of 2024. But his new contract, which theoretically ran until 2026, removed that clause and strengthened Feyenoord's hand.

Negotiations with Liverpool started on the morning of April 24 and tensions spiked after an initial offer of €9m was rejected.

That prompted Slot to speak out prior to Feyenoord's Eredivisie game against Go Ahead Eagles four days later when he declared it was ""clear"" he wanted to take over at Liverpool and that he was ""confident"" the two sides would reach an agreement.

Slot referred to the fact that he had generated a lot of money for Feyenoord by developing players who had been subsequently sold on and that they would be receiving the highest compensation fee ever paid for a Dutch coach.

Talks continued throughout the Friday and, with Saturday, April 27 being King's Day -- a public holiday in the Netherlands -- there were fears they might drag on until the following week.

However, an improved offer from Hughes broke the impasse and a verbal agreement was secured on Friday evening. Liverpool then began to sort out the finer details on personal terms in discussions with Slot and his representative Rafaela Pimenta, the highly influential agent who also represents Manchester City striker Erling Haaland.

Slot had hoped to convince Marino Pusic, formerly an assistant at Feyenoord, to be on his Anfield staff, but he only joined Shakhtar Donetsk as their head coach last October and wishes to remain in that job.

Slot will be joined by trusted assistant Hulshoff, who is no stranger to Liverpool trio Virgil van Dijk, Cody Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch as he also serves on the Netherlands national team staff with Ronald Koeman. Head of performance Peeters will also make the switch to Liverpool.

Appointing Slot is not without risk, and some outside of Anfield are sceptical. He has just two major Dutch trophies to his name, which is low for a manager of a club with Liverpool's profile, and has had only fleeting experiences in the Champions League. Klopp, too, only had three major trophies on his CV when he arrived at Anfield -- but two were Bundesliga titles, with a greater cachet than the Eredivisie, and he had also reached a Champions League final.

Slot is also a forthright personality. He has high standards and is used to getting what he wants, which helps explain his success but can also be antagonistic. There was a flash of this in the way he publicly called to be allowed to join Liverpool when negotiations with Feyenoord over compensation threatened to become difficult, but a more pronounced example came at AZ Alkmaar in December 2020.

Feyenoord had announced that Dick Advocaat would be leaving his role as manager at the end of the season and held talks with Slot. AZ, who did not know these discussions were taking place, were furious and sacked Slot for going behind their backs (Slot eventually joined Feyenoord in summer 2021). But as his AZ predecessor John van den Brom observed of the situation: ""You always want to leave by the front door. So it wasn't good for Arne and it wasn't good for the club.""

None of this will surprise Hughes and Edwards, but Liverpool will need them to quickly develop an effective working relationship with Slot as they plot their post-Klopp future.

His appointment has been received well internally at Liverpool, where some staff members have had contact with him stretching back long before this process began. They consider him likeable and collaborative and feel that Slot seems to be an ideal cultural fit.

The size of the task awaiting Slot was obvious on Sunday, when Klopp's send-off from Anfield prompted an outpouring of emotion rarely seen in English football.

It hasn't gotten much attention lately that the U.S. men's soccer team is about to do the most important thing it will do before cohosting the World Cup in two years.

But perhaps that will start to change soon, now that manager Gregg Berhalter has named a 27-player squad for a training camp before the Copa América starts in just under a month.

Union alumni Brenden Aaronson and Mark McKenzie both made the cut after up-and-down seasons in Europe, with Aaronson's the more notable.

The Medford, N.J., native spent the campaign at Germany's Union Berlin, on loan from England's Leeds United. Union was in the Champions League for the first time, and it proved more than the team could handle. After winning the first two games of the season in August, Union didn't win again for 16 games until December.

That left Union battling relegation in the Bundesliga for much of the season. It fired two managers along the way, and escaped only on the last day of the season.

In fact, in each of Union's last two games, Aaronson was subbed off with Union ahead, and it blew the lead both times. But fate smiled on the team in its finale, when a 92nd-minute winner delivered salvation.

"" READ MORE: Gregg Berhalter hopes more of the U.S. will get to see the USMNT before the World Cup

Union announced Monday morning that Aaronson's time in Berlin is up. The sense is that Leeds doesn't want him back, so we'll have to wait to see where he goes next.

McKenzie has two games left in his third season at Belgium's Genk. The team finished the regular season in an underwhelming sixth place, and is now in a round-robin playoff of the top six for next season's European places.

Genk is two points out of a berth in next season's Europa League, and worryingly has lost its last four games. McKenzie has played in 41 games this season, tallying 3,775 minutes, one goal, and three assists.

The U.S. camp roster is 27 players. The Copa roster can be up to 26, with 23 players on each game day squad.

There are two crucial things Berhalter must figure out. First is who will start at right back, since usual starter Sergiño Dest is out with a torn ACL. Joe Scally of Germany's Borussia Mönchengladbach seems likely to step in, with Shaq Moore of Nashville SC the other true right back on this squad.

Then there's striker, where Berhalter notably called in all four of his top Europe-based candidates.

Folarin Balogun is usually the starter, but had an underwhelming season at France's Monaco with just eight goals and seven assists in 32 games. Ricardo Pepi, who's also been a U.S. regular recently, had just nine goals and three assists in 41 games -- with just 764 minutes on the field -- for the Netherlands' PSV Eindhoven.

Haji Wright of England's Coventry City had the best season: 19 goals and eight assists in 50 games. He shone not just in the second-tier Championship, but in the FA Cup where Coventry almost upset mighty Manchester United in the semifinals.

Josh Sargent of England's Norwich City also had a strong campaign in the second division, with 16 goals and two assists in 30 games.

Three names initially stand out among players who weren't called in: right back Bryan Reynolds of Belgium's Westerlo, Media-born centerback Auston Trusty (another Union alum) of England's Sheffield United, and striker Brandon Vazquez of Mexico's Monterrey.

But they might be heading to the Olympics instead. In early June, the U.S. under-23 team will gather in Kansas City for its last training camp before the tournament roster is set. As the 18-man squads can have three over-age players, Trusty and Vazquez could be among the picks. Reynolds is 22, so he's age-eligible.

We'll learn more from Berhalter when he holds a news conference later Monday morning.

The Copa América is South America's national team championship. It's unusual to host it outside of the continent, but when scheduled host Ecuador announced it couldn't do it, the U.S. quickly jumped in.

As the U.S. hosted a special centennial edition of the tournament in 2016, South America's confederation (CONMEBOL) knew how much money it would make by coming back here this time. Everyone involved also knew it would be a great warm-up for the World Cup.

So here they are again, with an expanded field of 16 teams like there was in 2016: 10 from South America and six from North and Central America.

The U.S.' group stage opponents will be Bolivia on June 23 in Arlington, Texas; Panama on June 27 in Atlanta; and Uruguay on July 1 in Kansas City, in what will be a huge game.

The Americans should get out of the group and reach the knockout rounds, where either Brazil or Colombia will likely await in the quarterfinals. Win that game and they'll probably face the other of those teams. Costa Rica and Paraguay are also in Brazil and Colombia's group, though they're unlikely to advance.

The quarterfinal game would be in Glendale, Ariz., or Las Vegas on July 6, and the semifinal would be in Charlotte on July 10. Charlotte also hosts the third-place game on July 13, and Miami hosts the final on July 14.

It so happens that the U.S. will face Colombia and Brazil in its pre-tournament warm-up games: Colombia on June 8 in Landover, Md., and Brazil on June 12 in Orlando.

Goalkeeper Zack Steffen was left off by U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter despite making 14 starts for Colorado in his return to Major League Soccer. Ethan Horvath and Sean Johnson were picked along with Turner as Berhalter went with the same three goalkeepers he took to the 2022 World Cup.

Players omitted from the 2022 World Cup roster included defenders Aaron Long, DeAndre Yedlin and Walker Zimmerman, midfielders Kellyn Acosta and Cristian Roldan, and forwards Jesús Ferreira and Jordan Morris. Right back Sergiño Dest will miss the tournament after tearing an ACL in training with PSV Eindhoven on April 20.

Players on the roster who didn't go to Qatar included defenders Kristoffer Lund, Mark McKenzie, Chris Richards and Miles Robinson, midfielders Johnny Cardoso, Malik Tillman and Timmy Tillman, and forwards Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi.

Players report from May 28 through June 2, and the U.S. plays Colombia on June 8 at Landover, Maryland, and Brazil four days later at Orlando, Florida. The U.S opens the Copa America against Bolivia on June 23 at Arlington, Texas, and then has first-round games against Panama and Uruguay.

Teams must submit their 26-man Copa America rosters by June 15. The Americans finished fourth in the 1995 and 2016 editions, and failed to advance past the first round in 1993 and 2007.

Turner lost his starting job at Nottingham Forest after allowing a series of weak goals and played just one club match after Feb. 28 and none since April 2.

Adams, the United States captain, played just one club match from March 2023 until this past March 13 because of a torn right hamstring that needed surgery. After returning to play two matches for Bournemouth in March, the midfielder was limited to one game over the rest of the season, an 11-minute appearance on May 11.

Reyna played just 280 league minutes for Borussia Dortmund in the first half of the season and 235 for Nottingham Forest following a Jan. 31 loan. He didn't play at all after April 28.

Ream lost his starting role at Fulham during the second half of the season. The 36-year-old started and captained the Cottagers in Sunday´s season finale, his first appearance since Feb. 17.

Just four players are from Major League Soccer: goalkeeper Sean Johnson, defenders Shaq Moore and Miles Robinson, and midfielder Timmy Tillman.

Marquee signings such as Mason Mount, Sandro Tonali and Ansu Fati have all underwhelmed since the signing for their respective clubs. The 15 worst signings from the 23/24 Premier League campaign have been ranked based on transfer fee, holistic impact and many other factors. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

Manchester City are the 2023/24 Premier League champions. Arsenal came so close. Liverpool and surprise package Aston Villa secured Champions League football, while Luton Town, Sheffield United and Burnley have all been relegated after one season back in the Premier League. It's been a whirlwind of a season with some of the division's shiniest stars stealing the headlines on a weekly basis.

Whether it's been Pep Guardiola's star boy and Player of the Season recipient Phil Foden for his exceptional goal return and overall brilliance or Arsenal skipper Martin Odegaard for his unrelenting creative presence, many people look to gloss over the not-so-exciting parts of the season: the worst signings.

There have been a host of players, from Chelsea all the way down to Nottingham Forest, who have not lived up to expectations since arriving either in the summer of 2023 or in January during the mid-season trading period. Taking the following ranking factors into consideration, here are the top 15 worst signings of the 2023/24 English top flight campaign - ranked from 1st to 15th.

Ranking factors Overall importance to their side's league position Goals and assists tally Transfer fee The holistic impact of their arrival Whether they've garnered further interest from other clubs Memorable mistakes/poor performances Their relationship with the fans 1 Sandro Tonali AC Milan to Newcastle United

All while becoming Newcastle United's most-expensive signing in their fabled history, Sandro Tonali's addition gave Eddie Howe and Co a glimmer of hope as they entered a new era of Champions League football. As one of AC Milan's leading playmakers, their hefty outlay of £60 million didn't seem to be above board.

Lodi-born Tonali may have scored on his debut against Aston Villa, but it's been less fruitful since, with him being hit with a 10-month suspension in October. The midfielder, one of the best players who will miss Euro 2024, enjoyed 692 minutes of action before his ban. By no means is the Italian a bad footballer - but his lack of game time has potentially cost them a spot in the Champions League next season.

2 Kalvin Phillips Manchester City to West Ham (on loan)

An opportunity arose for Kalvin Phillips to get some much-needed game time under his belt in the 2023/24 mid-season window. With dislodging the likes of Rodri and Mateo Kovacic becoming too onerous of a task, the Englishman opted for West Ham United on a six-month stint. His east London tenure has not been as fruitful as many would've hoped, though.

What with two huge errors against Bournemouth and Manchester United tainting the start of what could have been a revival for the former Leeds United gem, David Moyes duly lost faith in his ability. The Scotsman has restricted the one-time Champions League winner to a mere 319 minutes since his January arrival.

3 Ansu Fati Barcelona to Brighton & Hove Albion

Once courted to become the next 'Lionel Messi', particularly when he took over his No.10 shirt at Barcelona, Ansu Fati fell sharply down the pecking order in Spain after succumbing to a string of injuries - combined with the emergence of Lamina Yamal - often kept him out of contention.

The Spaniard, 21, scored twice in his first five outings for Brighton & Hove Albion, but injury woes persisted with the hustle and bustle of England's top division seemingly too robust for one of the best young talents in world football. Since his early duo of goals against Aston Villa and Manchester City, he's failed to get on the scoresheet again in what can be considered to be a failed loan spell.

4 Romeo Lavia Southampton to Chelsea

After playing a starring role for Southampton last season, Chelsea and Liverpool were in a tug-of-war battle for Belgian ace Romeo Lavia once July hit - and the Blues were the winners of the race. Lavia has, however, since played just 32 minutes of action against Crystal Palace in December - sandwiched between extended periods of unavailability.

Admittedly, the Manchester City youth prospect will likely go on to achieve big things, given he's in the infancy of his career, but many of the club's fanbase were expecting him to aid their charge for top four credentials this term. Still just 20 years of age, the one-cap Belgium international has plenty of time to recover.

5 Mason Mount Chelsea to Manchester United

Having spent £60 million on his services in the summer, those associated with the Old Trafford outfit had high expectations of the Cobham graduate. For the west Londoners, his best body of work came from him being stationed in the behind-the-striker role, but his current employers already have Bruno Fernandes to perform that role.

Related Ranking every player to wear number 7 For Manchester United Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham are just two stars who have worn Manchester United's most iconic shirt.

Instead, when fit, Mason Mount has been used as a make-shift central midfielder. As alluded to, his injury-struck campaign has limited the impact he's had on proceedings at Old Trafford, with him managing to weigh in with just one goal in 14 league outings. The former Chelsea man will be keen to hit the ground running in 2024/25 - as will his side's manager.

6 Beto Udinese to Everton

Everton failed to score in their first three Premier League outings. As a result, Sean Dyche and his recruitment team dove back into the market to ensnare Beto from Udinese after his 10-goal showing for the Italian side in 2022/23. That said, he's scored just three goals in 30 Premier League outings, while he's statistically also been one of the worst finishers in the division.

Adjusting to life in England has been somewhat troubling for the Portuguese striker, despite his sizeable frame, and that may come down to his toothlessness in front of goal. Unfortunately for the Goodison Park faithful, he has been far from the answer. Fortunately, Dominic Calvert-Lewin began to find form in the dying embers of the campaign.

7 Matheus Nunes Wolverhampton Wanderers to Manchester City

Plenty of fans were excited about the signing of Matheus Nunes, largely thanks to Guardiola calling him ""one of the world's best players"". Arriving from Wolverhampton Wanderers for £53 million, the Portuguese midfielder has started only seven Premier League games since his career-defining switch.

GIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: From Matheus Nunes' seven starts, five of them have come against sides in the bottom six of the Premier League.

Perhaps not boasting the same level of technicality, a much-needed trait to play for the perennial champions, seen from some of his teammates, 25-year-old Nunes has spent the majority of his season in east Manchester being an eternal substitute. And heading into next season, he'll need to impress to ensure that is not the case again.

8 Sofyan Amrabat Fiorentina to Manchester United

Looking to alleviate their problems in midfield, Manchester United opted to save money by signing Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat on a temporary basis. In terms of the Moroccan international, who shone for his nation at the 2022 World Cup, his sporadic game time hasn't given him enough time.

When he has featured for Ten Hag, however, he simply doesn't look cut out for the trials and tribulations of the Premier League and is 'out of his depth'. Too slow and lethargic, it's no surprise that Manchester United will not be signing him permanently in the summer. Having to play in a litany of different positions hasn't helped the 27-year-old's case, admittedly, but he's been a liability.

9 Armando Broja Fulham to Chelsea (on loan)

At the start of the season, Armando Broja remained at Stamford Bridge as the club's only standout option to lead the line but netted just once in 13 Premier League appearances, all while dealing with his own personal injury matters. By the time January strolled around, both. Fulham and Wolves were in the mix for his signature - and the former were victorious.

Related Exclusive: Wolves Also 'Interested' in £35m Striker on top of Che Adams Wolverhampton Wanderers are considering upping the ante in their pursuit of Armando Broja if his price tag decreases

The Albanian striker has played a paltry 80 minutes for the Cottages since his winter move with him playing second - and even third - fiddle to Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz. Still contracted to Chelsea until the summer of 2028, Mauricio Pochettino and his entourage will certainly be looking for suitors in the summer.

10 James Trafford Manchester City to Burnley

James Trafford's performances between the posts during the 2023 Under-21 European Championships didn't go unnoticed by Burnley boss Vincent Kompany. A string of outstanding stops saw him move to Turf Moor - in a deal worth £19 million - with a chance at becoming Manchester City's number one not on the horizon.

Widely regarded as one of the most disappointing players of the 2023/24 season, Premier League life hasn't been kind to the 21-year-old, and he was dropped by Kompany in March in favour of Arijanet Muric - and, well, Trafford hasn't played since. The Clarets won just three times in his 28 league appearances this season, while the Greysouthen-born ace kept just two clean sheets and conceded 62 goals.

11 Giovanni Reyna Borussia Dortmund to Nottingham Forest (on loan)

In dire need of some minutes, Borussia Dortmund fringe player Giovanni Reyna opted for a summer switch to Nottingham Forest, though it hasn't gone swimmingly for the United States international. Falling out of favour under Edin Terzic was bad enough, but the fact that he's featured some scarcely for the struggling Tricky Trees is another damning indication.

Across his five months in Nottingham, Reyna has played just 230 minutes, registering the solitary assist in that time frame. In what can be filed away as a 'transfer to forget, it's not unfair to outright suggest that Nuno Espirito Santo will not be rushing to sign him on a permanent deal.

12 Rob Holding Arsenal to Crystal Palace

An experienced head with 162 Arsenal appearances on his CV, the fact that Crystal Palace acquired Rob Holding's signature for just £2 million was deemed somewhat of a bargain for the south Londoners. Stalybridge-born Holding, however, has struggled to dislodge the likes of Joachim Andersen and Chris Richards from their place in the team.

Even with Marc Guehi unavailable for a large chunk of the season, the 28-year-old has been reduced to just 90 minutes of action in the League Cup: a 3-0 defeat to Manchester United in which saw him pick up a yellow card. With Palace flourishing towards the end of the season, under Oliver Glasner, the writing could be on the wall for the Englishman.

13 Ryan Gravenberch Ajax to Liverpool

Undoubtedly snared with his future contributions firmly in mind, Ryan Gravenberch has endured a tumultuous season at Anfield - one that marks Jurgen Klopp's last one as boss of the club. Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham was their main midfield target, but they settled for the young Dutchman in a time of dire need.

The Amsterdam-born star has 26 Premier League appearances to his name, though only one of those resulted in a full 90-minute cameo: April's away meeting with West Ham. Still just 21 years of age, the former Ajax has years aplenty left in the tank and, under new management next season, will begin to come into his own no doubt.

14 Nicolo Zaniolo Galatasaray to Aston Villa (on loan)

Before arriving at Villa Park, Nicolo Zaniolo's career path was slightly odd. Emerging as one of the best young midfielders in Europe while at AC Milan and Fiorentina, his move to Galatasaray was puzzling - but it wasn't long before he was earning his corn in the Premier League with Unai Emery's well-drilled Aston Villa side.

And while the Midlands-based outfit have been waxed lyrical about all season - it's hardly any of Zaniolo's doing. The 11-cap Italy international has a mere two goals to boot in his 25 league outings since joining on a loan deal in the summer of 2023. As a result of his substandard return, Zaniolo is set to return to Turkey after failing to meet the standards expected of the now-Champions League side with Emery looking to sign Nico Williams as a replacement.

15 Ibrahim Sangare PSV Eindhoven to Nottingham Forest

From a Nottingham Forest fanbase point of view, there are obvious divisions. Some are under the assumption that Ibrahim Sangare, amid a season of struggles, has shown glimpses of his capabilities since his fanfare-driven arrival. Others, however, believe a Europa League-proven player should bring some level of consistency along with him.

Capped 36 times by the Ivory Coast, there's no doubting the talent and expertise of Sangare, but his lack of minutes since returning from AFCON 2024 is certainly a cause for concern.

19:02KEY EVENTKlopp shows empty office

Jurgen Klopp has given a sneak peak into his empty Liverpool office as he prepares to depart the club.

Speaking on Instagram, the German showed his near-empty office and said: ""So, here I am, the last day in the office. Last session done, it was kind of strange I would say.

""A few of the coaches got quite emotional, I didn't yet. I told myself tomorrow the game and after that, it's holiday.

""Obviously, I decide what I think until I get overwhelmed tomorrow. So, I will leave this place today which is an interesting experience I would say - here are the boxes. See you tomorrow.""

18:32Daniel OrmeEx-Man City star hails Klopp

Former Man City star Shay Given has admitted that he would have 'loved' to have played for Jurgen Klopp.

Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""What I was going to mention is what he's brought to the Premier League, his personality.

""When he first came, we're talking about him on TV or whatever, he's someone as an ex-player I'd love to have played for. He's got that personality that you want to run through walls for, or a tackle.""

17:56Daniel OrmeLijnders hails Klopp influence

Klopp's trusted ally Pep Lijnders has hailed the German's teachings as he prepares for his job with Red Bull Salzburg.

He said: ""At Liverpool, they asked me back after NEC - and I would never have done it if I had only been asked back as No 2 on the staff.

""Over the past six years, I have been given a lot of responsibility. Jurgen made me do press conferences, match discussions. Everything he does himself. He always says 'we do this job together' - and that's really how it is. I know I'm well prepared.""

17:25Daniel OrmeKlopp's final demand ignored

Despite Jurgen Klopp's lifelong lofty status at Liverpool, the German's final club request has been turned down.

Klopp was keen to see Joel Matip - who will also be leaving the club - offered a new deal. He said: ""I'm pretty sure the club will show their class, just how they should do. I'm pretty sure the club told Joel already that whatever happens so long as he is injured.

""Now we have to make decisions together with Joel, how it looks after that. That's a normal thing to do. But yes he deserves all the support from us and he will get it.""

Asked if that meant the club would give him a new contract, Klopp replied: ""I would say so but it's not my decision in the end. I cannot sign the paper.""

16:54Tom VictorFormer Reds star James compares Slot with Klopp

""Everything I've read says this is a very decent guy, very similar to Jurgen Klopp, very decent as a person,"" James told The BBC's Football News Show.

""I think once you've got that decency it's a lot easier for players to buy in to what it is you want to do, and judging by what he's done at Feyenoord, players buy in to what he's wants to do. So it seems like a perfect fit at the beginning.""

16:19Tom VictorSalah plans to stay in touch with Klopp 'for life'

Mohamed Salah has shared his true feelings about Jurgen Klopp, making it clear he is still very fond of the German despite their recent spat during the draw at West Ham.

""As a human being, as a person, if I am in trouble I can speak to him and ask as a person,"" Salah said.

""I think we will keep the communication for sure forever, for life.

""Because it is not just a relationship with work, we also take it outside and we are going to stay in contact forever.""

15:55Tom VictorDe Zerbi leaving Brighton

Roberto De Zerbi, one of the candidates to replace Jurgen Klopp before Liverpool chose Arne Slot, will leave Brighton this summer.

Sunday's match against Manchester United will be the Italian's last in charge, with Bayern Munich among the clubs linked with a swoop.

""I am very sad to be leaving Brighton, but I am very proud of what my players and staff have achieved with the support of everyone at the club and our amazing fans in the past two historical seasons,"" he said.

""We have agreed to end my time at Brighton so that the club and I can continue to work in the way that suits each of us best, following our own ideas and visions, as well as our work and human values.

""I have really enjoyed an intense and challenging two years working in the Premier League, not least competing in four major competitions this season. Leaving now provides me with time to take a break before deciding on my future plans.""

15:18Tom VictorKlopp launches Instagram account

One of the less anticipated parts of the next stage of Jurgen Klopp's life is a move onto Instagram.

13:58Tom VictorReason why Amorim move collapsed

According to Sky Sports, Liverpool's efforts to replace Jurgen Klopp with Ruben Amorim hit a wall over Sporting CP's compensation demands.

The Portuguese club are reported to have asked for £17.2m to part ways with their manager, substantially more than the £9.4m the Reds are understood to be paying for Arne Slot.

Amorim, who was also linked with the Bayern Munich job, is now set to stay at Sporting after securing the Primeira Liga title this season.

13:18Tom VictorMore from Slot on his Feyenoord farewell

""Until now I was not thinking about this being the build-up to my last match, but that starts coming now,"" Arne Slot said ahead of his final game as Feyenoord manager before taking over at Liverpool

""At the beginning of the week you are thinking about training and those kind of things, but the feeling gets stronger now,"" he added.

""That is why I'm a little bit late now [to speak to the media], because I wanted to say goodbye to some people personally and take time for them, more than just shaking hands.

""I understand that good results help, but it is very nice to feel that people really are thinking it's a pity that I'm leaving.""

12:44Tom VictorAlisson ready for emotional Klopp farewell

Liverpool keeper Alisson knows Sunday's match against Wolves will be an emotional time as everyone at the club gets ready to say goodbye to Jurgen Klopp.

""I [can] tell by myself these moments are not so easy to deal with; to say goodbyes,"" the Brazilian told club media.

""But everybody will be on that mood [and] really emotional. I think you get emotional when you realise how good was the spirit [and] how good was the journey.

""The gaffer gave the opportunity not only for the players to be part of this successful team, but he gave [that] to the supporters as well.

""He made the supporters feel part of that. I think that's why everybody will be so emotional.""

11:58Tom VictorGerrard wants Klopp statue at Anfield

Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes outgoing boss Jurgen Klopp deserves a permanent statue outside Anfield.

""I just hope to God that there is a statue in the making and I hope it is nearly ready because he deserves that stature at the club,"" Gerrard told Sky Sports (via The Echo).

""You mention Shankly, Paisley, Fagan, Benitez, all the ones who have won the big prizes at Liverpool, that comes with big pressure and they are very difficult to achieve, those big accolades. He is right up there alongside the best, for sure.""

11:18Tom VictorFeyenoord in action on Sunday

With Arne Slot confirming his Liverpool move, he - like Klopp - will have a farewell game this weekend.

The good news for Liverpool fans is they can watch their new boss before their own team take to the field against Wolves.

Feyenoord, who have second place guaranteed, take on an Excelsior side who could secure safety if results go their way.

10:38Tom VictorLijnders explains important Klopp input

Pep Lijnders believes Jurgen Klopp's influence has prepared him well for his next job at Red Bull Salzburg.

Lijnders returned to Liverpool after a short spell in charge at NEC, but will leave this summer despite some hoping he'd stay at Anfield after Klopp's exit.

""I take away that without that period [at NEC] I would never have been able to help Liverpool and Klopp, as I have done in the last six years,"" the 41-year-old told Algemeen Dagblad (via Sport Witness).

""I already knew what it was like to be ultimately responsible for the youth teams of PSV, Porto and Liverpool. But not yet from a first team at professional level. At Liverpool they asked me back after NEC, but I would never have done it if I had only been asked back as 'number 2' in the staff.

""Over the past six years I have been given a lot of responsibility. Jurgen has let me do press conferences, match talks. Everything he does himself. ""We do this job together"", he always says. And that's how it really is. I know I am well prepared.""

09:58Tom VictorICYMI: Slot confirms Liverpool move

Arne Slot's impending move to Liverpool was already an open secret, but now it's official.

""I can confirm that I will become the trainer there next season,"" the Feyenoord boss said on Friday.

Whoever Liverpool chose to replace Klopp was bound to have a big task ahead, and many will be excited to see how Slot deals with the pressure.

09:18KEY EVENTKlopp's open letter to the people of Liverpool

Before his final game in charge, Jurgen Klopp has written an open letter to the people of Liverpool.

Published in The Echo, it sees the manager outline how important it is to say goodbye personally, and outlines the bond he has with the city as well as the club.

""For me, Liverpool is the city of open arms,"" Klopp writes.

""A place that welcomes you like a son and does not care where you come from.

""It just wants you to be part of it and I could not be prouder that you allowed me to have that incredible privilege.

""A city that gives this kind of welcome deserves at the very least a proper farewell.""

09:12Tom VictorGood morning

We'll have all the build-up to Sunday's match against Wolves, as well as other updates after Arne Slot confirmed he'll take over at Anfield.

Stay with us throughout the day for everything you need.

22:40Samuel MeadeGood night

That's all from us - we'll be back tomorrow as we close in on the final day of the Premier League.

21:41Samuel MeadeSavage's take on Klopp

The former Premier League player said in his Mirror column: ""In another era, Jurgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta would have won more trophies - but they have found themselves competing with Pep Guardiola, an all-time great.

""By the same token, Andy Murray would have won far more than three Grand Slam tournaments in tennis if he didn't have Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic as his rivals. But that's the nature of sport: You can only beat what's in front of you, and sometimes the opponents in front of you are just too strong.""

20:09Samuel MeadeThe Klopp lovin' just keeps on coming 19:00Samuel MeadeSlot told to pick VVD over Salah

Liverpool great Mark Lawrenson believes Virgil van Dijk should be the player Arne Slot prioritises when it comes down to getting a new contract sorted - not Mohamed Salah.

The Dutchman has confirmed he will head to Anfield as Jurgen Klopp's replacement and has several major decisions to make as the club enter a new era. Van Dijk and Salah proved to be two of the most influential signings during the German's tenure but both face uncertain futures.

The centre-half has his contract winding down whilst Salah, who clashed with Klopp in recent weeks, has been linked with a switch to Saudi Arabia. That move could yet materialise with Liverpool facing a big decision on whether or not they choose to cash in on the Egyptian.

Salah's form has dipped in recent months and Lawrenson believes the club should be open minded when it comes to allowing their forward, who would command a hefty fee, to depart with Van Dijk's immediate future far more important to their chances of success.

17:29Samuel MeadeThe tributes continue to pour in

The emotion is on the rise ahead of Jurgen Klopp's farewell on Sunday and they've released a video on their social media account.

16:15KEY EVENTBREAKING - Slot confirms he will replace Klopp

Arne Slot has confirmed that he will be the next Liverpool manager - succeeding Jurgen Klopp.

The German announced he would be departing Anfield at the start of the year and the search has been ongoing regarding his successor. Xabi Alonso was the early favourite but Liverpool quickly diverted away from the Bayer Leverkusen boss and Slot became a leading contender.

He has won honours with Feyenoord and has been linked with Premier League jobs in the past. Now he will leave the Dutch outfit and confirmed himself that he would move to Liverpool.

With games happening across multiple continents and time zones, finding reliable broadcasting options is crucial. The English Premier League, Spain's La Liga, Italy's Serie A, and Germany's Bundesliga are among the most popular.

But opportunities also exist to watch the Dutch Eredivisie, France's Ligue 1, and Latin America's top competitions like the Primera División. For those seeking 해외축구중계사이트 (overseas soccer broadcasting sites), numerous online platforms have emerged to stream matches live. However, accessing official rights-held broadcasts ensures higher quality.

Let's dive into exploring which major overseas soccer leagues provide legitimate live broadcasting options.

Premier League (England)

The Premier League is the top professional soccer league in England and one of the most viewed world sports programs anywhere on the earth. The league boasts English powerhouses such as Manchester United, Liverpool, and Chelsea and that makes it one of the most-watched football leagues all over the world. For example, less popular countries like USA NBC Sports, UK Sky Sports, and Africa SuperSport offer wide reviews of live games. Besides this, fans can also stream matches through the league's official streaming service or on licensed online platforms by Peacock, fuboTV, and others. The fact that the Premier League can be viewed across the globe means that many viewers can access live England action.

La Liga (Spain)

Spain's Primera División is the common nomenclature for La Liga that boasts super clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Atlético Madrid. It has enriched the best for many years and acted as an arena for tactical and entertaining football. The Big broadcasters who broadcast La Liga include BeIN Sports (the USA), Premiere Sports(the UK), and Super Sport (Africa) The competition owns LaLigaSportTV, another OTT platform, where live streaming is available in many markets. That worldwide icons like Karim Benzema and Robert Lewandowski play here makes La Liga exciting matches every week.

Serie A (Italy)

Besides, it is the Serie A league of Italy which has a rich tradition characterized by such strong clubs as Juventus and AC Milan. If not as worldwide mighty as a few decades ago, it is still a league of titans that attracts purists around the globe. Paramount+ (USA), BT Sport (UK), and SuperSport (Africa) are among the top networks showcasing Serie A live games live. The league has similarly focused on strengthening its global streaming reach using partnerships with major platforms such as CBS Sports and Vix+. It becomes so fascinating to watch emerging stars like Victor Osimhen and Paulo Dybala and appreciate the glory of the game by people that know what they are talking about.

Bundesliga (Germany)

The German Bundesliga has managed to gain the status of high, offensive football being next to the heart of the intensive club of Bayern Munich. ESPN+ (USA), Sky Sports (UK), and SuperSport (Africa) are just some of the broadcasting outlets that show live extensively. The League's expensive pricing for international viewers has improved its access wider and wider audience. The Bundesliga's FM accessibility will see the signing of rising local heroes and already-established international talents like Jamal Musiala and Erling Haaland. It has both the atmosphere of the action stadium and the fans who are crazy enough to add more thrill to the show.

Ligue 1 (France)

Ligue 1 from France has emerged as a leading league globally due to the long-term performances of Paris Saint-Germain, the club that has become popular in the soccer world with the roster starring Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi, and Neymar. While the team is brutal and brutal, you have much more than PSG's reverberating attack. Historical rivals like Marseille, Lyon, and Monaco guarantee thrilling and tough championship competition. Large companies such as beIN Sports (US/Canada), BT Sport (UK), and SuperSport (Africa) televise Ligue 1 games as live broadcasts. Online platforms like FuboTV have followed suit in this respect and also acquired rights in some markets. The distinct mix of style, speed, and whatever the technical level is Ligue One brings to the viewers an entertaining kind of game that viewers worldwide can enjoy.

Eredivisie (Netherlands)

Although it may not have the bling of elite Europe leagues it deserves to be recognized for its enterprising approach to the game and the production of talented young players. Clubs such as Ajax, PSV Eindhoven, and Feyenoord are notorious for shaping players who eventually make it to the biggest stages of the most esteemed soccer competitions around the globe. Amongst those, are ESPN+ (U.S.) as the main distributor of Eredivisie, Premier Sports (UK) and SuperSport (Africa) are other important broadcasters. In addition, the league is currently negotiating with out-of-market online platforms to increase OTT accessibility. Being able to see the textbook system of total Football is a reward in itself.

Primera División (Argentina/Mexico)

La Primera División is the term that is used to denote the top divisions in the soccer game, which is in Argentina and Mexico. With the league boasting big names like Boca Juniors, River Plate, and Racing who have been widely known in South American football, Argentina's league will always win fans over. In the country of Mexico, it is the Chivas, América, and Cruz Azul that fuel the national interest. Unarguably, among the weaknesses of these leagues is their global reach relative to the European leagues of which their diasporas look for live transmission every year. Examples of such platforms are FuboTV, Fanatiz, and Argentina's TNT Sports which are practically streaming across the whole of America Primera División coverage.

Russian Premier League

Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the Russian Premier League had been implementing its strategy of marketing itself as well as adopting different tactics to various overseas viewers. Yet, that force has faced a sharp interruption as a result of strife and sanctions. The online-streaming editions however still broadcast RPL matches for the followers interested in following the success of clubs like FC Zenit and FC Spartak. The lengthy presence of the RPL in the arena of Russian space policy is uncertain as tensions and geopolitics seem to be hindering its foreign business prospects. People who can legally get into it might learn how that nation's soccer culture is represented through the league.

Nineteen-year-old centre-back Reuell Walters is considered one of the top prospects in the Gunners' Hale End academy system, coming up with one goal and two assists in 23 games for the youth team this season.

Walters has already trained with Mikel Arteta's first team and made matchday squads in the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup and EFL Cup, but he has never played for the senior side competitively.

There was hope that the England Under-20 international would have made his debut in December's Champions League dead rubber with PSV Eindhoven, but to Gooners' chagrin, he was an unused substitute in that 1-1 draw.

Having failed to force his way into Arteta's side despite his best efforts, The Athletic reports that Walters will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of the season.

Walters 'rejects Arsenal contract offer'

The Gunners apparently had high hopes for the former Tottenham Hotspur youngster and offered him a contract extension, but Walters rejected their proposal.

The Englishman supposedly believes that staying in North London would not be the best move for his career, although Arsenal are stressing that his departure has been mutually agreed.

Walters is not believed to be short of interest, as teams in England's top two tiers, Belgium, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy are all thought to be battling for his signature.

Arsenal will pocket just over £300,000 in training compensation should Walters - who has a German passport - join a foreign club, but if he continues his career in England, the Gunners can determine the amount of monies received.

The 19-year-old has been free to hold talks with teams elsewhere in Europe since entering the last six months of his deal, and he will be able to discuss a move to another English party this weekend.

Which players could follow Walters out of Arsenal?

While Walters's exit is particularly disappointing for Arsenal fans who never got a glimpse of the talented defender in senior action, his motivations for moving are understandable given that he has never earned his competitive debut for the first team.

The Gunners are also yet to make a breakthrough in discussions with winger Amario Cozier-Duberry, while academy goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo has already confirmed his imminent departure when his deal runs out.

Experienced pair Cedric Soares and Mohamed Elneny are in the same boat, as are two other shot-stoppers in Aaron Ramsdale and Karl Hein, the former of whom will become a free agent in June.

Bids should also be entertained for Reiss Nelson, Emile Smith Rowe, Eddie Nketiah, Nuno Tavares, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Kieran Tierney, while Thomas Partey - soon to enter the last year of his contract - is still being linked with a move away too.

The future of Gabriel Jesus has been a hotly-debated topic too, but Arsenal dropped a hint over both his and Ramsdale's futures in the launch of their new home kit for the 2024-25 season.

The Telegraaf reported that the Amsterdammers were ready to offer the 35-year-old Italian a three-year contract to succeed Maurice Steijn, who left in October with the club at the bottom of the Eredivisie.

Farioli has never played the game at professional level, but has made an impact during his short managerial career in Turkey and with French top flight side Nice.

He was approached by head of scouting Kelvin de Lang and director of football Marijn Beuker after Ajax's first choices - former boss Erik ten Hag, now at Manchester United, and former Chelsea manager Graham Potter - turned the job down.

The Cote d'Azur-based club are said to be prepared to negotiate a compensation deal for Farioli once the league season finishes next weekend.

Farioli was not an obvious choice for a club that said it wanted to appoint an experienced ""preferably Dutch"" coach with ""Ajax DNA"" to steady the ship after a turbulent season.

But he is said to have impressed Ajax's technical staff with his training methods, his work ethic and attacking philosophy.

Farioli cites Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola and former Ajax legend Johan Cruyff as his inspirations. He studied philosophy and sports science at the University of Florence and was a goalkeeping coach in Italy before beginning his managerial career in the Turkish Super League at the age of 31.

He will be in the spotlight from day one at the Johan Cruyff Arena, where fans will expect rapid progress after a season in which they fell well short of expectations.

Maurice Steijn quit in October after managing just two wins in his 12 competitive matches, while rivals and eventual champions PSV won their first nine league games.

The club also sacked director of football Sven Mislintat amid allegations of a conflict of interest over his signing of players, though a subsequent investigation concluded he had done nothing wrong.

Former player John van 't Schip took the reins after Steijn's departure until the end of the season and steered the club to a fifth-placed finish, its lowest position for 24 years.

Ajax suffered a further setback in March when new CEO Alex Kroes was forced to step down when it emerged he had bought shares in the club a week before his appointment was made public.

The club's supervisory board moved to sack Kroes after taking legal advice that said he had ""likely engaged in insider trading"", sparking an outcry among shareholders.

Kroes accepted the newly created role of technical director, but his share deal is under investigation by the Dutch financial regulator AFM and the club says it will reconsider his position if he is found to have broken the rules.",dutchnews.nl,news,DutchNews.nl,Gordon Darroch,0.2470588235294118,453456753,1,https://www.dutchnews.nl/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ANP-498114272-scaled.jpg,

From Christian Pulisic's impressive first Serie A campaign to Haji Wright's productive season with Coventry City and Malik Tillman's stellar loan spell with PSV, there was plenty for American soccer fans to be excited about heading into a busy international summer schedule.

Weston McKennie answered the call in his return to Juventus while Chris Richards took a major step forward in his development.

Gabriel Slonina made the most appearances among USMNT goalkeepers in Europe this season, setting himself up for a tougher challenge next season.

Here is a closer look at SBI's Best XI for the past international season:

Gabriel Slonina entered the 2023-24 campaign needing to play regularly to help his overall development and the U.S. men's national team goalkeeper did just that in Belgium.

Slonina, 19, registered five clean sheets in 34 combined appearances this season for Eupen. Despite the club's consistent struggles and eventual relegation to the second-tier, Slonina was one of the lone bright spots in their season.

Now Slonina prepares for potential Olympic involvement and a new challenge at club level next season.

PSV ended the 2023-24 campaign as Eredivisie champions and Sergino Dest was a major reason for their success.

Dest logged over 3,100 minutes in 37 combined appearances for PSV, scoring two goals and adding seven assists. The USMNT full back mainly featured on the left side of Peter Bosz's squad, delivering a stellar loan spell from Barcelona.

Despite suffering a torn ACL this spring, Dest was one of the bright spots in the PSV squad and will hope to carry that confidence into next year.

Borussia Moenchengladbach's Joe Scally excelled for the Bundesliga side, featuring on both sides of the backline and playing a consistent role in the squad.

Sheffield United's forgettable English Premier League campaign shouldn't take away from Auston Trusty's first season with the club.

Trusty was a consistent starter for the Blades this season, logging 31 league appearances to date and totaling over 2,400 minutes. After transferring from Arsenal last summer, Trusty jumped right into the squad and rarely lost his place under two different managers.

Whether or not Trusty stays with Sheffield United in the Championship remains to be seen, but if he does, he has a strong chance of remaining a starter next campaign.

Chris Richards took a major step forward in his role with Crystal Palace this season.

The 24-year-old centerback featured as both a defender and defensive midfielder in the Eagles squad. Richards made 25 appearances for the South London club, scoring his first Premier League goal and also adding his first assist.

Richards retained his spot following Oliver Glasner's arrival at Selhurst Park and has a strong chance of staying a key player in the squad for 2024-25.

Cameron Carter-Vickers might've been in-and-out of the Celtic squad this season, but he's remained a consistent starter when healthy for the eventual Scottish Premiership winners.

A career-best year for Antonee Robinson earned him a spot in this season's Best XI.

Robinson missed just one Premier League match for Fulham this season, registering six assists, and being a strong two-way player for the Cottagers. Despite interest from both Manchester City and Liverpool, Robinson committed his long-term future to the club and remains one of the consistent starters at his position among Premier League left backs.

Domestic and European interest will likely come once again this summer, but expect Robinson to stay in London going forward.

Kristoffer Lund's impressive first season with Palermo didn't go un-noticed as the USMNT defender helped them earn a spot in the Serie B promotion playoffs.

One of the more consistent midfielders in Italy's Serie B division, Tanner Tessmann will be one to watch this summer.

Tessmann scored six goals and added three assists in 37 league appearances for Venezia. The former FC Dallas homegrown featured often for the third-place finishers, teaming up with fellow American Gianluca Busio on a regular basis.

Should Venezia not earn promotion via the playoffs, Tessmann could be on the radar for a jump to a Top 5 league this summer.

Gianluca Busio also impressed for Venezia, netting seven goals and adding four assists alongside Tessmann. He was an Honorable Mention for this spot.

Weston McKennie returned to Juventus last summer with plenty of questions to answer and the USMNT star did just that this season.

McKennie registered 10 assists in all competitions, making 37 combined appearances in all competitions. The 25-year-old showed off his versatility, featuring in midfield, and as a wing back at times.

Juventus still has a Coppa Italia trophy to play for, which could be the best ending to the season for them.

Johnny Cardoso's impact with both Internacional and Real Betis earned him an Honorable Mention shout this season.

A second-straight loan spell for Malik Tillman earned him a permanent move to Dutch side PSV.

Tillman totaled nine goals and 15 assists in all competitions for the Eredivisie champions, excelling in Peter Bosz's squad. Despite signing a contract extension with Bayern Munich last summer, Tillman's productive loan spell earned him a transfer to Holland permanently.

The 21-year-old can still grow his game even more and Tillman will certainly aim for that this summer with the USMNT.

Griffin Yow delivered in so many levels for Belgian side Westerlo this season. Yow, 21, scored seven goals and added seven assists this season, taking a huge step forward in his development.

Christian Pulisic's permanent move to AC Milan brought immediate pressure on the USMNT star and the creative attacker answered the call in a big way.

Pulisic totaled 16 goals and nine assists in 49 combined appearances for the Rossoneri, making an immediate impact in the squad. AC Milan did not walk away with a trophy in 2023-24, but Pulisic did help Stefano Pioli's squad clinch a spot in next season's UEFA Champions League.

Up next is two final league matches before USMNT involvement at the Copa America.

Emmanuel Sabbi's jump to his biggest challenge yet featured many impressive moments in Ligue 1. Sabbi totaled five goals and one assist for Le Havre, being a creative spark in the final third.

Haji Wright entered the season with plenty of questions coming his way and the American forward certainly answered them in style.

Wright was tied for the club lead at Coventry City with 19 goals scored across all competitions. While many players would've had a rough transition to the English game, Wright flourished in Mark Robins' squad, helping the Sky Blues reach the FA Cup Semifinals and finish in the top half of the EFL Championship.

Wright's productive season saw him return to the USMNT squad and lift a CONCACAF Nations League title.

Ricardo Pepi scored nine goals for PSV despite being a substitute for most of his appearances this season. Pepi will fight for a starting role next season as PSV returns to the Champions League and aims for domestic dominance in Holland.

Josh Sargent might have missed three months this season but it didn't stop him from setting new career-highs with Norwich City.

Sargent scored 16 goals for the Canaries in 29 combined appearances, helping David Wagner's men reach the EFL Championship promotion playoffs. His 2024 form alone should have him in the USMNT conversation this summer for the Copa America.

Sargent will be on the radar of several clubs this summer, especially if Norwich doesn't earn promotion.

Alex Zendejas registered double-digit goals for the second-straight season, continuing his impactful run with Club America. Zendejas totaled 15 goals and eight assists in 50 combined appearances.

However, if you take a look at the dugouts around the Champions League, Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and Primeira Liga, you'll see a whole crop of coaches who could one day be the next world-famous figureheads of elite teams.

Some have already won league titles and major trophies with their current clubs, while others have shown they can compete with, and even beat, the traditional powerhouses despite working with less-heralded players and fewer resources. They might have taken all the knowledge and wisdom gleaned from the world's best coaches during glittering playing careers and applied it successfully to their own managerial styles, or they could have soaked up all they know from the sideline having failed to make the grade on the pitch.

But all of them have put themselves in the conversation for a job at one or more of the biggest clubs in Europe whenever they make their next moves. Who will replace Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich this summer? Or fill the shoes of Carlo Ancelotti when he inevitably steps down as Real Madrid boss?

Here is a look at Slot and 10 other managers who could soon be joining him at football's top table, with details on their signature styles of play, their biggest achievements to date and which clubs they have already been linked with.

Style of play: Attacking football with a lot of movement, a high defensive line and a lot of possession in a 3-4-2-1 formation most of the time.

Biggest achievement to date: Have you watched Leverkusen this season? Alonso & Co. won the Bundesliga title this year with a few games to spare in his first full season as a manager. His team is also in the German Cup final and the Europa League final later this month while still unbeaten in 50 games so far this season.

Clubs linked with: Liverpool and Bayern Munich wanted him badly, while Real Madrid eye him as the successor of Carlo Ancelotti when he will decide to leave. But Alonso chose to stay at Leverkusen for at least another season.

Since Pep Guardiola, we have never seen a manager be so successful in his first full season at a top club. While Guardiola had Lionel Messi and a stellar squad to call upon at Barcelona, Xabi Alonso pretty much had to do it all himself. He took over at the Bayer Arena from Gerardo Seoane when the team was 17th in the table in October 2022 and in crisis. Prior to joining, he'd only managed the Real Sociedad reserve team by then (with mixed results and an average points per game of 1.5 and a 40% win ratio), though his reputation and stock were both sky-high.

When you were one of the best players of your generation with one of the highest football IQs, and you'd been coached by Rafael Benitez, José Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti during your career, you may have seemed destined to becoming a top manager like Mourinho himself tipped Alonso to be. And it's fair to say he's already making history with this incredible 2023-24 season.

His team plays an exciting style of football that he has perfectly implemented with his squad. His recruitment (Victor Boniface, Ale Grimaldo, Granit Xhaka, Nathan Tella, to name just four) has been great, and he's drilled into his squad the same spirit that Alonso himself displayed when Liverpool won the Champions League in Istanbul back in 2005. Leverkusen have been the kings of late goals and late comebacks this season thanks to the mentality instilled by their fantastic manager. -- Julien Laurens

Style of play: Amorim is committed to a 3-4-3 system, anchored at the back by former Liverpool defender Sebastián Coates, with wing-backs expected to cover the entirety of their flanks. In midfield, Amorim deploys two box-to-box midfielders behind a front three led by a traditional No. 9. This season, Sweden forward Viktor Gyökeres has helped to deliver the Portuguese title with 27 goals and 10 assists in 32 games.

Biggest achievement to date: Amorim ended Sporting's 19-year wait for a domestic title in 2020-21 and broke the Benfica-Porto duopoly in the Primeira Liga. He has backed that up by winning the title again this season.

Clubs linked with: Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, West Ham United

Amorim is the rising star of Portuguese coaching and is tipped to follow the likes of José Mourinho, André Villas-Boas, Marco Silva and Nuno Espírito Santo by securing a job in one of Europe's most high-profile leagues. The former Benfica and Portugal midfielder said this month that he was committed to one more season at Sporting after guiding the team to the Primeira Liga title. But having been high on the wanted list of Liverpool and West Ham, Amorim could yet be prised away from the Lisbon club this summer if a team is prepared to pay his €15m release clause.

Amorim is a strong character all too willing to defy authority. During his playing days at Benfica, he clashed with coach Jorge Jesus over team selection and refused to train with the nonplaying squad. During his first coaching job at third-tier Casa Pia, Amorim was given a one-year suspension by the Portuguese Football Federation for giving match instructions without having the coaching qualifications to do so; although the suspension was subsequently lifted, he resigned from his post.

His big break came with Braga, where he won the Taça de Portugal in 2021 with victory against Porto in the final before Sporting triggered a €10m release clause to hire him as coach. Amorim's eye for talent saw Sporting sign Pedro Porro, João Palhinha and João Mário before ending the club's lengthy title drought. Amorim also won the domestic cup again with Sporting, and was sent to the stands for arguing with opposition coach Carlos Carvalhal on the touchline.

Amorim's success in overcoming Benfica and Porto to establish Sporting as Portugal's top team has made him the target of many top clubs, but his refusal to compromise on his 3-4-3 system could prove to be a weakness as much as a strength going forward. -- Mark Ogden

Style of play: Fast, direct, aggressive football, pressing high and keeping a high defensive line. In Portugal's Primeira Liga, Porto dominate possession and play on the front foot, but as they showed against Arsenal in the Champions League this season, they're also willing to be ruthlessly pragmatic.

Biggest achievement to date: Porto hadn't won the league in four years when Conceição took over in 2017, with Benfica threatening to match Porto's record of five in a row. Conceição changed all that. Despite UEFA-imposed Financial Fair Play restrictions that severely limited their ability in the transfer market, Porto won the league at a canter in 2017-18, with two more titles in 2020 and 2022. He has also led them to the Champions League quarterfinals twice, going toe-to-toe with bigger clubs.

Clubs linked with: Conceição was linked to AC Milan in early May. A source told ESPN that he was ready to move from Porto this summer after seven years in charge, targeting a big club in Europe's top five leagues.

Conceição made his name as a hardworking Serie A winger in the late 90s, playing for Lazio as well as Parma and Inter Milan, and working with coaches Sven-Göran Eriksson and Hector Cuper. He starred for Portugal at Euro 2000 and briefly worked under Mourinho at Porto before retiring in 2009 and turning to coaching. After some stormy, brief managerial spells, his time at Porto has been an unequivocal success.

Conceição has won 10 trophies with Porto, a tally only Jorge Jesus can match in Portuguese football, and holds the Portuguese record for most points won in a season, 91. He is demanding, intense and passionate, and that's reflected in his teams. ""Porto are like their coach,"" Diego Simeone -- who also played alongside Conceição at Lazio -- said in 2022. ""They're enthusiastic, they're alive, they're energetic. They're intense in attack and defence. They work together and that makes them competitive.""

Conceição has dealt effectively with Porto's limited resources and often idiosyncratic senior management, helping develop young players who often move to big clubs for a significant profit: think Éder Militão (Real Madrid), Luis Díaz (Liverpool), Fabio Vieira (Arsenal) and Vitinha (PSG), among many others.

Conceição signed a new contract at Porto last month, but a source has told ESPN that he has the right to release himself from that deal if he wishes. He would like to take over a club with a more realistic chance of winning the Champions League, and which has a more clearly defined, professional structure in which the coach can focus on coaching. -- Alex Kirkland

Style of play: As he told ESPN last year, De Zerbi's philosophy is: ""I like to keep the ball, to enjoy the ball, to try every game to be protagonists on the pitch, working with passion, working with ambition and working towards a dream."" Brighton forward Danny Welbeck, meanwhile, says: ""Everybody has to be in sync.""

De Zerbi's formations switch between 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 and 4-2-4, but whichever setup he uses, it revolves around the ability to build up from the back and transition quickly to the opposition box, swarming, pressing and playing with high intensity.

Biggest achievement to date: Guiding Sassuolo into the top eight of Serie A across both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons was a remarkable achievement, but taking Brighton to sixth in the Premier League last season and qualifying them for the Europa League tops the bill.

Clubs linked with: De Zerbi has been linked with most of the top jobs in Europe, from Bayern to Barcelona. His name has also been mentioned in connection with Liverpool, Chelsea (where uncertainty continues to surround Mauricio Pochettino), Juventus and Napoli.

Pep Guardiola has long been a De Zerbi evangelist. When he joined Brighton back in September 2022, Guardiola said the Italian was ""changing many things in English football."" The feeling is mutual; De Zerbi has taken inspiration from Guardiola, too. The players themselves talk about De Zerbi's ability to motivate them and his midmatch tactical tweaks. They see the passion he exudes on the touchline, as well as the ease with which he can shift his teams into different formations. Fundamentally, his teams try to suffocate opponents, building up from the back with Guardiola previously hailing the way De Zerbi's team progresses from goalkeeper to the final third in a blink of an eye.

De Zerbi's playing career saw him start with AC Milan and live a nomadic life on loan across Italy, primarily playing in Serie B. His coaching career began with a short-lived spell at Palermo, but it was at Sassuolo where he earned his reputation by leading them twice to a top-half finish in Serie A. There he lived and slept football, having a notepad by the side of his bed in case some tactical inspiration slipped into a dream.

He joined Shakhtar Donetsk in 2021 but left in July 2022 as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ended up taking charge of Brighton early in the 2022-23 campaign. He led the Seagulls to sixth in the Premier League, qualification for Europa League and last season's FA Cup semifinal.

This season has been a little tougher at Brighton with their squad stretched because of their run to the Europa League round of 16, and they sit in 10th. After their 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth, De Zerbi bemoaned the injuries they've suffered but also the squad's lack of motivation. ""In this moment, too many points from European qualification, we are working for an unclear target, but I can't accept a game without soul,"" he said.

De Zerbi has asked for clarity over his future and the club's ambitions, saying back in March that he was keen to hold talks -- his contract runs through 2026. But then he was vague in April regarding his future. ""I have not decided to leave, it is not the right time yet to decide anything,"" he said. The indication is that Brighton expects him to stay, but the relationship is more strained. His summer prospects are probably dependent on (a) which jobs are available and (b) his relationship with Brighton. -- Tom Hamilton

Style of play: In his first foray into coaching, Farioli developed a reputation in Turkey for risk-filled attacking play. He has shown more defensive acumen since arriving in France in 2023 in an encouraging sign that he is becoming a more balanced coach. The Italian also has shown he likes a 3-4-3 formation, asking his defensive midfielder to drop into the backline as the full-backs push forward.

Biggest achievement to date: Without a doubt becoming the youngest coach in a top-tier European league. At 31 years old, he took over at Fatih Karagümrük in March 2021 before landing a major job, again in Turkey, with Alanyaspor in December of the same year.

Clubs linked with: Farioli has seen his name touted among clubs back in Italy such as Milan and Napoli in addition to elsewhere around Europe, with Ajax and Manchester United also mentioned. Last summer, there were also links with Championship side Sunderland as they looked for a bright young coach to guide their own group of fledglings.

Farioli's first steps into the game were as an assistant to Brighton boss De Zerbi. A member of De Zerbi's technical team at Benevento reached out to Farioli after reading an article he wrote for scouting platform WyScout. De Zerbi initially brought Farioli in as his goalkeeping coach and had him by his side at both Benevento and Sassuolo. Farioli's first proper coaching job came at age 31 with Fatih Karagümrük. There, his ultra-attacking style caught the eye of Alanyaspor, who hired him in December of the same year.

Nice were similarly impressed and placed him in charge of a young first-team squad. Since being at the French club, Farioli has added some defensive nous, though it has come at the expense of some attacking vibrance. Farioli also has shown a desire for his full-backs to not only become inverted (moving centrally and overloading the midfield while in possession) but also provide overlaps, while requiring his goalkeeper and centre-backs to be confident in possession.

Nice went unbeaten this season until December, and they have managed wins away at both Monaco and PSG. They're still in hot contention for European football next season, sitting fifth (and automatic Europa League qualification) with a four-point gap to fourth-place Brest and two games left. (If they can finish fourth, that would put them in the Champions League).

As the man himself stated, ""When Plan A doesn't work, you need a better Plan A,"" confirming Farioli is very much a manager of principles and belief in his philosophy. His coaching influences are also interesting, with Farioli naming the more defensive-minded Arrigo Sacchi and Mourinho as the coaches he looks up to, though he also dropped in his admiration for Guardiola's Barcelona and Johan Cruyff's Ajax. That Farioli has shown his awareness of defending with more responsibility this season, it suggests he is preparing for life at a major club where the demands are greater when it comes to be being flexible tactically. -- David Cartlidge

Style of play: Brentford switch between a 3-5-2 and 4-3-3 formation, both with attacking intentions. They play with pace and verticality, priding themselves on set piece excellence. Under Frank's tactics, their wing-backs get plenty of miles under their belt, not afraid to hit teams on the counter, but are equally adept at focusing play through the middle, with Frank usually favouring a defensive anchor paired with two energetic box-to-box midfielders.

Biggest achievement to date: Brentford's promotion to the Premier League in 2021 was a defining moment with their return to the top flight for the first time in 74 years.

Clubs linked with: Frank has been mentioned as a possible successor to Klopp while also having been named as a possible contender for Manchester United as they weigh up Erik ten Hag's future.

Frank's coaching career started in the youth sides of the Denmark national team setup -- while doubling up as a teacher -- and he worked his way up to managing their under-19 men's team before taking charge of Brøndby in 2013. Over the course of three seasons, he led them into Europe twice before leaving in March 2016. By December of the same year, he was assistant coach at Brentford, charged with bridging the gap between the B team and the first team, before taking over from Dean Smith in October 2018. He led them to the Championship playoff final in 2020 and secured promotion a year later.

In his first season in the Premier League, they finished in 13th. Then they finished ninth last term despite having the lowest wage budget in the league, according to a Capology study. Frank also has adapted brilliantly to Brentford's data-led approach to recruitment, working with the signings brought in. But it is his unflappable nature, his incredible ability to improve players across his squad and his ruthlessly efficient style of high-energy play on the field that has seen him win so many admirers.

""Thomas is a very honest person,"" said Brentford's on-loan left-back Sergio Reguilón. ""I love the way he talks to everyone, to you, the players. I love him.""

Klopp said earlier in the season of Frank: ""He's doing a brilliant job there and seems to be very happy there. A while ago, we had a managers meeting, and he could get there by bike, so he likes life in the area. He's a cool guy. I respect him a lot.""

Frank has managed to weather anything and everything that has been thrown at him, staying calm throughout. ""His strength is his consistency of energy,"" a source told ESPN. ""I'm sure he gets stressed, but he rarely loses it and remains very level-headed.""

That's not to say it's been straightforward. Over the past nine months, he lost first-choice goalkeeper David Raya in the summer and chief goal scorer Ivan Toney to an eight-month suspension for breaching betting rules. But Brentford still have managed to secure their top-flight safety despite having a brutal injury list -- including 29 separate substantial absences for key players -- this season.

Frank is signed up with Brentford through to 2027 and isn't agitating for a move, but it's easy to imagine him somewhere bigger in the future. ""I think we all have kind of an ego, and the ego likes that little bit of sugar, but at the end of the day, I'm at Brentford. I'm very happy here,"" Frank said in February. ""Do I have ambitions? Yes. Am I going to stay at Brentford forever? Maybe, but probably not. What I know is that I'm here at Brentford and I'm very happy with it."" -- Hamilton

Style of play: Lots of verticality, plus quick forward projections and transitions with an aggressive press in a 4-4-2 formation.

Biggest achievement to date: His Stuttgart side is third in the table and he won the third-division title with the Bayern reserve team four years ago.

Clubs linked with: His name was very high on the Bayern Munich shortlist to replace Thomas Tuchel in the summer, but he decided to sign a new deal at Stuttgart.

Hoeneß is not a name easy to carry in Germany. Sebastian will never be the most famous Hoeneß in German football -- that honor goes to his uncle, Uli, for his exploits as a player and Bayern Munich president -- but he is making a (first) name for himself. Outside of Alonso, Hoeneß has been the best coach in the Bundesliga this season, and it's not been close.

After arriving at Stuttgart in April 2023 and finishing 16th, he changed the team and its fortunes completely to make it one of the best in the country. After doing well with the Bayern Munich youth and reserve teams, and a decent first season in charge at Hoffenheim (picking up 1.4 points per game from 2020 to 2022), Stuttgart was a big job, and he rose to the occasion. His team has been super efficient in all areas of the pitch -- in particular their attack, where Serhou Guirassy and Denis Undav have been superb. He made every player improve individually while collectively, his team was resilient and well drilled.

Taking this side into next season's Champions League feels like a trophy for him, though bigger and better things surely await him. Maybe he'll team up with his uncle at Bayern one day, but for now he'll continue building his own path. -- Laurens

Style of play: When McKenna took charge of Ipswich in December 2021, with the team 12th in League One, he made clear his determination to revive the team by instilling a possession-based game at the club. He has retained that philosophy and secured back-to-back promotions.

Biggest achievement to date: McKenna ended Ipswich's 22-year absence from the Premier League by winning promotion from the Championship this season -- an achievement made even more impressive because the team received promotion from League One only 12 months earlier.

Clubs linked with: Brighton, Celtic, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Manchester United.

Having progressed through the youth ranks at Tottenham Hotspur, McKenna was forced to retire at the age of 22 without making a senior appearance as a result of a hip injury. Determined to make a career in football, the Northern Irishman earned a sports science degree at Loughborough University before working as a youth team coach at Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Leicester and the Vancouver Whitecaps.

McKenna returned to Spurs, moving through the coaching ranks to become head of the club's under-18 teams until he was hired by Manchester United to assume the same role at Old Trafford. His work with the United youngsters caught the eye of then-manager Mourinho, who promoted McKenna to first-team coaching duties following the departure of longtime assistant Rui Faria in 2018. When Mourinho was fired in December 2018, incoming manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer retained McKenna within his first-team coaching group.

During Solskjaer's turbulent three-year period in charge, United offered to recruit a more experienced coach to bolster the coaching setup -- both McKenna and fellow coach Michael Carrick were viewed as being novices -- but Solskjaer rejected the proposal, insisting that he had a ""world-class"" coaching team with McKenna and Carrick. Following Solskjaer's exit in November 2021, McKenna worked under interim manager Ralf Rangnick for a month before being hired by Ipswich. His two promotions at Portman Road have earmarked McKenna as a rising star in management, but having secured Premier League football by winning promotion, McKenna is expected to remain at Ipswich next season rather than seeking a move elsewhere.

""I love it here,"" McKenna said as Ipswich celebrated promotion. ""There's some big and exciting steps to come."" -- Ogden

Style of play: Attack-minded, fluid, passing football. Girona are the second-highest scorers in LaLiga this season -- one goal behind Real Madrid -- but that positive approach means they concede goals, too. The team's shape frequently shifts. Michel often favours a back four but can switch to three at the back, depending on the opposition.

Biggest achievement to date: Taking Girona into LaLiga's top four -- at the time of writing they're second, a point ahead of Barcelona -- and, while it lasted, mounting a credible title challenge up against two giants with bigger, better squads and much higher wage bills.

Clubs linked with: Girona's success -- and playing style -- has seen Michel talked about as a future Barca coach. He's also been linked with potential summer vacancies at Manchester United and Chelsea, and Girona's membership of the City Group makes him an obvious candidate to eventually succeed Guardiola.

As a player, Michel was a hero at Rayo Vallecano, a talented midfielder regarded as one of the best players in the modest club's history. As a coach, he made his name at Rayo too, getting them promoted to LaLiga in 2018 before being sacked the next season. He repeated the trick at Huesca the following year, winning them promotion, but failing to see out the campaign in Primera.

At Girona, his profile as a coach has skyrocketed. Having acquired a reputation as a promotion specialist, he was brought in in 2021 and charged with getting Girona back into the first division after two failed attempts. Surviving an early rough patch, they won promotion -- Michel's third as a coach -- through the playoffs.

A solid, midtable finish in 2023 to consolidate Girona's position in the top flight was a prelude to this season's blockbuster campaign. Girona stunned Spanish football by going top of LaLiga last fall and threatening to break up the Madrid/Barca duopoly. They couldn't sustain that title push, unable to keep pace with Madrid in the second half of the season, but it's still been a campaign packed with highlights. Two league wins over Barcelona -- beating them 4-2 home and away -- stand out.

Michel's next challenge will be repeating Girona's success in 2024-25, now that they're no longer a surprise, and -- provided UEFA approve their involvement, given the City connection -- overseeing their debut campaign in the Champions League. -- Kirkland

Style of play: The former Barcelona, Inter and PSG man has become synonymous with a high possession style of play, preaching positive, fluid football that overawes opponents. As with many coaches these days, there is also a strong emphasis on winning back the ball high up the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Not only did Bologna secure a European place for the first time in 22 years, but the Rossoblù will be making that bow in the Champions League no less.

Clubs linked with: Juventus are the club to which he's most often linked, and many reports have gone as far as to suggest a deal has already been struck to land Motta. Chelsea and Manchester United are the others mentioned.

Motta's success has not been without a few bumps in the road. His first job at Genoa ended with him being fired after the club slumped to last place in Serie A. At Spezia, however, he showed more of his burgeoning talent as a coach. Despite nearly sacking him, the club persisted with Motta, who repaid them by helping Spezia escape relegation.

Bologna has been nothing but a major success for Motta, however, where he's showcased an extremely fluid, energetic brand of football. Italian legend Fabio Capello believes there is a heavy Spanish tactical influence on Motta's approach, following his time as a player there with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. However, having worked under Mourinho and cult coaching figure Gian Piero Gasperini, it's clear Motta has looked to take something from every coach he's worked with. The versatility and flexibility in his approach must be admired.

If Juventus are to break away from the Massimiliano Allegri era, there wouldn't be a coach more further removed from the Italian's gruelling on the eye style. A young squad with high technical ability as well as strong physical characteristics is clearly when Motta does his best work. -- Cartlidge

Style of play: Slot is a 4-3-3 coach, which is a key factor in his emergence as Liverpool's choice to succeed Klopp as manager at Anfield. Feyenoord play an aggressive, high-energy attacking brand of football and, again like Liverpool, play to win possession quickly when losing the ball in the attacking third of the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Domestically, Slot's biggest success was guiding Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title -- the club's second Dutch championship this century -- in 2022-23. Guiding the Rotterdam-based team to the Europa Conference League final in 2022, before losing to Mourinho's Roma in Tirana, embellished his reputation on the European stage.

Clubs linked with: Slot was mentioned in relation to a string of clubs (from Leeds United to Tottenham, Chelsea and Bayern Munich) but he is expected to be announced as Liverpool's new manager in the coming days.

Slot had an unremarkable career as a midfielder, making more than 450 appearances in the Netherlands with four different clubs, but he never made it to one of the Eredivisie's big three (Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV Eindhoven). Regarded as a player with passing vision and creativity rather than a physical, box-to-box midfielder, Slot started his coaching career as a youth coach with PEC Zwolle after ending his playing days in 2013. But his coaching career has been a slow burn, with Slot moving to second division side Cambuur after a year at Zwolle, becoming an assistant to a succession of coaches before being appointed joint-coach with Sipke Hulshoff in October 2016.

Despite guiding Cambuur to the Dutch Cup semifinals for the first time in 2017, Slot relinquished his joint-manager role to take another assistant coach position at AZ Alkmaar and it wasn't until the start of the 2019-20 season that he would be appointed as head coach, when he stepped up at AZ following the departure of John van den Brom. With his first season halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Slot was then fired by AZ in December 2020 after negotiating a deal to join Feyenoord. Although his time in Alkmaar was relatively brief, his average haul of 2.11 points per game was the highest in AZ's Eredivisie history.

Slot's 3½ years at Feyenoord have coincided with a revival of the club's fortunes, with success in the league and cup as well as the run to the Europa Conference League final, but he will move to Liverpool having managed just six games in the Champions League, losing four and winning two.

Unlike fellow Dutch coach Erik ten Hag, who left Ajax for Manchester United in 2022, Slot is an ebullient character, fluent in English and one who prioritises creating a bond with the supporters of the club he coaches. In that respect, he shares characteristics with the man he will replace at Liverpool, Klopp, but he will head to Anfield with a clear lack of experience at the highest level of the game. -- Ogden",africa.espn.com,news,ESPN.com,,0.2549019607843137,453396982,10,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0508%2Fsoccer_elite_managers_16x9.jpg,

However, if you take a look at the dugouts around the Champions League, Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and Primeira Liga, you'll see a whole crop of coaches who could one day be the next world-famous figureheads of elite teams.

Some have already won league titles and major trophies with their current clubs, while others have shown they can compete with, and even beat, the traditional powerhouses despite working with less-heralded players and fewer resources. They might have taken all the knowledge and wisdom gleaned from the world's best coaches during glittering playing careers and applied it successfully to their own managerial styles, or they could have soaked up all they know from the sideline having failed to make the grade on the pitch.

But all of them have put themselves in the conversation for a job at one or more of the biggest clubs in Europe whenever they make their next moves. Who will replace Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich this summer? Or fill the shoes of Carlo Ancelotti when he inevitably steps down as Real Madrid boss?

Here is a look at Slot and 10 other managers who could soon be joining him at football's top table, with details on their signature styles of play, their biggest achievements to date and which clubs they have already been linked with.

Style of play: Attacking football with a lot of movement, a high defensive line and a lot of possession in a 3-4-2-1 formation most of the time.

Biggest achievement to date: Have you watched Leverkusen this season? Alonso & Co. won the Bundesliga title this year with a few games to spare in his first full season as a manager. His team is also in the German Cup final and the Europa League final later this month while still unbeaten in 50 games so far this season.

Clubs linked with: Liverpool and Bayern Munich wanted him badly, while Real Madrid eye him as the successor of Carlo Ancelotti when he will decide to leave. But Alonso chose to stay at Leverkusen for at least another season.

Since Pep Guardiola, we have never seen a manager be so successful in his first full season at a top club. While Guardiola had Lionel Messi and a stellar squad to call upon at Barcelona, Xabi Alonso pretty much had to do it all himself. He took over at the Bayer Arena from Gerardo Seoane when the team was 17th in the table in October 2022 and in crisis. Prior to joining, he'd only managed the Real Sociedad reserve team by then (with mixed results and an average points per game of 1.5 and a 40% win ratio), though his reputation and stock were both sky-high.

When you were one of the best players of your generation with one of the highest football IQs, and you'd been coached by Rafael Benitez, José Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti during your career, you may have seemed destined to becoming a top manager like Mourinho himself tipped Alonso to be. And it's fair to say he's already making history with this incredible 2023-24 season.

His team plays an exciting style of football that he has perfectly implemented with his squad. His recruitment (Victor Boniface, Ale Grimaldo, Granit Xhaka, Nathan Tella, to name just four) has been great, and he's drilled into his squad the same spirit that Alonso himself displayed when Liverpool won the Champions League in Istanbul back in 2005. Leverkusen have been the kings of late goals and late comebacks this season thanks to the mentality instilled by their fantastic manager. -- Julien Laurens

Style of play: Amorim is committed to a 3-4-3 system, anchored at the back by former Liverpool defender Sebastián Coates, with wing-backs expected to cover the entirety of their flanks. In midfield, Amorim deploys two box-to-box midfielders behind a front three led by a traditional No. 9. This season, Sweden forward Viktor Gyökeres has helped to deliver the Portuguese title with 27 goals and 10 assists in 32 games.

Biggest achievement to date: Amorim ended Sporting's 19-year wait for a domestic title in 2020-21 and broke the Benfica-Porto duopoly in the Primeira Liga. He has backed that up by winning the title again this season.

Clubs linked with: Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, West Ham United

Amorim is the rising star of Portuguese coaching and is tipped to follow the likes of José Mourinho, André Villas-Boas, Marco Silva and Nuno Espírito Santo by securing a job in one of Europe's most high-profile leagues. The former Benfica and Portugal midfielder said this month that he was committed to one more season at Sporting after guiding the team to the Primeira Liga title. But having been high on the wanted list of Liverpool and West Ham, Amorim could yet be prised away from the Lisbon club this summer if a team is prepared to pay his €15m release clause.

Amorim is a strong character all too willing to defy authority. During his playing days at Benfica, he clashed with coach Jorge Jesus over team selection and refused to train with the nonplaying squad. During his first coaching job at third-tier Casa Pia, Amorim was given a one-year suspension by the Portuguese Football Federation for giving match instructions without having the coaching qualifications to do so; although the suspension was subsequently lifted, he resigned from his post.

His big break came with Braga, where he won the Taça de Portugal in 2021 with victory against Porto in the final before Sporting triggered a €10m release clause to hire him as coach. Amorim's eye for talent saw Sporting sign Pedro Porro, João Palhinha and João Mário before ending the club's lengthy title drought. Amorim also won the domestic cup again with Sporting, and was sent to the stands for arguing with opposition coach Carlos Carvalhal on the touchline.

Amorim's success in overcoming Benfica and Porto to establish Sporting as Portugal's top team has made him the target of many top clubs, but his refusal to compromise on his 3-4-3 system could prove to be a weakness as much as a strength going forward. -- Mark Ogden

Style of play: Fast, direct, aggressive football, pressing high and keeping a high defensive line. In Portugal's Primeira Liga, Porto dominate possession and play on the front foot, but as they showed against Arsenal in the Champions League this season, they're also willing to be ruthlessly pragmatic.

Biggest achievement to date: Porto hadn't won the league in four years when Conceição took over in 2017, with Benfica threatening to match Porto's record of five in a row. Conceição changed all that. Despite UEFA-imposed Financial Fair Play restrictions that severely limited their ability in the transfer market, Porto won the league at a canter in 2017-18, with two more titles in 2020 and 2022. He has also led them to the Champions League quarterfinals twice, going toe-to-toe with bigger clubs.

Clubs linked with: Conceição was linked to AC Milan in early May. A source told ESPN that he was ready to move from Porto this summer after seven years in charge, targeting a big club in Europe's top five leagues.

Conceição made his name as a hardworking Serie A winger in the late 90s, playing for Lazio as well as Parma and Inter Milan, and working with coaches Sven-Göran Eriksson and Hector Cuper. He starred for Portugal at Euro 2000 and briefly worked under Mourinho at Porto before retiring in 2009 and turning to coaching. After some stormy, brief managerial spells, his time at Porto has been an unequivocal success.

Conceição has won 10 trophies with Porto, a tally only Jorge Jesus can match in Portuguese football, and holds the Portuguese record for most points won in a season, 91. He is demanding, intense and passionate, and that's reflected in his teams. ""Porto are like their coach,"" Diego Simeone -- who also played alongside Conceição at Lazio -- said in 2022. ""They're enthusiastic, they're alive, they're energetic. They're intense in attack and defence. They work together and that makes them competitive.""

Conceição has dealt effectively with Porto's limited resources and often idiosyncratic senior management, helping develop young players who often move to big clubs for a significant profit: think Éder Militão (Real Madrid), Luis Díaz (Liverpool), Fabio Vieira (Arsenal) and Vitinha (PSG), among many others.

Conceição signed a new contract at Porto last month, but a source has told ESPN that he has the right to release himself from that deal if he wishes. He would like to take over a club with a more realistic chance of winning the Champions League, and which has a more clearly defined, professional structure in which the coach can focus on coaching. -- Alex Kirkland

Style of play: As he told ESPN last year, De Zerbi's philosophy is: ""I like to keep the ball, to enjoy the ball, to try every game to be protagonists on the pitch, working with passion, working with ambition and working towards a dream."" Brighton forward Danny Welbeck, meanwhile, says: ""Everybody has to be in sync.""

De Zerbi's formations switch between 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2, but whichever setup he uses, it revolves around the ability to build up from the back and transition quickly to the opposition box, swarming, pressing and playing with high intensity.

Biggest achievement to date: Guiding Sassuolo into the top eight of Serie A across both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons was a remarkable achievement, but taking Brighton to sixth in the Premier League last season and qualifying them for the Europa League tops the bill.

Clubs linked with: De Zerbi has been linked with most of the top jobs in Europe, from Bayern to Barcelona. His name has also been mentioned in connection with Liverpool, Chelsea (where uncertainty continues to surround Mauricio Pochettino), Juventus and Napoli.

Pep Guardiola has long been a De Zerbi evangelist. When he joined Brighton back in September 2022, Guardiola said the Italian was ""changing many things in English football."" The feeling is mutual; De Zerbi has taken inspiration from Guardiola, too. The players themselves talk about De Zerbi's ability to motivate them and his midmatch tactical tweaks. They see the passion he exudes on the touchline, as well as the ease with which he can shift his teams into different formations. Fundamentally, his teams try to suffocate opponents, building up from the back with Guardiola previously hailing the way De Zerbi's team progresses from goalkeeper to the final third in a blink of an eye.

De Zerbi's playing career saw him start with AC Milan and live a nomadic life on loan across Italy, primarily playing in Serie B. His coaching career began with a short-lived spell at Palermo, but it was at Sassuolo where he earned his reputation by leading them twice to a top-half finish in Serie A. There he lived and slept football, having a notepad by the side of his bed in case some tactical inspiration slipped into a dream.

He joined Shakhtar Donetsk in 2021 but left in July 2022 as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ended up taking charge of Brighton early in the 2022-23 campaign. He led the Seagulls to sixth in the Premier League, qualification for Europa League and last season's FA Cup semifinal.

This season has been a little tougher at Brighton with their squad stretched because of their run to the Europa League round of 16, and they sit in 10th. After their 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth, De Zerbi bemoaned the injuries they've suffered but also the squad's lack of motivation. ""In this moment, too many points from European qualification, we are working for an unclear target, but I can't accept a game without soul,"" he said.

De Zerbi has asked for clarity over his future and the club's ambitions, saying back in March that he was keen to hold talks -- his contract runs through 2026. But then he was vague in April regarding his future. ""I have not decided to leave, it is not the right time yet to decide anything,"" he said. The indication is that Brighton expects him to stay, but the relationship is more strained. His summer prospects are probably dependent on (a) which jobs are available and (b) his relationship with Brighton. -- Tom Hamilton

Style of play: In his first foray into coaching, Farioli developed a reputation in Turkey for risk-filled attacking play. He has shown more defensive acumen since arriving in France in 2023 in an encouraging sign that he is becoming a more balanced coach. The Italian also has shown he likes a 3-4-3 formation, asking his defensive midfielder to drop into the backline as the full-backs push forward.

Biggest achievement to date: Without a doubt becoming the youngest coach in a top-tier European league. At 31 years old, he took over at Fatih Karagümrük in March 2021 before landing a major job, again in Turkey, with Alanyaspor in December of the same year.

Clubs linked with: Farioli has seen his name touted among clubs back in Italy such as Milan and Napoli in addition to elsewhere around Europe, with Ajax and Manchester United also mentioned. Last summer, there were also links with Championship side Sunderland as they looked for a bright young coach to guide their own group of fledglings.

Farioli's first steps into the game were as an assistant to Brighton boss De Zerbi. A member of De Zerbi's technical team at Benevento reached out to Farioli after reading an article he wrote for scouting platform WyScout. De Zerbi initially brought Farioli in as his goalkeeping coach and had him by his side at both Benevento and Sassuolo. Farioli's first proper coaching job came at age 31 with Fatih Karagümrük. There, his ultra-attacking style caught the eye of Alanyaspor, who hired him in December of the same year.

Nice were similarly impressed and placed him in charge of a young first-team squad. Since being at the French club, Farioli has added some defensive nous, though it has come at the expense of some attacking vibrance. Farioli also has shown a desire for his full-backs to not only become inverted (moving centrally and overloading the midfield while in possession) but also provide overlaps, while requiring his goalkeeper and centre-backs to be confident in possession.

Nice went unbeaten this season until December, and they have managed wins away at both Monaco and PSG. They're still in hot contention for European football next season, sitting fifth (and automatic Europa League qualification) with a four-point gap to fourth-place Brest and two games left. (If they can finish fourth, that would put them in the Champions League).

As the man himself stated, ""When Plan A doesn't work, you need a better Plan A,"" confirming Farioli is very much a manager of principles and belief in his philosophy. His coaching influences are also interesting, with Farioli naming the more defensive-minded Arrigo Sacchi and Mourinho as the coaches he looks up to, though he also dropped in his admiration for Guardiola's Barcelona and Johan Cruyff's Ajax. That Farioli has shown his awareness of defending with more responsibility this season, it suggests he is preparing for life at a major club where the demands are greater when it comes to be being flexible tactically. -- David Cartlidge

Style of play: Brentford switch between a 3-5-2 and 4-3-3 formation, both with attacking intentions. They play with pace and verticality, priding themselves on set piece excellence. Under Frank's tactics, their wing-backs get plenty of miles under their belt, not afraid to hit teams on the counter, but are equally adept at focusing play through the middle, with Frank usually favouring a defensive anchor paired with two energetic box-to-box midfielders.

Biggest achievement to date: Brentford's promotion to the Premier League in 2021 was a defining moment with their return to the top flight for the first time in 74 years.

Clubs linked with: Frank has been mentioned as a possible successor to Klopp while also having been named as a possible contender for Manchester United as they weigh up Erik ten Hag's future.

Frank's coaching career started in the youth sides of the Denmark national team setup -- while doubling up as a teacher -- and he worked his way up to managing their under-19 men's team before taking charge of Brøndby in 2013. Over the course of three seasons, he led them into Europe twice before leaving in March 2016. By December of the same year, he was assistant coach at Brentford, charged with bridging the gap between the B team and the first team, before taking over from Dean Smith in October 2018. He led them to the Championship playoff final in 2020 and secured promotion a year later.

In his first season in the Premier League, they finished in 13th. Then they finished ninth last term despite having the lowest wage budget in the league, according to a Capology study. Frank also has adapted brilliantly to Brentford's data-led approach to recruitment, working with the signings brought in. But it is his unflappable nature, his incredible ability to improve players across his squad and his ruthlessly efficient style of high-energy play on the field that has seen him win so many admirers.

""Thomas is a very honest person,"" said Brentford's on-loan left-back Sergio Reguilón. ""I love the way he talks to everyone, to you, the players. I love him.""

Klopp said earlier in the season of Frank: ""He's doing a brilliant job there and seems to be very happy there. A while ago, we had a managers meeting, and he could get there by bike, so he likes life in the area. He's a cool guy. I respect him a lot.""

Frank has managed to weather anything and everything that has been thrown at him, staying calm throughout. ""His strength is his consistency of energy,"" a source told ESPN. ""I'm sure he gets stressed, but he rarely loses it and remains very level-headed.""

That's not to say it's been straightforward. Over the past nine months, he lost first-choice goalkeeper David Raya in the summer and chief goal scorer Ivan Toney to an eight-month suspension for breaching betting rules. But Brentford still have managed to secure their top-flight safety despite having a brutal injury list -- including 29 separate substantial absences for key players -- this season.

Frank is signed up with Brentford through to 2027 and isn't agitating for a move, but it's easy to imagine him somewhere bigger in the future. ""I think we all have kind of an ego, and the ego likes that little bit of sugar, but at the end of the day, I'm at Brentford. I'm very happy here,"" Frank said in February. ""Do I have ambitions? Yes. Am I going to stay at Brentford forever? Maybe, but probably not. What I know is that I'm here at Brentford and I'm very happy with it."" -- Hamilton

Style of play: Lots of verticality, plus quick forward projections and transitions with an aggressive press in a 4-4-2 formation.

Biggest achievement to date: His Stuttgart side is third in the table and he won the third-division title with the Bayern reserve team four years ago.

Clubs linked with: His name was very high on the Bayern Munich shortlist to replace Thomas Tuchel in the summer, but he decided to sign a new deal at Stuttgart.

Hoeneß is not a name easy to carry in Germany. Sebastian will never be the most famous Hoeneß in German football -- that honor goes to his uncle, Uli, for his exploits as a player and Bayern Munich president -- but he is making a (first) name for himself. Outside of Alonso, Hoeneß has been the best coach in the Bundesliga this season, and it's not been close.

After arriving at Stuttgart in April 2023 and finishing 16th, he changed the team and its fortunes completely to make it one of the best in the country. After doing well with the Bayern Munich youth and reserve teams, and a decent first season in charge at Hoffenheim (picking up 1.4 points per game from 2020 to 2022), Stuttgart was a big job, and he rose to the occasion. His team has been super efficient in all areas of the pitch -- in particular their attack, where Serhou Guirassy and Denis Undav have been superb. He made every player improve individually while collectively, his team was resilient and well drilled.

Taking this side into next season's Champions League feels like a trophy for him, though bigger and better things surely await him. Maybe he'll team up with his uncle at Bayern one day, but for now he'll continue building his own path. -- Laurens

Style of play: When McKenna took charge of Ipswich in December 2021, with the team 12th in League One, he made clear his determination to revive the team by instilling a possession-based game at the club. He has retained that philosophy and secured back-to-back promotions.

Biggest achievement to date: McKenna ended Ipswich's 22-year absence from the Premier League by winning promotion from the Championship this season -- an achievement made even more impressive because the team received promotion from League One only 12 months earlier.

Clubs linked with: Brighton, Celtic, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Manchester United.

Having progressed through the youth ranks at Tottenham Hotspur, McKenna was forced to retire at the age of 22 without making a senior appearance as a result of a hip injury. Determined to make a career in football, the Northern Irishman earned a sports science degree at Loughborough University before working as a youth team coach at Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Leicester and the Vancouver Whitecaps.

McKenna returned to Spurs, moving through the coaching ranks to become head of the club's under-18 teams until he was hired by Manchester United to assume the same role at Old Trafford. His work with the United youngsters caught the eye of then-manager Mourinho, who promoted McKenna to first-team coaching duties following the departure of longtime assistant Rui Faria in 2018. When Mourinho was fired in December 2018, incoming manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer retained McKenna within his first-team coaching group.

During Solskjaer's turbulent three-year period in charge, United offered to recruit a more experienced coach to bolster the coaching setup -- both McKenna and fellow coach Michael Carrick were viewed as being novices -- but Solskjaer rejected the proposal, insisting that he had a ""world-class"" coaching team with McKenna and Carrick. Following Solskjaer's exit in November 2021, McKenna worked under interim manager Ralf Rangnick for a month before being hired by Ipswich. His two promotions at Portman Road have earmarked McKenna as a rising star in management, but having secured Premier League football by winning promotion, McKenna is expected to remain at Ipswich next season rather than seeking a move elsewhere.

""I love it here,"" McKenna said as Ipswich celebrated promotion. ""There's some big and exciting steps to come."" -- Ogden

Style of play: Attack-minded, fluid, passing football. Girona are the second-highest scorers in LaLiga this season -- one goal behind Real Madrid -- but that positive approach means they concede goals, too. The team's shape frequently shifts. Michel often favours a back four but can switch to three at the back, depending on the opposition.

Biggest achievement to date: Taking Girona into LaLiga's top four -- at the time of writing they're second, a point ahead of Barcelona -- and, while it lasted, mounting a credible title challenge up against two giants with bigger, better squads and much higher wage bills.

Clubs linked with: Girona's success -- and playing style -- has seen Michel talked about as a future Barca coach. He's also been linked with potential summer vacancies at Manchester United and Chelsea, and Girona's membership of the City Group makes him an obvious candidate to eventually succeed Guardiola.

As a player, Michel was a hero at Rayo Vallecano, a talented midfielder regarded as one of the best players in the modest club's history. As a coach, he made his name at Rayo too, getting them promoted to LaLiga in 2018 before being sacked the next season. He repeated the trick at Huesca the following year, winning them promotion, but failing to see out the campaign in Primera.

At Girona, his profile as a coach has skyrocketed. Having acquired a reputation as a promotion specialist, he was brought in in 2021 and charged with getting Girona back into the first division after two failed attempts. Surviving an early rough patch, they won promotion -- Michel's third as a coach -- through the playoffs.

A solid, midtable finish in 2023 to consolidate Girona's position in the top flight was a prelude to this season's blockbuster campaign. Girona stunned Spanish football by going top of LaLiga last fall and threatening to break up the Madrid/Barca duopoly. They couldn't sustain that title push, unable to keep pace with Madrid in the second half of the season, but it's still been a campaign packed with highlights. Two league wins over Barcelona -- beating them 4-2 home and away -- stand out.

Michel's next challenge will be repeating Girona's success in 2024-25, now that they're no longer a surprise, and -- provided UEFA approve their involvement, given the City connection -- overseeing their debut campaign in the Champions League. -- Kirkland

Style of play: The former Barcelona, Inter and PSG man has become synonymous with a high possession style of play, preaching positive, fluid football that overawes opponents. As with many coaches these days, there is also a strong emphasis on winning back the ball high up the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Not only did Bologna secure a European place for the first time in 22 years, but the Rossoblù will be making that bow in the Champions League no less.

Clubs linked with: Juventus are the club to which he's most often linked, and many reports have gone as far as to suggest a deal has already been struck to land Motta. Chelsea and Manchester United are the others mentioned.

Motta's success has not been without a few bumps in the road. His first job at Genoa ended with him being fired after the club slumped to last place in Serie A. At Spezia, however, he showed more of his burgeoning talent as a coach. Despite nearly sacking him, the club persisted with Motta, who repaid them by helping Spezia escape relegation.

Bologna has been nothing but a major success for Motta, however, where he's showcased an extremely fluid, energetic brand of football. Italian legend Fabio Capello believes there is a heavy Spanish tactical influence on Motta's approach, following his time as a player there with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. However, having worked under Mourinho and cult coaching figure Gian Piero Gasperini, it's clear Motta has looked to take something from every coach he's worked with. The versatility and flexibility in his approach must be admired.

If Juventus are to break away from the Massimiliano Allegri era, there wouldn't be a coach more further removed from the Italian's gruelling on the eye style. A young squad with high technical ability as well as strong physical characteristics is clearly when Motta does his best work. -- Cartlidge

Style of play: Slot is a 4-3-3 coach, which is a key factor in his emergence as Liverpool's choice to succeed Klopp as manager at Anfield. Feyenoord play an aggressive, high-energy attacking brand of football and, again like Liverpool, play to win possession quickly when losing the ball in the attacking third of the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Domestically, Slot's biggest success was guiding Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title -- the club's second Dutch championship this century -- in 2022-23. Guiding the Rotterdam-based team to the Europa Conference League final in 2022, before losing to Mourinho's Roma in Tirana, embellished his reputation on the European stage.

Clubs linked with: Slot was mentioned in relation to a string of clubs (from Leeds United to Tottenham, Chelsea and Bayern Munich) but he is expected to be announced as Liverpool's new manager in the coming days.

Slot had an unremarkable career as a midfielder, making more than 450 appearances in the Netherlands with four different clubs, but he never made it to one of the Eredivisie's big three (Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV Eindhoven). Regarded as a player with passing vision and creativity rather than a physical, box-to-box midfielder, Slot started his coaching career as a youth coach with PEC Zwolle after ending his playing days in 2013. But his coaching career has been a slow burn, with Slot moving to second division side Cambuur after a year at Zwolle, becoming an assistant to a succession of coaches before being appointed joint-coach with Sipke Hulshoff in October 2016.

Despite guiding Cambuur to the Dutch Cup semifinals for the first time in 2017, Slot relinquished his joint-manager role to take another assistant coach position at AZ Alkmaar and it wasn't until the start of the 2019-20 season that he would be appointed as head coach, when he stepped up at AZ following the departure of John van den Brom. With his first season halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Slot was then fired by AZ in December 2020 after negotiating a deal to join Feyenoord. Although his time in Alkmaar was relatively brief, his average haul of 2.11 points per game was the highest in AZ's Eredivisie history.

Slot's 3½ years at Feyenoord have coincided with a revival of the club's fortunes, with success in the league and cup as well as the run to the Europa Conference League final, but he will move to Liverpool having managed just six games in the Champions League, losing four and winning two.

Unlike fellow Dutch coach Erik ten Hag, who left Ajax for Manchester United in 2022, Slot is an ebullient character, fluent in English and one who prioritises creating a bond with the supporters of the club he coaches. In that respect, he shares characteristics with the man he will replace at Liverpool, Klopp, but he will head to Anfield with a clear lack of experience at the highest level of the game. -- Ogden",espn.in,news,ESPN,,0.2549019607843137,453395251,10,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0508%2Fsoccer_elite_managers_16x9.jpg,

However, if you take a look at the dugouts around the Champions League, Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and Primeira Liga, you'll see a whole crop of coaches who could one day be the next world-famous figureheads of elite teams.

Some have already won league titles and major trophies with their current clubs, while others have shown they can compete with, and even beat, the traditional powerhouses despite working with less-heralded players and fewer resources. They might have taken all the knowledge and wisdom gleaned from the world's best coaches during glittering playing careers and applied it successfully to their own managerial styles, or they could have soaked up all they know from the sideline having failed to make the grade on the pitch.

But all of them have put themselves in the conversation for a job at one or more of the biggest clubs in Europe whenever they make their next moves. Who will replace Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich this summer? Or fill the shoes of Carlo Ancelotti when he inevitably steps down as Real Madrid boss?

Here is a look at Slot and 10 other managers who could soon be joining him at football's top table, with details on their signature styles of play, their biggest achievements to date and which clubs they have already been linked with.

Style of play: Attacking football with a lot of movement, a high defensive line and a lot of possession in a 3-4-2-1 formation most of the time.

Biggest achievement to date: Have you watched Leverkusen this season? Alonso & Co. won the Bundesliga title this year with a few games to spare in his first full season as a manager. His team is also in the German Cup final and the Europa League final later this month while still unbeaten in 50 games so far this season.

Clubs linked with: Liverpool and Bayern Munich wanted him badly, while Real Madrid eye him as the successor of Carlo Ancelotti when he will decide to leave. But Alonso chose to stay at Leverkusen for at least another season.

Since Pep Guardiola, we have never seen a manager be so successful in his first full season at a top club. While Guardiola had Lionel Messi and a stellar squad to call upon at Barcelona, Xabi Alonso pretty much had to do it all himself. He took over at the Bayer Arena from Gerardo Seoane when the team was 17th in the table in October 2022 and in crisis. Prior to joining, he'd only managed the Real Sociedad reserve team by then (with mixed results and an average points per game of 1.5 and a 40% win ratio), though his reputation and stock were both sky-high.

When you were one of the best players of your generation with one of the highest football IQs, and you'd been coached by Rafael Benitez, José Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti during your career, you may have seemed destined to becoming a top manager like Mourinho himself tipped Alonso to be. And it's fair to say he's already making history with this incredible 2023-24 season.

His team plays an exciting style of football that he has perfectly implemented with his squad. His recruitment (Victor Boniface, Ale Grimaldo, Granit Xhaka, Nathan Tella, to name just four) has been great, and he's drilled into his squad the same spirit that Alonso himself displayed when Liverpool won the Champions League in Istanbul back in 2005. Leverkusen have been the kings of late goals and late comebacks this season thanks to the mentality instilled by their fantastic manager. -- Julien Laurens

Style of play: Amorim is committed to a 3-4-3 system, anchored at the back by former Liverpool defender Sebastián Coates, with wing-backs expected to cover the entirety of their flanks. In midfield, Amorim deploys two box-to-box midfielders behind a front three led by a traditional No. 9. This season, Sweden forward Viktor Gyökeres has helped to deliver the Portuguese title with 27 goals and 10 assists in 32 games.

Biggest achievement to date: Amorim ended Sporting's 19-year wait for a domestic title in 2020-21 and broke the Benfica-Porto duopoly in the Primeira Liga. He has backed that up by winning the title again this season.

Clubs linked with: Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, West Ham United

Amorim is the rising star of Portuguese coaching and is tipped to follow the likes of José Mourinho, André Villas-Boas, Marco Silva and Nuno Espírito Santo by securing a job in one of Europe's most high-profile leagues. The former Benfica and Portugal midfielder said this month that he was committed to one more season at Sporting after guiding the team to the Primeira Liga title. But having been high on the wanted list of Liverpool and West Ham, Amorim could yet be prised away from the Lisbon club this summer if a team is prepared to pay his €15m release clause.

Amorim is a strong character all too willing to defy authority. During his playing days at Benfica, he clashed with coach Jorge Jesus over team selection and refused to train with the nonplaying squad. During his first coaching job at third-tier Casa Pia, Amorim was given a one-year suspension by the Portuguese Football Federation for giving match instructions without having the coaching qualifications to do so; although the suspension was subsequently lifted, he resigned from his post.

His big break came with Braga, where he won the Taça de Portugal in 2021 with victory against Porto in the final before Sporting triggered a €10m release clause to hire him as coach. Amorim's eye for talent saw Sporting sign Pedro Porro, João Palhinha and João Mário before ending the club's lengthy title drought. Amorim also won the domestic cup again with Sporting, and was sent to the stands for arguing with opposition coach Carlos Carvalhal on the touchline.

Amorim's success in overcoming Benfica and Porto to establish Sporting as Portugal's top team has made him the target of many top clubs, but his refusal to compromise on his 3-4-3 system could prove to be a weakness as much as a strength going forward. -- Mark Ogden

Style of play: Fast, direct, aggressive football, pressing high and keeping a high defensive line. In Portugal's Primeira Liga, Porto dominate possession and play on the front foot, but as they showed against Arsenal in the Champions League this season, they're also willing to be ruthlessly pragmatic.

Biggest achievement to date: Porto hadn't won the league in four years when Conceição took over in 2017, with Benfica threatening to match Porto's record of five in a row. Conceição changed all that. Despite UEFA-imposed Financial Fair Play restrictions that severely limited their ability in the transfer market, Porto won the league at a canter in 2017-18, with two more titles in 2020 and 2022. He has also led them to the Champions League quarterfinals twice, going toe-to-toe with bigger clubs.

Clubs linked with: Conceição was linked to AC Milan in early May. A source told ESPN that he was ready to move from Porto this summer after seven years in charge, targeting a big club in Europe's top five leagues.

Conceição made his name as a hardworking Serie A winger in the late 90s, playing for Lazio as well as Parma and Inter Milan, and working with coaches Sven-Göran Eriksson and Hector Cuper. He starred for Portugal at Euro 2000 and briefly worked under Mourinho at Porto before retiring in 2009 and turning to coaching. After some stormy, brief managerial spells, his time at Porto has been an unequivocal success.

Conceição has won 10 trophies with Porto, a tally only Jorge Jesus can match in Portuguese football, and holds the Portuguese record for most points won in a season, 91. He is demanding, intense and passionate, and that's reflected in his teams. ""Porto are like their coach,"" Diego Simeone -- who also played alongside Conceição at Lazio -- said in 2022. ""They're enthusiastic, they're alive, they're energetic. They're intense in attack and defence. They work together and that makes them competitive.""

Conceição has dealt effectively with Porto's limited resources and often idiosyncratic senior management, helping develop young players who often move to big clubs for a significant profit: think Éder Militão (Real Madrid), Luis Díaz (Liverpool), Fabio Vieira (Arsenal) and Vitinha (PSG), among many others.

Conceição signed a new contract at Porto last month, but a source has told ESPN that he has the right to release himself from that deal if he wishes. He would like to take over a club with a more realistic chance of winning the Champions League, and which has a more clearly defined, professional structure in which the coach can focus on coaching. -- Alex Kirkland

Style of play: As he told ESPN last year, De Zerbi's philosophy is: ""I like to keep the ball, to enjoy the ball, to try every game to be protagonists on the pitch, working with passion, working with ambition and working towards a dream."" Brighton forward Danny Welbeck, meanwhile, says: ""Everybody has to be in sync.""

De Zerbi's formations switch between 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2, but whichever setup he uses, it revolves around the ability to build up from the back and transition quickly to the opposition box, swarming, pressing and playing with high intensity.

Biggest achievement to date: Guiding Sassuolo into the top eight of Serie A across both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons was a remarkable achievement, but taking Brighton to sixth in the Premier League last season and qualifying them for the Europa League tops the bill.

Clubs linked with: De Zerbi has been linked with most of the top jobs in Europe, from Bayern to Barcelona. His name has also been mentioned in connection with Liverpool, Chelsea (where uncertainty continues to surround Mauricio Pochettino), Juventus and Napoli.

Pep Guardiola has long been a De Zerbi evangelist. When he joined Brighton back in September 2022, Guardiola said the Italian was ""changing many things in English football."" The feeling is mutual; De Zerbi has taken inspiration from Guardiola, too. The players themselves talk about De Zerbi's ability to motivate them and his midmatch tactical tweaks. They see the passion he exudes on the touchline, as well as the ease with which he can shift his teams into different formations. Fundamentally, his teams try to suffocate opponents, building up from the back with Guardiola previously hailing the way De Zerbi's team progresses from goalkeeper to the final third in a blink of an eye.

De Zerbi's playing career saw him start with AC Milan and live a nomadic life on loan across Italy, primarily playing in Serie B. His coaching career began with a short-lived spell at Palermo, but it was at Sassuolo where he earned his reputation by leading them twice to a top-half finish in Serie A. There he lived and slept football, having a notepad by the side of his bed in case some tactical inspiration slipped into a dream.

He joined Shakhtar Donetsk in 2021 but left in July 2022 as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ended up taking charge of Brighton early in the 2022-23 campaign. He led the Seagulls to sixth in the Premier League, qualification for Europa League and last season's FA Cup semifinal.

This season has been a little tougher at Brighton with their squad stretched because of their run to the Europa League round of 16, and they sit in 10th. After their 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth, De Zerbi bemoaned the injuries they've suffered but also the squad's lack of motivation. ""In this moment, too many points from European qualification, we are working for an unclear target, but I can't accept a game without soul,"" he said.

De Zerbi has asked for clarity over his future and the club's ambitions, saying back in March that he was keen to hold talks -- his contract runs through 2026. But then he was vague in April regarding his future. ""I have not decided to leave, it is not the right time yet to decide anything,"" he said. The indication is that Brighton expects him to stay, but the relationship is more strained. His summer prospects are probably dependent on (a) which jobs are available and (b) his relationship with Brighton. -- Tom Hamilton

Style of play: In his first foray into coaching, Farioli developed a reputation in Turkey for risk-filled attacking play. He has shown more defensive acumen since arriving in France in 2023 in an encouraging sign that he is becoming a more balanced coach. The Italian also has shown he likes a 3-4-3 formation, asking his defensive midfielder to drop into the backline as the full-backs push forward.

Biggest achievement to date: Without a doubt becoming the youngest coach in a top-tier European league. At 31 years old, he took over at Fatih Karagümrük in March 2021 before landing a major job, again in Turkey, with Alanyaspor in December of the same year.

Clubs linked with: Farioli has seen his name touted among clubs back in Italy such as Milan and Napoli in addition to elsewhere around Europe, with Ajax and Manchester United also mentioned. Last summer, there were also links with Championship side Sunderland as they looked for a bright young coach to guide their own group of fledglings.

Farioli's first steps into the game were as an assistant to Brighton boss De Zerbi. A member of De Zerbi's technical team at Benevento reached out to Farioli after reading an article he wrote for scouting platform WyScout. De Zerbi initially brought Farioli in as his goalkeeping coach and had him by his side at both Benevento and Sassuolo. Farioli's first proper coaching job came at age 31 with Fatih Karagümrük. There, his ultra-attacking style caught the eye of Alanyaspor, who hired him in December of the same year.

Nice were similarly impressed and placed him in charge of a young first-team squad. Since being at the French club, Farioli has added some defensive nous, though it has come at the expense of some attacking vibrance. Farioli also has shown a desire for his full-backs to not only become inverted (moving centrally and overloading the midfield while in possession) but also provide overlaps, while requiring his goalkeeper and centre-backs to be confident in possession.

Nice went unbeaten this season until December, and they have managed wins away at both Monaco and PSG. They're still in hot contention for European football next season, sitting fifth (and automatic Europa League qualification) with a four-point gap to fourth-place Brest and two games left. (If they can finish fourth, that would put them in the Champions League).

As the man himself stated, ""When Plan A doesn't work, you need a better Plan A,"" confirming Farioli is very much a manager of principles and belief in his philosophy. His coaching influences are also interesting, with Farioli naming the more defensive-minded Arrigo Sacchi and Mourinho as the coaches he looks up to, though he also dropped in his admiration for Guardiola's Barcelona and Johan Cruyff's Ajax. That Farioli has shown his awareness of defending with more responsibility this season, it suggests he is preparing for life at a major club where the demands are greater when it comes to be being flexible tactically. -- David Cartlidge

Style of play: Brentford switch between a 3-5-2 and 4-3-3 formation, both with attacking intentions. They play with pace and verticality, priding themselves on set piece excellence. Under Frank's tactics, their wing-backs get plenty of miles under their belt, not afraid to hit teams on the counter, but are equally adept at focusing play through the middle, with Frank usually favouring a defensive anchor paired with two energetic box-to-box midfielders.

Biggest achievement to date: Brentford's promotion to the Premier League in 2021 was a defining moment with their return to the top flight for the first time in 74 years.

Clubs linked with: Frank has been mentioned as a possible successor to Klopp while also having been named as a possible contender for Manchester United as they weigh up Erik ten Hag's future.

Frank's coaching career started in the youth sides of the Denmark national team setup -- while doubling up as a teacher -- and he worked his way up to managing their under-19 men's team before taking charge of Brøndby in 2013. Over the course of three seasons, he led them into Europe twice before leaving in March 2016. By December of the same year, he was assistant coach at Brentford, charged with bridging the gap between the B team and the first team, before taking over from Dean Smith in October 2018. He led them to the Championship playoff final in 2020 and secured promotion a year later.

In his first season in the Premier League, they finished in 13th. Then they finished ninth last term despite having the lowest wage budget in the league, according to a Capology study. Frank also has adapted brilliantly to Brentford's data-led approach to recruitment, working with the signings brought in. But it is his unflappable nature, his incredible ability to improve players across his squad and his ruthlessly efficient style of high-energy play on the field that has seen him win so many admirers.

""Thomas is a very honest person,"" said Brentford's on-loan left-back Sergio Reguilón. ""I love the way he talks to everyone, to you, the players. I love him.""

Klopp said earlier in the season of Frank: ""He's doing a brilliant job there and seems to be very happy there. A while ago, we had a managers meeting, and he could get there by bike, so he likes life in the area. He's a cool guy. I respect him a lot.""

Frank has managed to weather anything and everything that has been thrown at him, staying calm throughout. ""His strength is his consistency of energy,"" a source told ESPN. ""I'm sure he gets stressed, but he rarely loses it and remains very level-headed.""

That's not to say it's been straightforward. Over the past nine months, he lost first-choice goalkeeper David Raya in the summer and chief goal scorer Ivan Toney to an eight-month suspension for breaching betting rules. But Brentford still have managed to secure their top-flight safety despite having a brutal injury list -- including 29 separate substantial absences for key players -- this season.

Frank is signed up with Brentford through to 2027 and isn't agitating for a move, but it's easy to imagine him somewhere bigger in the future. ""I think we all have kind of an ego, and the ego likes that little bit of sugar, but at the end of the day, I'm at Brentford. I'm very happy here,"" Frank said in February. ""Do I have ambitions? Yes. Am I going to stay at Brentford forever? Maybe, but probably not. What I know is that I'm here at Brentford and I'm very happy with it."" -- Hamilton

Style of play: Lots of verticality, plus quick forward projections and transitions with an aggressive press in a 4-4-2 formation.

Biggest achievement to date: His Stuttgart side is third in the table and he won the third-division title with the Bayern reserve team four years ago.

Clubs linked with: His name was very high on the Bayern Munich shortlist to replace Thomas Tuchel in the summer, but he decided to sign a new deal at Stuttgart.

Hoeneß is not a name easy to carry in Germany. Sebastian will never be the most famous Hoeneß in German football -- that honor goes to his uncle, Uli, for his exploits as a player and Bayern Munich president -- but he is making a (first) name for himself. Outside of Alonso, Hoeneß has been the best coach in the Bundesliga this season, and it's not been close.

After arriving at Stuttgart in April 2023 and finishing 16th, he changed the team and its fortunes completely to make it one of the best in the country. After doing well with the Bayern Munich youth and reserve teams, and a decent first season in charge at Hoffenheim (picking up 1.4 points per game from 2020 to 2022), Stuttgart was a big job, and he rose to the occasion. His team has been super efficient in all areas of the pitch -- in particular their attack, where Serhou Guirassy and Denis Undav have been superb. He made every player improve individually while collectively, his team was resilient and well drilled.

Taking this side into next season's Champions League feels like a trophy for him, though bigger and better things surely await him. Maybe he'll team up with his uncle at Bayern one day, but for now he'll continue building his own path. -- Laurens

Style of play: When McKenna took charge of Ipswich in December 2021, with the team 12th in League One, he made clear his determination to revive the team by instilling a possession-based game at the club. He has retained that philosophy and secured back-to-back promotions.

Biggest achievement to date: McKenna ended Ipswich's 22-year absence from the Premier League by winning promotion from the Championship this season -- an achievement made even more impressive because the team received promotion from League One only 12 months earlier.

Clubs linked with: Brighton, Celtic, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Manchester United.

Having progressed through the youth ranks at Tottenham Hotspur, McKenna was forced to retire at the age of 22 without making a senior appearance as a result of a hip injury. Determined to make a career in football, the Northern Irishman earned a sports science degree at Loughborough University before working as a youth team coach at Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Leicester and the Vancouver Whitecaps.

McKenna returned to Spurs, moving through the coaching ranks to become head of the club's under-18 teams until he was hired by Manchester United to assume the same role at Old Trafford. His work with the United youngsters caught the eye of then-manager Mourinho, who promoted McKenna to first-team coaching duties following the departure of longtime assistant Rui Faria in 2018. When Mourinho was fired in December 2018, incoming manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer retained McKenna within his first-team coaching group.

During Solskjaer's turbulent three-year period in charge, United offered to recruit a more experienced coach to bolster the coaching setup -- both McKenna and fellow coach Michael Carrick were viewed as being novices -- but Solskjaer rejected the proposal, insisting that he had a ""world-class"" coaching team with McKenna and Carrick. Following Solskjaer's exit in November 2021, McKenna worked under interim manager Ralf Rangnick for a month before being hired by Ipswich. His two promotions at Portman Road have earmarked McKenna as a rising star in management, but having secured Premier League football by winning promotion, McKenna is expected to remain at Ipswich next season rather than seeking a move elsewhere.

""I love it here,"" McKenna said as Ipswich celebrated promotion. ""There's some big and exciting steps to come."" -- Ogden

Style of play: Attack-minded, fluid, passing football. Girona are the second-highest scorers in LaLiga this season -- one goal behind Real Madrid -- but that positive approach means they concede goals, too. The team's shape frequently shifts. Michel often favours a back four but can switch to three at the back, depending on the opposition.

Biggest achievement to date: Taking Girona into LaLiga's top four -- at the time of writing they're second, a point ahead of Barcelona -- and, while it lasted, mounting a credible title challenge up against two giants with bigger, better squads and much higher wage bills.

Clubs linked with: Girona's success -- and playing style -- has seen Michel talked about as a future Barca coach. He's also been linked with potential summer vacancies at Manchester United and Chelsea, and Girona's membership of the City Group makes him an obvious candidate to eventually succeed Guardiola.

As a player, Michel was a hero at Rayo Vallecano, a talented midfielder regarded as one of the best players in the modest club's history. As a coach, he made his name at Rayo too, getting them promoted to LaLiga in 2018 before being sacked the next season. He repeated the trick at Huesca the following year, winning them promotion, but failing to see out the campaign in Primera.

At Girona, his profile as a coach has skyrocketed. Having acquired a reputation as a promotion specialist, he was brought in in 2021 and charged with getting Girona back into the first division after two failed attempts. Surviving an early rough patch, they won promotion -- Michel's third as a coach -- through the playoffs.

A solid, midtable finish in 2023 to consolidate Girona's position in the top flight was a prelude to this season's blockbuster campaign. Girona stunned Spanish football by going top of LaLiga last fall and threatening to break up the Madrid/Barca duopoly. They couldn't sustain that title push, unable to keep pace with Madrid in the second half of the season, but it's still been a campaign packed with highlights. Two league wins over Barcelona -- beating them 4-2 home and away -- stand out.

Michel's next challenge will be repeating Girona's success in 2024-25, now that they're no longer a surprise, and -- provided UEFA approve their involvement, given the City connection -- overseeing their debut campaign in the Champions League. -- Kirkland

Style of play: The former Barcelona, Inter and PSG man has become synonymous with a high possession style of play, preaching positive, fluid football that overawes opponents. As with many coaches these days, there is also a strong emphasis on winning back the ball high up the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Not only did Bologna secure a European place for the first time in 22 years, but the Rossoblù will be making that bow in the Champions League no less.

Clubs linked with: Juventus are the club to which he's most often linked, and many reports have gone as far as to suggest a deal has already been struck to land Motta. Chelsea and Manchester United are the others mentioned.

Motta's success has not been without a few bumps in the road. His first job at Genoa ended with him being fired after the club slumped to last place in Serie A. At Spezia, however, he showed more of his burgeoning talent as a coach. Despite nearly sacking him, the club persisted with Motta, who repaid them by helping Spezia escape relegation.

Bologna has been nothing but a major success for Motta, however, where he's showcased an extremely fluid, energetic brand of football. Italian legend Fabio Capello believes there is a heavy Spanish tactical influence on Motta's approach, following his time as a player there with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. However, having worked under Mourinho and cult coaching figure Gian Piero Gasperini, it's clear Motta has looked to take something from every coach he's worked with. The versatility and flexibility in his approach must be admired.

If Juventus are to break away from the Massimiliano Allegri era, there wouldn't be a coach more further removed from the Italian's gruelling on the eye style. A young squad with high technical ability as well as strong physical characteristics is clearly when Motta does his best work. -- Cartlidge

Style of play: Slot is a 4-3-3 coach, which is a key factor in his emergence as Liverpool's choice to succeed Klopp as manager at Anfield. Feyenoord play an aggressive, high-energy attacking brand of football and, again like Liverpool, play to win possession quickly when losing the ball in the attacking third of the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Domestically, Slot's biggest success was guiding Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title -- the club's second Dutch championship this century -- in 2022-23. Guiding the Rotterdam-based team to the Europa Conference League final in 2022, before losing to Mourinho's Roma in Tirana, embellished his reputation on the European stage.

Clubs linked with: Slot was mentioned in relation to a string of clubs (from Leeds United to Tottenham, Chelsea and Bayern Munich) but he is expected to be announced as Liverpool's new manager in the coming days.

Slot had an unremarkable career as a midfielder, making more than 450 appearances in the Netherlands with four different clubs, but he never made it to one of the Eredivisie's big three (Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV Eindhoven). Regarded as a player with passing vision and creativity rather than a physical, box-to-box midfielder, Slot started his coaching career as a youth coach with PEC Zwolle after ending his playing days in 2013. But his coaching career has been a slow burn, with Slot moving to second division side Cambuur after a year at Zwolle, becoming an assistant to a succession of coaches before being appointed joint-coach with Sipke Hulshoff in October 2016.

Despite guiding Cambuur to the Dutch Cup semifinals for the first time in 2017, Slot relinquished his joint-manager role to take another assistant coach position at AZ Alkmaar and it wasn't until the start of the 2019-20 season that he would be appointed as head coach, when he stepped up at AZ following the departure of John van den Brom. With his first season halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Slot was then fired by AZ in December 2020 after negotiating a deal to join Feyenoord. Although his time in Alkmaar was relatively brief, his average haul of 2.11 points per game was the highest in AZ's Eredivisie history.

Slot's 3½ years at Feyenoord have coincided with a revival of the club's fortunes, with success in the league and cup as well as the run to the Europa Conference League final, but he will move to Liverpool having managed just six games in the Champions League, losing four and winning two.

Unlike fellow Dutch coach Erik ten Hag, who left Ajax for Manchester United in 2022, Slot is an ebullient character, fluent in English and one who prioritises creating a bond with the supporters of the club he coaches. In that respect, he shares characteristics with the man he will replace at Liverpool, Klopp, but he will head to Anfield with a clear lack of experience at the highest level of the game. -- Ogden",espn.com.au,news,ESPN.com,,0.2549019607843137,453393635,10,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0508%2Fsoccer_elite_managers_16x9.jpg,

However, if you take a look at the dugouts around the Champions League, Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and Primeira Liga, you'll see a whole crop of coaches who could one day be the next world-famous figureheads of elite teams.

Some have already won league titles and major trophies with their current clubs, while others have shown they can compete with, and even beat, the traditional powerhouses despite working with less-heralded players and fewer resources. They might have taken all the knowledge and wisdom gleaned from the world's best coaches during glittering playing careers and applied it successfully to their own managerial styles, or they could have soaked up all they know from the sideline having failed to make the grade on the pitch.

But all of them have put themselves in the conversation for a job at one or more of the biggest clubs in Europe whenever they make their next moves. Who will replace Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich this summer? Or fill the shoes of Carlo Ancelotti when he inevitably steps down as Real Madrid boss?

Here is a look at Slot and 10 other managers who could soon be joining him at football's top table, with details on their signature styles of play, their biggest achievements to date and which clubs they have already been linked with.

Style of play: Attacking football with a lot of movement, a high defensive line and a lot of possession in a 3-4-2-1 formation most of the time.

Biggest achievement to date: Have you watched Leverkusen this season? Alonso & Co. won the Bundesliga title this year with a few games to spare in his first full season as a manager. His team is also in the German Cup final and the Europa League final later this month while still unbeaten in 50 games so far this season.

Clubs linked with: Liverpool and Bayern Munich wanted him badly, while Real Madrid eye him as the successor of Carlo Ancelotti when he will decide to leave. But Alonso chose to stay at Leverkusen for at least another season.

Since Pep Guardiola, we have never seen a manager be so successful in his first full season at a top club. While Guardiola had Lionel Messi and a stellar squad to call upon at Barcelona, Xabi Alonso pretty much had to do it all himself. He took over at the Bayer Arena from Gerardo Seoane when the team was 17th in the table in October 2022 and in crisis. Prior to joining, he'd only managed the Real Sociedad reserve team by then (with mixed results and an average points per game of 1.5 and a 40% win ratio), though his reputation and stock were both sky-high.

When you were one of the best players of your generation with one of the highest football IQs, and you'd been coached by Rafael Benitez, José Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti during your career, you may have seemed destined to becoming a top manager like Mourinho himself tipped Alonso to be. And it's fair to say he's already making history with this incredible 2023-24 season.

His team plays an exciting style of football that he has perfectly implemented with his squad. His recruitment (Victor Boniface, Ale Grimaldo, Granit Xhaka, Nathan Tella, to name just four) has been great, and he's drilled into his squad the same spirit that Alonso himself displayed when Liverpool won the Champions League in Istanbul back in 2005. Leverkusen have been the kings of late goals and late comebacks this season thanks to the mentality instilled by their fantastic manager. -- Julien Laurens

Style of play: Amorim is committed to a 3-4-3 system, anchored at the back by former Liverpool defender Sebastián Coates, with wing-backs expected to cover the entirety of their flanks. In midfield, Amorim deploys two box-to-box midfielders behind a front three led by a traditional No. 9. This season, Sweden forward Viktor Gyökeres has helped to deliver the Portuguese title with 27 goals and 10 assists in 32 games.

Biggest achievement to date: Amorim ended Sporting's 19-year wait for a domestic title in 2020-21 and broke the Benfica-Porto duopoly in the Primeira Liga. He has backed that up by winning the title again this season.

Clubs linked with: Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, West Ham United

Amorim is the rising star of Portuguese coaching and is tipped to follow the likes of José Mourinho, André Villas-Boas, Marco Silva and Nuno Espírito Santo by securing a job in one of Europe's most high-profile leagues. The former Benfica and Portugal midfielder said this month that he was committed to one more season at Sporting after guiding the team to the Primeira Liga title. But having been high on the wanted list of Liverpool and West Ham, Amorim could yet be prised away from the Lisbon club this summer if a team is prepared to pay his €15m release clause.

Amorim is a strong character all too willing to defy authority. During his playing days at Benfica, he clashed with coach Jorge Jesus over team selection and refused to train with the nonplaying squad. During his first coaching job at third-tier Casa Pia, Amorim was given a one-year suspension by the Portuguese Football Federation for giving match instructions without having the coaching qualifications to do so; although the suspension was subsequently lifted, he resigned from his post.

His big break came with Braga, where he won the Taça de Portugal in 2021 with victory against Porto in the final before Sporting triggered a €10m release clause to hire him as coach. Amorim's eye for talent saw Sporting sign Pedro Porro, João Palhinha and João Mário before ending the club's lengthy title drought. Amorim also won the domestic cup again with Sporting, and was sent to the stands for arguing with opposition coach Carlos Carvalhal on the touchline.

Amorim's success in overcoming Benfica and Porto to establish Sporting as Portugal's top team has made him the target of many top clubs, but his refusal to compromise on his 3-4-3 system could prove to be a weakness as much as a strength going forward. -- Mark Ogden

Style of play: Fast, direct, aggressive football, pressing high and keeping a high defensive line. In Portugal's Primeira Liga, Porto dominate possession and play on the front foot, but as they showed against Arsenal in the Champions League this season, they're also willing to be ruthlessly pragmatic.

Biggest achievement to date: Porto hadn't won the league in four years when Conceição took over in 2017, with Benfica threatening to match Porto's record of five in a row. Conceição changed all that. Despite UEFA-imposed Financial Fair Play restrictions that severely limited their ability in the transfer market, Porto won the league at a canter in 2017-18, with two more titles in 2020 and 2022. He has also led them to the Champions League quarterfinals twice, going toe-to-toe with bigger clubs.

Clubs linked with: Conceição was linked to AC Milan in early May. A source told ESPN that he was ready to move from Porto this summer after seven years in charge, targeting a big club in Europe's top five leagues.

Conceição made his name as a hardworking Serie A winger in the late 90s, playing for Lazio as well as Parma and Inter Milan, and working with coaches Sven-Göran Eriksson and Hector Cuper. He starred for Portugal at Euro 2000 and briefly worked under Mourinho at Porto before retiring in 2009 and turning to coaching. After some stormy, brief managerial spells, his time at Porto has been an unequivocal success.

Conceição has won 10 trophies with Porto, a tally only Jorge Jesus can match in Portuguese football, and holds the Portuguese record for most points won in a season, 91. He is demanding, intense and passionate, and that's reflected in his teams. ""Porto are like their coach,"" Diego Simeone -- who also played alongside Conceição at Lazio -- said in 2022. ""They're enthusiastic, they're alive, they're energetic. They're intense in attack and defence. They work together and that makes them competitive.""

Conceição has dealt effectively with Porto's limited resources and often idiosyncratic senior management, helping develop young players who often move to big clubs for a significant profit: think Éder Militão (Real Madrid), Luis Díaz (Liverpool), Fabio Vieira (Arsenal) and Vitinha (PSG), among many others.

Conceição signed a new contract at Porto last month, but a source has told ESPN that he has the right to release himself from that deal if he wishes. He would like to take over a club with a more realistic chance of winning the Champions League, and which has a more clearly defined, professional structure in which the coach can focus on coaching. -- Alex Kirkland

Style of play: As he told ESPN last year, De Zerbi's philosophy is: ""I like to keep the ball, to enjoy the ball, to try every game to be protagonists on the pitch, working with passion, working with ambition and working towards a dream."" Brighton forward Danny Welbeck, meanwhile, says: ""Everybody has to be in sync.""

De Zerbi's formations switch between 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2, but whichever setup he uses, it revolves around the ability to build up from the back and transition quickly to the opposition box, swarming, pressing and playing with high intensity.

Biggest achievement to date: Guiding Sassuolo into the top eight of Serie A across both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons was a remarkable achievement, but taking Brighton to sixth in the Premier League last season and qualifying them for the Europa League tops the bill.

Clubs linked with: De Zerbi has been linked with most of the top jobs in Europe, from Bayern to Barcelona. His name has also been mentioned in connection with Liverpool, Chelsea (where uncertainty continues to surround Mauricio Pochettino), Juventus and Napoli.

Pep Guardiola has long been a De Zerbi evangelist. When he joined Brighton back in September 2022, Guardiola said the Italian was ""changing many things in English football."" The feeling is mutual; De Zerbi has taken inspiration from Guardiola, too. The players themselves talk about De Zerbi's ability to motivate them and his midmatch tactical tweaks. They see the passion he exudes on the touchline, as well as the ease with which he can shift his teams into different formations. Fundamentally, his teams try to suffocate opponents, building up from the back with Guardiola previously hailing the way De Zerbi's team progresses from goalkeeper to the final third in a blink of an eye.

De Zerbi's playing career saw him start with AC Milan and live a nomadic life on loan across Italy, primarily playing in Serie B. His coaching career began with a short-lived spell at Palermo, but it was at Sassuolo where he earned his reputation by leading them twice to a top-half finish in Serie A. There he lived and slept football, having a notepad by the side of his bed in case some tactical inspiration slipped into a dream.

He joined Shakhtar Donetsk in 2021 but left in July 2022 as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ended up taking charge of Brighton early in the 2022-23 campaign. He led the Seagulls to sixth in the Premier League, qualification for Europa League and last season's FA Cup semifinal.

This season has been a little tougher at Brighton with their squad stretched because of their run to the Europa League round of 16, and they sit in 10th. After their 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth, De Zerbi bemoaned the injuries they've suffered but also the squad's lack of motivation. ""In this moment, too many points from European qualification, we are working for an unclear target, but I can't accept a game without soul,"" he said.

De Zerbi has asked for clarity over his future and the club's ambitions, saying back in March that he was keen to hold talks -- his contract runs through 2026. But then he was vague in April regarding his future. ""I have not decided to leave, it is not the right time yet to decide anything,"" he said. The indication is that Brighton expects him to stay, but the relationship is more strained. His summer prospects are probably dependent on (a) which jobs are available and (b) his relationship with Brighton. -- Tom Hamilton

Style of play: In his first foray into coaching, Farioli developed a reputation in Turkey for risk-filled attacking play. He has shown more defensive acumen since arriving in France in 2023 in an encouraging sign that he is becoming a more balanced coach. The Italian also has shown he likes a 3-4-3 formation, asking his defensive midfielder to drop into the backline as the full-backs push forward.

Biggest achievement to date: Without a doubt becoming the youngest coach in a top-tier European league. At 31 years old, he took over at Fatih Karagümrük in March 2021 before landing a major job, again in Turkey, with Alanyaspor in December of the same year.

Clubs linked with: Farioli has seen his name touted among clubs back in Italy such as Milan and Napoli in addition to elsewhere around Europe, with Ajax and Manchester United also mentioned. Last summer, there were also links with Championship side Sunderland as they looked for a bright young coach to guide their own group of fledglings.

Farioli's first steps into the game were as an assistant to Brighton boss De Zerbi. A member of De Zerbi's technical team at Benevento reached out to Farioli after reading an article he wrote for scouting platform WyScout. De Zerbi initially brought Farioli in as his goalkeeping coach and had him by his side at both Benevento and Sassuolo. Farioli's first proper coaching job came at age 31 with Fatih Karagümrük. There, his ultra-attacking style caught the eye of Alanyaspor, who hired him in December of the same year.

Nice were similarly impressed and placed him in charge of a young first-team squad. Since being at the French club, Farioli has added some defensive nous, though it has come at the expense of some attacking vibrance. Farioli also has shown a desire for his full-backs to not only become inverted (moving centrally and overloading the midfield while in possession) but also provide overlaps, while requiring his goalkeeper and centre-backs to be confident in possession.

Nice went unbeaten this season until December, and they have managed wins away at both Monaco and PSG. They're still in hot contention for European football next season, sitting fifth (and automatic Europa League qualification) with a four-point gap to fourth-place Brest and two games left. (If they can finish fourth, that would put them in the Champions League).

As the man himself stated, ""When Plan A doesn't work, you need a better Plan A,"" confirming Farioli is very much a manager of principles and belief in his philosophy. His coaching influences are also interesting, with Farioli naming the more defensive-minded Arrigo Sacchi and Mourinho as the coaches he looks up to, though he also dropped in his admiration for Guardiola's Barcelona and Johan Cruyff's Ajax. That Farioli has shown his awareness of defending with more responsibility this season, it suggests he is preparing for life at a major club where the demands are greater when it comes to be being flexible tactically. -- David Cartlidge

Style of play: Brentford switch between a 3-5-2 and 4-3-3 formation, both with attacking intentions. They play with pace and verticality, priding themselves on set piece excellence. Under Frank's tactics, their wing-backs get plenty of miles under their belt, not afraid to hit teams on the counter, but are equally adept at focusing play through the middle, with Frank usually favouring a defensive anchor paired with two energetic box-to-box midfielders.

Biggest achievement to date: Brentford's promotion to the Premier League in 2021 was a defining moment with their return to the top flight for the first time in 74 years.

Clubs linked with: Frank has been mentioned as a possible successor to Klopp while also having been named as a possible contender for Manchester United as they weigh up Erik ten Hag's future.

Frank's coaching career started in the youth sides of the Denmark national team setup -- while doubling up as a teacher -- and he worked his way up to managing their under-19 men's team before taking charge of Brøndby in 2013. Over the course of three seasons, he led them into Europe twice before leaving in March 2016. By December of the same year, he was assistant coach at Brentford, charged with bridging the gap between the B team and the first team, before taking over from Dean Smith in October 2018. He led them to the Championship playoff final in 2020 and secured promotion a year later.

In his first season in the Premier League, they finished in 13th. Then they finished ninth last term despite having the lowest wage budget in the league, according to a Capology study. Frank also has adapted brilliantly to Brentford's data-led approach to recruitment, working with the signings brought in. But it is his unflappable nature, his incredible ability to improve players across his squad and his ruthlessly efficient style of high-energy play on the field that has seen him win so many admirers.

""Thomas is a very honest person,"" said Brentford's on-loan left-back Sergio Reguilón. ""I love the way he talks to everyone, to you, the players. I love him.""

Klopp said earlier in the season of Frank: ""He's doing a brilliant job there and seems to be very happy there. A while ago, we had a managers meeting, and he could get there by bike, so he likes life in the area. He's a cool guy. I respect him a lot.""

Frank has managed to weather anything and everything that has been thrown at him, staying calm throughout. ""His strength is his consistency of energy,"" a source told ESPN. ""I'm sure he gets stressed, but he rarely loses it and remains very level-headed.""

That's not to say it's been straightforward. Over the past nine months, he lost first-choice goalkeeper David Raya in the summer and chief goal scorer Ivan Toney to an eight-month suspension for breaching betting rules. But Brentford still have managed to secure their top-flight safety despite having a brutal injury list -- including 29 separate substantial absences for key players -- this season.

Frank is signed up with Brentford through to 2027 and isn't agitating for a move, but it's easy to imagine him somewhere bigger in the future. ""I think we all have kind of an ego, and the ego likes that little bit of sugar, but at the end of the day, I'm at Brentford. I'm very happy here,"" Frank said in February. ""Do I have ambitions? Yes. Am I going to stay at Brentford forever? Maybe, but probably not. What I know is that I'm here at Brentford and I'm very happy with it."" -- Hamilton

Style of play: Lots of verticality, plus quick forward projections and transitions with an aggressive press in a 4-4-2 formation.

Biggest achievement to date: His Stuttgart side is third in the table and he won the third-division title with the Bayern reserve team four years ago.

Clubs linked with: His name was very high on the Bayern Munich shortlist to replace Thomas Tuchel in the summer, but he decided to sign a new deal at Stuttgart.

Hoeneß is not a name easy to carry in Germany. Sebastian will never be the most famous Hoeneß in German football -- that honor goes to his uncle, Uli, for his exploits as a player and Bayern Munich president -- but he is making a (first) name for himself. Outside of Alonso, Hoeneß has been the best coach in the Bundesliga this season, and it's not been close.

After arriving at Stuttgart in April 2023 and finishing 16th, he changed the team and its fortunes completely to make it one of the best in the country. After doing well with the Bayern Munich youth and reserve teams, and a decent first season in charge at Hoffenheim (picking up 1.4 points per game from 2020 to 2022), Stuttgart was a big job, and he rose to the occasion. His team has been super efficient in all areas of the pitch -- in particular their attack, where Serhou Guirassy and Denis Undav have been superb. He made every player improve individually while collectively, his team was resilient and well drilled.

Taking this side into next season's Champions League feels like a trophy for him, though bigger and better things surely await him. Maybe he'll team up with his uncle at Bayern one day, but for now he'll continue building his own path. -- Laurens

Style of play: When McKenna took charge of Ipswich in December 2021, with the team 12th in League One, he made clear his determination to revive the team by instilling a possession-based game at the club. He has retained that philosophy and secured back-to-back promotions.

Biggest achievement to date: McKenna ended Ipswich's 22-year absence from the Premier League by winning promotion from the Championship this season -- an achievement made even more impressive because the team received promotion from League One only 12 months earlier.

Clubs linked with: Brighton, Celtic, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Manchester United.

Having progressed through the youth ranks at Tottenham Hotspur, McKenna was forced to retire at the age of 22 without making a senior appearance as a result of a hip injury. Determined to make a career in football, the Northern Irishman earned a sports science degree at Loughborough University before working as a youth team coach at Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Leicester and the Vancouver Whitecaps.

McKenna returned to Spurs, moving through the coaching ranks to become head of the club's under-18 teams until he was hired by Manchester United to assume the same role at Old Trafford. His work with the United youngsters caught the eye of then-manager Mourinho, who promoted McKenna to first-team coaching duties following the departure of longtime assistant Rui Faria in 2018. When Mourinho was fired in December 2018, incoming manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer retained McKenna within his first-team coaching group.

During Solskjaer's turbulent three-year period in charge, United offered to recruit a more experienced coach to bolster the coaching setup -- both McKenna and fellow coach Michael Carrick were viewed as being novices -- but Solskjaer rejected the proposal, insisting that he had a ""world-class"" coaching team with McKenna and Carrick. Following Solskjaer's exit in November 2021, McKenna worked under interim manager Ralf Rangnick for a month before being hired by Ipswich. His two promotions at Portman Road have earmarked McKenna as a rising star in management, but having secured Premier League football by winning promotion, McKenna is expected to remain at Ipswich next season rather than seeking a move elsewhere.

""I love it here,"" McKenna said as Ipswich celebrated promotion. ""There's some big and exciting steps to come."" -- Ogden

Style of play: Attack-minded, fluid, passing football. Girona are the second-highest scorers in LaLiga this season -- one goal behind Real Madrid -- but that positive approach means they concede goals, too. The team's shape frequently shifts. Michel often favours a back four but can switch to three at the back, depending on the opposition.

Biggest achievement to date: Taking Girona into LaLiga's top four -- at the time of writing they're second, a point ahead of Barcelona -- and, while it lasted, mounting a credible title challenge up against two giants with bigger, better squads and much higher wage bills.

Clubs linked with: Girona's success -- and playing style -- has seen Michel talked about as a future Barca coach. He's also been linked with potential summer vacancies at Manchester United and Chelsea, and Girona's membership of the City Group makes him an obvious candidate to eventually succeed Guardiola.

As a player, Michel was a hero at Rayo Vallecano, a talented midfielder regarded as one of the best players in the modest club's history. As a coach, he made his name at Rayo too, getting them promoted to LaLiga in 2018 before being sacked the next season. He repeated the trick at Huesca the following year, winning them promotion, but failing to see out the campaign in Primera.

At Girona, his profile as a coach has skyrocketed. Having acquired a reputation as a promotion specialist, he was brought in in 2021 and charged with getting Girona back into the first division after two failed attempts. Surviving an early rough patch, they won promotion -- Michel's third as a coach -- through the playoffs.

A solid, midtable finish in 2023 to consolidate Girona's position in the top flight was a prelude to this season's blockbuster campaign. Girona stunned Spanish football by going top of LaLiga last fall and threatening to break up the Madrid/Barca duopoly. They couldn't sustain that title push, unable to keep pace with Madrid in the second half of the season, but it's still been a campaign packed with highlights. Two league wins over Barcelona -- beating them 4-2 home and away -- stand out.

Michel's next challenge will be repeating Girona's success in 2024-25, now that they're no longer a surprise, and -- provided UEFA approve their involvement, given the City connection -- overseeing their debut campaign in the Champions League. -- Kirkland

Style of play: The former Barcelona, Inter and PSG man has become synonymous with a high possession style of play, preaching positive, fluid football that overawes opponents. As with many coaches these days, there is also a strong emphasis on winning back the ball high up the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Not only did Bologna secure a European place for the first time in 22 years, but the Rossoblù will be making that bow in the Champions League no less.

Clubs linked with: Juventus are the club to which he's most often linked, and many reports have gone as far as to suggest a deal has already been struck to land Motta. Chelsea and Manchester United are the others mentioned.

Motta's success has not been without a few bumps in the road. His first job at Genoa ended with him being fired after the club slumped to last place in Serie A. At Spezia, however, he showed more of his burgeoning talent as a coach. Despite nearly sacking him, the club persisted with Motta, who repaid them by helping Spezia escape relegation.

Bologna has been nothing but a major success for Motta, however, where he's showcased an extremely fluid, energetic brand of football. Italian legend Fabio Capello believes there is a heavy Spanish tactical influence on Motta's approach, following his time as a player there with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. However, having worked under Mourinho and cult coaching figure Gian Piero Gasperini, it's clear Motta has looked to take something from every coach he's worked with. The versatility and flexibility in his approach must be admired.

If Juventus are to break away from the Massimiliano Allegri era, there wouldn't be a coach more further removed from the Italian's gruelling on the eye style. A young squad with high technical ability as well as strong physical characteristics is clearly when Motta does his best work. -- Cartlidge

Style of play: Slot is a 4-3-3 coach, which is a key factor in his emergence as Liverpool's choice to succeed Klopp as manager at Anfield. Feyenoord play an aggressive, high-energy attacking brand of football and, again like Liverpool, play to win possession quickly when losing the ball in the attacking third of the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Domestically, Slot's biggest success was guiding Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title -- the club's second Dutch championship this century -- in 2022-23. Guiding the Rotterdam-based team to the Europa Conference League final in 2022, before losing to Mourinho's Roma in Tirana, embellished his reputation on the European stage.

Clubs linked with: Slot was mentioned in relation to a string of clubs (from Leeds United to Tottenham, Chelsea and Bayern Munich) but he is expected to be announced as Liverpool's new manager in the coming days.

Slot had an unremarkable career as a midfielder, making more than 450 appearances in the Netherlands with four different clubs, but he never made it to one of the Eredivisie's big three (Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV Eindhoven). Regarded as a player with passing vision and creativity rather than a physical, box-to-box midfielder, Slot started his coaching career as a youth coach with PEC Zwolle after ending his playing days in 2013. But his coaching career has been a slow burn, with Slot moving to second division side Cambuur after a year at Zwolle, becoming an assistant to a succession of coaches before being appointed joint-coach with Sipke Hulshoff in October 2016.

Despite guiding Cambuur to the Dutch Cup semifinals for the first time in 2017, Slot relinquished his joint-manager role to take another assistant coach position at AZ Alkmaar and it wasn't until the start of the 2019-20 season that he would be appointed as head coach, when he stepped up at AZ following the departure of John van den Brom. With his first season halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Slot was then fired by AZ in December 2020 after negotiating a deal to join Feyenoord. Although his time in Alkmaar was relatively brief, his average haul of 2.11 points per game was the highest in AZ's Eredivisie history.

Slot's 3½ years at Feyenoord have coincided with a revival of the club's fortunes, with success in the league and cup as well as the run to the Europa Conference League final, but he will move to Liverpool having managed just six games in the Champions League, losing four and winning two.

Unlike fellow Dutch coach Erik ten Hag, who left Ajax for Manchester United in 2022, Slot is an ebullient character, fluent in English and one who prioritises creating a bond with the supporters of the club he coaches. In that respect, he shares characteristics with the man he will replace at Liverpool, Klopp, but he will head to Anfield with a clear lack of experience at the highest level of the game. -- Ogden",espn.co.uk,news,ESPN.com,,0.2549019607843137,453393267,10,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0508%2Fsoccer_elite_managers_16x9.jpg,

However, if you take a look at the dugouts around the Champions League, Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and Primeira Liga, you'll see a whole crop of coaches who could one day be the next world-famous figureheads of elite teams.

Some have already won league titles and major trophies with their current clubs, while others have shown they can compete with, and even beat, the traditional powerhouses despite working with less-heralded players and fewer resources. They might have taken all the knowledge and wisdom gleaned from the world's best coaches during glittering playing careers and applied it successfully to their own managerial styles, or they could have soaked up all they know from the sideline having failed to make the grade on the pitch.

But all of them have put themselves in the conversation for a job at one or more of the biggest clubs in Europe whenever they make their next moves. Who will replace Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich this summer? Or fill the shoes of Carlo Ancelotti when he inevitably steps down as Real Madrid boss?

Here is a look at Slot and 10 other managers who could soon be joining him at football's top table, with details on their signature styles of play, their biggest achievements to date and which clubs they have already been linked with.

Style of play: Attacking football with a lot of movement, a high defensive line and a lot of possession in a 3-4-2-1 formation most of the time.

Biggest achievement to date: Have you watched Leverkusen this season? Alonso & Co. won the Bundesliga title this year with a few games to spare in his first full season as a manager. His team is also in the German Cup final and the Europa League final later this month while still unbeaten in 50 games so far this season.

Clubs linked with: Liverpool and Bayern Munich wanted him badly, while Real Madrid eye him as the successor of Carlo Ancelotti when he will decide to leave. But Alonso chose to stay at Leverkusen for at least another season.

Since Pep Guardiola, we have never seen a manager be so successful in his first full season at a top club. While Guardiola had Lionel Messi and a stellar squad to call upon at Barcelona, Xabi Alonso pretty much had to do it all himself. He took over at the Bayer Arena from Gerardo Seoane when the team was 17th in the table in October 2022 and in crisis. Prior to joining, he'd only managed the Real Sociedad reserve team by then (with mixed results and an average points per game of 1.5 and a 40% win ratio), though his reputation and stock were both sky-high.

When you were one of the best players of your generation with one of the highest football IQs, and you'd been coached by Rafael Benitez, José Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti during your career, you may have seemed destined to becoming a top manager like Mourinho himself tipped Alonso to be. And it's fair to say he's already making history with this incredible 2023-24 season.

His team plays an exciting style of football that he has perfectly implemented with his squad. His recruitment (Victor Boniface, Ale Grimaldo, Granit Xhaka, Nathan Tella, to name just four) has been great, and he's drilled into his squad the same spirit that Alonso himself displayed when Liverpool won the Champions League in Istanbul back in 2005. Leverkusen have been the kings of late goals and late comebacks this season thanks to the mentality instilled by their fantastic manager. -- Julien Laurens

Style of play: Amorim is committed to a 3-4-3 system, anchored at the back by former Liverpool defender Sebastián Coates, with wing-backs expected to cover the entirety of their flanks. In midfield, Amorim deploys two box-to-box midfielders behind a front three led by a traditional No. 9. This season, Sweden forward Viktor Gyökeres has helped to deliver the Portuguese title with 27 goals and 10 assists in 32 games.

Biggest achievement to date: Amorim ended Sporting's 19-year wait for a domestic title in 2020-21 and broke the Benfica-Porto duopoly in the Primeira Liga. He has backed that up by winning the title again this season.

Clubs linked with: Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, West Ham United

Amorim is the rising star of Portuguese coaching and is tipped to follow the likes of José Mourinho, André Villas-Boas, Marco Silva and Nuno Espírito Santo by securing a job in one of Europe's most high-profile leagues. The former Benfica and Portugal midfielder said this month that he was committed to one more season at Sporting after guiding the team to the Primeira Liga title. But having been high on the wanted list of Liverpool and West Ham, Amorim could yet be prised away from the Lisbon club this summer if a team is prepared to pay his €15m release clause.

Amorim is a strong character all too willing to defy authority. During his playing days at Benfica, he clashed with coach Jorge Jesus over team selection and refused to train with the nonplaying squad. During his first coaching job at third-tier Casa Pia, Amorim was given a one-year suspension by the Portuguese Football Federation for giving match instructions without having the coaching qualifications to do so; although the suspension was subsequently lifted, he resigned from his post.

His big break came with Braga, where he won the Taça de Portugal in 2021 with victory against Porto in the final before Sporting triggered a €10m release clause to hire him as coach. Amorim's eye for talent saw Sporting sign Pedro Porro, João Palhinha and João Mário before ending the club's lengthy title drought. Amorim also won the domestic cup again with Sporting, and was sent to the stands for arguing with opposition coach Carlos Carvalhal on the touchline.

Amorim's success in overcoming Benfica and Porto to establish Sporting as Portugal's top team has made him the target of many top clubs, but his refusal to compromise on his 3-4-3 system could prove to be a weakness as much as a strength going forward. -- Mark Ogden

Style of play: Fast, direct, aggressive football, pressing high and keeping a high defensive line. In Portugal's Primeira Liga, Porto dominate possession and play on the front foot, but as they showed against Arsenal in the Champions League this season, they're also willing to be ruthlessly pragmatic.

Biggest achievement to date: Porto hadn't won the league in four years when Conceição took over in 2017, with Benfica threatening to match Porto's record of five in a row. Conceição changed all that. Despite UEFA-imposed Financial Fair Play restrictions that severely limited their ability in the transfer market, Porto won the league at a canter in 2017-18, with two more titles in 2020 and 2022. He has also led them to the Champions League quarterfinals twice, going toe-to-toe with bigger clubs.

Clubs linked with: Conceição was linked to AC Milan in early May. A source told ESPN that he was ready to move from Porto this summer after seven years in charge, targeting a big club in Europe's top five leagues.

Conceição made his name as a hardworking Serie A winger in the late 90s, playing for Lazio as well as Parma and Inter Milan, and working with coaches Sven-Göran Eriksson and Hector Cuper. He starred for Portugal at Euro 2000 and briefly worked under Mourinho at Porto before retiring in 2009 and turning to coaching. After some stormy, brief managerial spells, his time at Porto has been an unequivocal success.

Conceição has won 10 trophies with Porto, a tally only Jorge Jesus can match in Portuguese football, and holds the Portuguese record for most points won in a season, 91. He is demanding, intense and passionate, and that's reflected in his teams. ""Porto are like their coach,"" Diego Simeone -- who also played alongside Conceição at Lazio -- said in 2022. ""They're enthusiastic, they're alive, they're energetic. They're intense in attack and defence. They work together and that makes them competitive.""

Conceição has dealt effectively with Porto's limited resources and often idiosyncratic senior management, helping develop young players who often move to big clubs for a significant profit: think Éder Militão (Real Madrid), Luis Díaz (Liverpool), Fabio Vieira (Arsenal) and Vitinha (PSG), among many others.

Conceição signed a new contract at Porto last month, but a source has told ESPN that he has the right to release himself from that deal if he wishes. He would like to take over a club with a more realistic chance of winning the Champions League, and which has a more clearly defined, professional structure in which the coach can focus on coaching. -- Alex Kirkland

Style of play: As he told ESPN last year, De Zerbi's philosophy is: ""I like to keep the ball, to enjoy the ball, to try every game to be protagonists on the pitch, working with passion, working with ambition and working towards a dream."" Brighton forward Danny Welbeck, meanwhile, says: ""Everybody has to be in sync.""

De Zerbi's formations switch between 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2, but whichever setup he uses, it revolves around the ability to build up from the back and transition quickly to the opposition box, swarming, pressing and playing with high intensity.

Biggest achievement to date: Guiding Sassuolo into the top eight of Serie A across both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons was a remarkable achievement, but taking Brighton to sixth in the Premier League last season and qualifying them for the Europa League tops the bill.

Clubs linked with: De Zerbi has been linked with most of the top jobs in Europe, from Bayern to Barcelona. His name has also been mentioned in connection with Liverpool, Chelsea (where uncertainty continues to surround Mauricio Pochettino), Juventus and Napoli.

Pep Guardiola has long been a De Zerbi evangelist. When he joined Brighton back in September 2022, Guardiola said the Italian was ""changing many things in English football."" The feeling is mutual; De Zerbi has taken inspiration from Guardiola, too. The players themselves talk about De Zerbi's ability to motivate them and his midmatch tactical tweaks. They see the passion he exudes on the touchline, as well as the ease with which he can shift his teams into different formations. Fundamentally, his teams try to suffocate opponents, building up from the back with Guardiola previously hailing the way De Zerbi's team progresses from goalkeeper to the final third in a blink of an eye.

De Zerbi's playing career saw him start with AC Milan and live a nomadic life on loan across Italy, primarily playing in Serie B. His coaching career began with a short-lived spell at Palermo, but it was at Sassuolo where he earned his reputation by leading them twice to a top-half finish in Serie A. There he lived and slept football, having a notepad by the side of his bed in case some tactical inspiration slipped into a dream.

He joined Shakhtar Donetsk in 2021 but left in July 2022 as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ended up taking charge of Brighton early in the 2022-23 campaign. He led the Seagulls to sixth in the Premier League, qualification for Europa League and last season's FA Cup semifinal.

This season has been a little tougher at Brighton with their squad stretched because of their run to the Europa League round of 16, and they sit in 10th. After their 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth, De Zerbi bemoaned the injuries they've suffered but also the squad's lack of motivation. ""In this moment, too many points from European qualification, we are working for an unclear target, but I can't accept a game without soul,"" he said.

De Zerbi has asked for clarity over his future and the club's ambitions, saying back in March that he was keen to hold talks -- his contract runs through 2026. But then he was vague in April regarding his future. ""I have not decided to leave, it is not the right time yet to decide anything,"" he said. The indication is that Brighton expects him to stay, but the relationship is more strained. His summer prospects are probably dependent on (a) which jobs are available and (b) his relationship with Brighton. -- Tom Hamilton

Style of play: In his first foray into coaching, Farioli developed a reputation in Turkey for risk-filled attacking play. He has shown more defensive acumen since arriving in France in 2023 in an encouraging sign that he is becoming a more balanced coach. The Italian also has shown he likes a 3-4-3 formation, asking his defensive midfielder to drop into the backline as the full-backs push forward.

Biggest achievement to date: Without a doubt becoming the youngest coach in a top-tier European league. At 31 years old, he took over at Fatih Karagümrük in March 2021 before landing a major job, again in Turkey, with Alanyaspor in December of the same year.

Clubs linked with: Farioli has seen his name touted among clubs back in Italy such as Milan and Napoli in addition to elsewhere around Europe, with Ajax and Manchester United also mentioned. Last summer, there were also links with Championship side Sunderland as they looked for a bright young coach to guide their own group of fledglings.

Farioli's first steps into the game were as an assistant to Brighton boss De Zerbi. A member of De Zerbi's technical team at Benevento reached out to Farioli after reading an article he wrote for scouting platform WyScout. De Zerbi initially brought Farioli in as his goalkeeping coach and had him by his side at both Benevento and Sassuolo. Farioli's first proper coaching job came at age 31 with Fatih Karagümrük. There, his ultra-attacking style caught the eye of Alanyaspor, who hired him in December of the same year.

Nice were similarly impressed and placed him in charge of a young first-team squad. Since being at the French club, Farioli has added some defensive nous, though it has come at the expense of some attacking vibrance. Farioli also has shown a desire for his full-backs to not only become inverted (moving centrally and overloading the midfield while in possession) but also provide overlaps, while requiring his goalkeeper and centre-backs to be confident in possession.

Nice went unbeaten this season until December, and they have managed wins away at both Monaco and PSG. They're still in hot contention for European football next season, sitting fifth (and automatic Europa League qualification) with a four-point gap to fourth-place Brest and two games left. (If they can finish fourth, that would put them in the Champions League).

As the man himself stated, ""When Plan A doesn't work, you need a better Plan A,"" confirming Farioli is very much a manager of principles and belief in his philosophy. His coaching influences are also interesting, with Farioli naming the more defensive-minded Arrigo Sacchi and Mourinho as the coaches he looks up to, though he also dropped in his admiration for Guardiola's Barcelona and Johan Cruyff's Ajax. That Farioli has shown his awareness of defending with more responsibility this season, it suggests he is preparing for life at a major club where the demands are greater when it comes to be being flexible tactically. -- David Cartlidge

Style of play: Brentford switch between a 3-5-2 and 4-3-3 formation, both with attacking intentions. They play with pace and verticality, priding themselves on set piece excellence. Under Frank's tactics, their wing-backs get plenty of miles under their belt, not afraid to hit teams on the counter, but are equally adept at focusing play through the middle, with Frank usually favouring a defensive anchor paired with two energetic box-to-box midfielders.

Biggest achievement to date: Brentford's promotion to the Premier League in 2021 was a defining moment with their return to the top flight for the first time in 74 years.

Clubs linked with: Frank has been mentioned as a possible successor to Klopp while also having been named as a possible contender for Manchester United as they weigh up Erik ten Hag's future.

Frank's coaching career started in the youth sides of the Denmark national team setup -- while doubling up as a teacher -- and he worked his way up to managing their under-19 men's team before taking charge of Brøndby in 2013. Over the course of three seasons, he led them into Europe twice before leaving in March 2016. By December of the same year, he was assistant coach at Brentford, charged with bridging the gap between the B team and the first team, before taking over from Dean Smith in October 2018. He led them to the Championship playoff final in 2020 and secured promotion a year later.

In his first season in the Premier League, they finished in 13th. Then they finished ninth last term despite having the lowest wage budget in the league, according to a Capology study. Frank also has adapted brilliantly to Brentford's data-led approach to recruitment, working with the signings brought in. But it is his unflappable nature, his incredible ability to improve players across his squad and his ruthlessly efficient style of high-energy play on the field that has seen him win so many admirers.

""Thomas is a very honest person,"" said Brentford's on-loan left-back Sergio Reguilón. ""I love the way he talks to everyone, to you, the players. I love him.""

Klopp said earlier in the season of Frank: ""He's doing a brilliant job there and seems to be very happy there. A while ago, we had a managers meeting, and he could get there by bike, so he likes life in the area. He's a cool guy. I respect him a lot.""

Frank has managed to weather anything and everything that has been thrown at him, staying calm throughout. ""His strength is his consistency of energy,"" a source told ESPN. ""I'm sure he gets stressed, but he rarely loses it and remains very level-headed.""

That's not to say it's been straightforward. Over the past nine months, he lost first-choice goalkeeper David Raya in the summer and chief goal scorer Ivan Toney to an eight-month suspension for breaching betting rules. But Brentford still have managed to secure their top-flight safety despite having a brutal injury list -- including 29 separate substantial absences for key players -- this season.

Frank is signed up with Brentford through to 2027 and isn't agitating for a move, but it's easy to imagine him somewhere bigger in the future. ""I think we all have kind of an ego, and the ego likes that little bit of sugar, but at the end of the day, I'm at Brentford. I'm very happy here,"" Frank said in February. ""Do I have ambitions? Yes. Am I going to stay at Brentford forever? Maybe, but probably not. What I know is that I'm here at Brentford and I'm very happy with it."" -- Hamilton

Style of play: Lots of verticality, plus quick forward projections and transitions with an aggressive press in a 4-4-2 formation.

Biggest achievement to date: His Stuttgart side is third in the table and he won the third-division title with the Bayern reserve team four years ago.

Clubs linked with: His name was very high on the Bayern Munich shortlist to replace Thomas Tuchel in the summer, but he decided to sign a new deal at Stuttgart.

Hoeneß is not a name easy to carry in Germany. Sebastian will never be the most famous Hoeneß in German football -- that honor goes to his uncle, Uli, for his exploits as a player and Bayern Munich president -- but he is making a (first) name for himself. Outside of Alonso, Hoeneß has been the best coach in the Bundesliga this season, and it's not been close.

After arriving at Stuttgart in April 2023 and finishing 16th, he changed the team and its fortunes completely to make it one of the best in the country. After doing well with the Bayern Munich youth and reserve teams, and a decent first season in charge at Hoffenheim (picking up 1.4 points per game from 2020 to 2022), Stuttgart was a big job, and he rose to the occasion. His team has been super efficient in all areas of the pitch -- in particular their attack, where Serhou Guirassy and Denis Undav have been superb. He made every player improve individually while collectively, his team was resilient and well drilled.

Taking this side into next season's Champions League feels like a trophy for him, though bigger and better things surely await him. Maybe he'll team up with his uncle at Bayern one day, but for now he'll continue building his own path. -- Laurens

Style of play: When McKenna took charge of Ipswich in December 2021, with the team 12th in League One, he made clear his determination to revive the team by instilling a possession-based game at the club. He has retained that philosophy and secured back-to-back promotions.

Biggest achievement to date: McKenna ended Ipswich's 22-year absence from the Premier League by winning promotion from the Championship this season -- an achievement made even more impressive because the team received promotion from League One only 12 months earlier.

Clubs linked with: Brighton, Celtic, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, Manchester United.

Having progressed through the youth ranks at Tottenham Hotspur, McKenna was forced to retire at the age of 22 without making a senior appearance as a result of a hip injury. Determined to make a career in football, the Northern Irishman earned a sports science degree at Loughborough University before working as a youth team coach at Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Leicester and the Vancouver Whitecaps.

McKenna returned to Spurs, moving through the coaching ranks to become head of the club's under-18 teams until he was hired by Manchester United to assume the same role at Old Trafford. His work with the United youngsters caught the eye of then-manager Mourinho, who promoted McKenna to first-team coaching duties following the departure of longtime assistant Rui Faria in 2018. When Mourinho was fired in December 2018, incoming manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer retained McKenna within his first-team coaching group.

During Solskjaer's turbulent three-year period in charge, United offered to recruit a more experienced coach to bolster the coaching setup -- both McKenna and fellow coach Michael Carrick were viewed as being novices -- but Solskjaer rejected the proposal, insisting that he had a ""world-class"" coaching team with McKenna and Carrick. Following Solskjaer's exit in November 2021, McKenna worked under interim manager Ralf Rangnick for a month before being hired by Ipswich. His two promotions at Portman Road have earmarked McKenna as a rising star in management, but having secured Premier League football by winning promotion, McKenna is expected to remain at Ipswich next season rather than seeking a move elsewhere.

""I love it here,"" McKenna said as Ipswich celebrated promotion. ""There's some big and exciting steps to come."" -- Ogden

Style of play: Attack-minded, fluid, passing football. Girona are the second-highest scorers in LaLiga this season -- one goal behind Real Madrid -- but that positive approach means they concede goals, too. The team's shape frequently shifts. Michel often favours a back four but can switch to three at the back, depending on the opposition.

Biggest achievement to date: Taking Girona into LaLiga's top four -- at the time of writing they're second, a point ahead of Barcelona -- and, while it lasted, mounting a credible title challenge up against two giants with bigger, better squads and much higher wage bills.

Clubs linked with: Girona's success -- and playing style -- has seen Michel talked about as a future Barca coach. He's also been linked with potential summer vacancies at Manchester United and Chelsea, and Girona's membership of the City Group makes him an obvious candidate to eventually succeed Guardiola.

As a player, Michel was a hero at Rayo Vallecano, a talented midfielder regarded as one of the best players in the modest club's history. As a coach, he made his name at Rayo too, getting them promoted to LaLiga in 2018 before being sacked the next season. He repeated the trick at Huesca the following year, winning them promotion, but failing to see out the campaign in Primera.

At Girona, his profile as a coach has skyrocketed. Having acquired a reputation as a promotion specialist, he was brought in in 2021 and charged with getting Girona back into the first division after two failed attempts. Surviving an early rough patch, they won promotion -- Michel's third as a coach -- through the playoffs.

A solid, midtable finish in 2023 to consolidate Girona's position in the top flight was a prelude to this season's blockbuster campaign. Girona stunned Spanish football by going top of LaLiga last fall and threatening to break up the Madrid/Barca duopoly. They couldn't sustain that title push, unable to keep pace with Madrid in the second half of the season, but it's still been a campaign packed with highlights. Two league wins over Barcelona -- beating them 4-2 home and away -- stand out.

Michel's next challenge will be repeating Girona's success in 2024-25, now that they're no longer a surprise, and -- provided UEFA approve their involvement, given the City connection -- overseeing their debut campaign in the Champions League. -- Kirkland

Style of play: The former Barcelona, Inter and PSG man has become synonymous with a high possession style of play, preaching positive, fluid football that overawes opponents. As with many coaches these days, there is also a strong emphasis on winning back the ball high up the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Not only did Bologna secure a European place for the first time in 22 years, but the Rossoblù will be making that bow in the Champions League no less.

Clubs linked with: Juventus are the club to which he's most often linked, and many reports have gone as far as to suggest a deal has already been struck to land Motta. Chelsea and Manchester United are the others mentioned.

Motta's success has not been without a few bumps in the road. His first job at Genoa ended with him being fired after the club slumped to last place in Serie A. At Spezia, however, he showed more of his burgeoning talent as a coach. Despite nearly sacking him, the club persisted with Motta, who repaid them by helping Spezia escape relegation.

Bologna has been nothing but a major success for Motta, however, where he's showcased an extremely fluid, energetic brand of football. Italian legend Fabio Capello believes there is a heavy Spanish tactical influence on Motta's approach, following his time as a player there with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. However, having worked under Mourinho and cult coaching figure Gian Piero Gasperini, it's clear Motta has looked to take something from every coach he's worked with. The versatility and flexibility in his approach must be admired.

If Juventus are to break away from the Massimiliano Allegri era, there wouldn't be a coach more further removed from the Italian's gruelling on the eye style. A young squad with high technical ability as well as strong physical characteristics is clearly when Motta does his best work. -- Cartlidge

Style of play: Slot is a 4-3-3 coach, which is a key factor in his emergence as Liverpool's choice to succeed Klopp as manager at Anfield. Feyenoord play an aggressive, high-energy attacking brand of football and, again like Liverpool, play to win possession quickly when losing the ball in the attacking third of the pitch.

Biggest achievement to date: Domestically, Slot's biggest success was guiding Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title -- the club's second Dutch championship this century -- in 2022-23. Guiding the Rotterdam-based team to the Europa Conference League final in 2022, before losing to Mourinho's Roma in Tirana, embellished his reputation on the European stage.

Clubs linked with: Slot was mentioned in relation to a string of clubs (from Leeds United to Tottenham, Chelsea and Bayern Munich) but he is expected to be announced as Liverpool's new manager in the coming days.

Slot had an unremarkable career as a midfielder, making more than 450 appearances in the Netherlands with four different clubs, but he never made it to one of the Eredivisie's big three (Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV Eindhoven). Regarded as a player with passing vision and creativity rather than a physical, box-to-box midfielder, Slot started his coaching career as a youth coach with PEC Zwolle after ending his playing days in 2013. But his coaching career has been a slow burn, with Slot moving to second division side Cambuur after a year at Zwolle, becoming an assistant to a succession of coaches before being appointed joint-coach with Sipke Hulshoff in October 2016.

Despite guiding Cambuur to the Dutch Cup semifinals for the first time in 2017, Slot relinquished his joint-manager role to take another assistant coach position at AZ Alkmaar and it wasn't until the start of the 2019-20 season that he would be appointed as head coach, when he stepped up at AZ following the departure of John van den Brom. With his first season halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Slot was then fired by AZ in December 2020 after negotiating a deal to join Feyenoord. Although his time in Alkmaar was relatively brief, his average haul of 2.11 points per game was the highest in AZ's Eredivisie history.

Slot's 3½ years at Feyenoord have coincided with a revival of the club's fortunes, with success in the league and cup as well as the run to the Europa Conference League final, but he will move to Liverpool having managed just six games in the Champions League, losing four and winning two.

Unlike fellow Dutch coach Erik ten Hag, who left Ajax for Manchester United in 2022, Slot is an ebullient character, fluent in English and one who prioritises creating a bond with the supporters of the club he coaches. In that respect, he shares characteristics with the man he will replace at Liverpool, Klopp, but he will head to Anfield with a clear lack of experience at the highest level of the game. -- Ogden",espn.com,news,ESPN.com,,0.2549019607843137,453392912,10,https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0508%2Fsoccer_elite_managers_16x9.jpg,eng-9578217

All 24 competing nations will once again be permitted to name 26-man squads for the summer after confirmation from UEFA following pressure from numerous international managers and executives.

Some countries have made it clear when their provisional squad will be named - Gareth Southgate is to announce England's on May 21 - but the deadline for final squad submission to UEFA is June 7, a week before the tournament begins.

But who can expect to be on the plane, train, coach, group walk or other alternative means of travel? We have taken a look at the most recent squad named by each nation and tried to fill in the blanks where necessary.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against France (2-0 win) and the Netherlands (2-1 win):

Bernd Leno (Fulham), Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona), Oliver Baumann (Hoffenheim), Antonio Rudiger (Real Madrid), David Raum (Leipzig), Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen), Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich), Robin Koch (Eintracht Frankfurt), Waldemar Anton (Stuttgart), Maximilian Mittelstadt (Stuttgart), Benjamin Henrichs (Leipzig), Pascal Gross (Brighton), Toni Kroos (Real Madrid), Jamal Musiala (Bayern Munich), Chris Fuhrich (Stuttgart), Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen), Ilkay Gundogan (Barcelona), Robert Andrich (Bayer Leverkusen), Kai Havertz (Arsenal), Niclas Fullkrug (Borussia Dortmund), Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich), Maximilian Beier (Hoffenheim), Deniz Undav (Stuttgart).

Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich) is expected to be Germany's starting keeper for the tournament, despite having not featured at international level since their 2022 World Cup exit due to a broken leg and other muscle injuries. Jan-Niklas Beste (Heidenheim), Aleksandar Pavlovic (Bayern Munich) and Felix Nmecha (Borussia Dortmund) were named in their most recent squad but withdrew due to injury.

Neuer, Schlotterbeck, Tah, Aleksandar Pavlovic and Fullkrug have had their inclusions confirmed, with Germany drip-feeding their squad announcements before the full announcement on Thursday.

Gregor Kobel (Borussia Dortmund) missed the last squad but should return, as might Breel Embolo (Monaco) as the striker is back playing again following a cruciate ligament rupture.

Etrit Berisham (Empoli), the 80-cap goalkeeper, has not featured at club level since December due to a loss of form and then injury, while Myrto Uzuni (Granada) has 11 goals in La Liga this season and dropped out of the March squad so should expect a recall.

Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus) withdrew from the last squad due to injury but 13 goals in 25 games for his country make him an automatic pick if available.

Udinese midfielder Lovric sustained a thigh injury in April and has missed the last five Serie A matches, so might not improve on his 33 caps.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Slovakia (2-0 win) and Turkey (6-1 win):

Lucas Hernandez, who ruptured his right ACL within 15 minutes of the 2022 World Cup's first group game, will sit out Euro 2024 with the same injury on his left. Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid) should come back in and Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea) will be desperate to join him.

The uncapped Ian Maatsen (Borussia Dortmund) might hope to break into the squad, as well as two-cap veteran Micky van de Ven (Spurs). Sven Botman (Newcastle) will play no part but Jurrien Timber (Arsenal) might make it.

Last major tournament finish: Beaten on penalties by Argentina in World Cup 2022 quarter-final

Matty Cash (Aston Villa) succumbed to a hamstring injury within 11 minutes of Poland's play-off semi-final win over Estonia, missing the subsequent victory over Wales on penalties; he will at least be in the squad.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Ireland (0-0 draw) and England (2-2 draw):

Koen Casteels (Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton), Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest), Arnaud Bodart (Standard Liege), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Arhur Theate (Rennes), Wout Faes (Leicester), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Olivier Deman (Werder Bremen), Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Koni De Winter (Genoa), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Orel Mangala (Lyon), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Aster Vranckx (Wolfsburg), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Lois Openda (Leipzig), Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Johan Bakayoko (PSV), Michy Batshuayi (Fenerbahce).

Those goalkeeping options are a sorry sight but Domenico Tedesco is ""focusing on players who are in good shape"" so will not consider Thibaut Courtois (Real Madrid) despite his consecutive clean sheets in May. Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City) should await a pleasant phone call, however.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Northern Ireland (1-1 draw) and Colombia (3-2 defeat):

Florin Nita (Gaziantep), Horatiu Moldovan (Atletico Madrid), Stefan Tarnovanu (FCSB), Marian Aioani (Rapid Bucuresti), Andrei Burca (Al-Okhdood), Ionut Nedelcearu (Palermo), Cristian Manea (CFR Cluj), Adrian Rus (Pafos), Andrei Ratiu (Rayo Vallecano), Deian Sorescu (Gaziantep), Radu Dragusin (Spurs), Vasile Mogos (CFR Cluj), Raul Oprut (Hermannstadt), Bogdan Racovitan (Rakow Czestochowa), Nicolae Stanciu (Damac), Razvan Marin (Empoli), Alexandru Cicaldau (Konyaspor), Ianis Hagi (Alaves), Dennis Man (Parma), Valentin Mihaila (Parma), Darius Olaru (FCSB), Marius Marin (Pisa), Olimpiu Morutan (Ankaragucu), Florinel Coman (FCSB), Denis Dragus (Gaziantep), Adrian Sut (FCSB), George Puscas (Bari), Denis Alibec (Muaither), Florin Tanase (Al-Okhdood).

Morutan will not be involved after rupturing his Achilles, while Nicusor Bancu (Universitatea Craiova) pulled out of the March squad but has featured heavily for his club since.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Austria (2-0 defeat) and Norway (1-1 draw):

Marek Rodak (Fulham), Henrich Ravas (New England Revolution), Dominik Takac (Spartak Trnava), Peter Pekarik (Hertha BSC), Norbert Gyomber (Salernitana), David Hancko (Feyenoord), Lubomir Satka (Samsunspor), Denis Vavro (Copenhagen), Vernon De Marco (Hatta), Michal Tomic (Slavia Prague), Adam Obert (Cagliari), Matus Kmet (AS Trencin), Juraj Kucka (Slovan Bratislava), Ondrej Duda (Verona), Patrik Hrosovsky (Genk), Stanislav Lobotka (Napoli), Laszlo Benes (Hamburg), Erik Jirka (Viktoria Plzen), Jakub Kadak (Luzern), Dominik Holly (AS Trencin), Robert Mak (Sydney FC), Robert Bozenik (Boavista), Lukas Haraslin (Sparta Prague), Tomas Suslov (Verona), Ivan Schranz (Slavia Prague), David Strelec (Slovan Bratislava), David Duris (Ascoli), Robert Polievka (Dukla Banska Bystrica), Lubomir Tupta (Slovan Liberec), Leo Sauer (Feyenoord).

Martin Dubravka (Newcastle) and Milan Skriniar (Paris Saint-Germain) should both be drafted in again to help shore up the defence.

There is not a great deal of movement from Ukraine, whose biggest question is whether captain Andriy Yarmolenko (Dynamo Kyiv) has done enough to justify another few caps after an Achilles injury.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Norway (2-1 win) and Armenia (2-1 win):

Jindrich Stanek (Slavia Prague), Vitezslav Jaros (Sturm Graz), Matej Kovar (Bayer Leverkusen), Tomas Holes (Slavia Prague), David Zima (Slavia Prague), Jaroslav Zeleny (Sparta Prague), Ladislav Krejci (Sparta Prague), David Doudera (Slavia Prague), David Jurasek (Hoffenheim), Adam Gabriel (Midtjylland), Robin Hranac (Viktoria Plzen), Tomas Vicek (Slavia Prague), Tomas Soucek (West Ham), Antonin Barak (Fiorentina), Michal Sadilek (Twente), Lukas Provod (Slavia Prague), Ondrej Lingr (Feyenoord), Matej Jurasek (Slavia Prague), Pavel Sulc (Viktoria Plzen), Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen), Adam Hlozek (Bayer Leverkusen), Mojmir Chytil (Slavia Prague), Tomas Chory (Viktoria Plzen).

Vladimir Coufal (West Ham), Jan Kuchta (Sparta Prague) Jakub Brabec (Aris) have not been selected since they were found to have 'fundamentally violated the internal rules of the national team' by drinking in a nightclub shortly before a Euros qualifier in November.

Last squad - named for Euro play-offs against Luxembourg (2-0 win) and Greece (0-0 draw, win on penalties):

There shouldn't be too much change expected on the squad named to secure qualification, with Giorgi Aburjania (Hatayspor) and Saba Lobzhanidze (Atlanta United) and their combined 75 caps on the midfield fringes.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Sweden (5-2 win) and Slovenia (2-0 defeat):

Raphael Guerreiro (Bayern Munich), Francisco Trincao (Sporting), Pedro Neto (Wolves) and Diogo Jota (Liverpool) have all been part of recent squads before withdrawing due to injury. Fernandes might be keeping himself fresh by evading his Manchester United conscription, if we read between Wayne Rooney's lines.

It may have been a difficult season for Everton but only Arsenal's David Raya kept more Premier League clean sheets than Pickford - not bad given it took until October for him to claim his first. Not that he was worried about those early-season wobbles, and in mid-September, with Everton 18th in the nascent league table, he declared: ""I feel like I'm in the best form of my life."" Asked by the Everton matchday programme in April what one rule change he would suggest to improve the game, he said: ""Scrap fouls and let's get on with it."" Pickford's luggage for the World Cup in Qatar two years ago included a large monitor and powerful desktop computer, packed in a bespoke monogrammed case, on which he played Fortnite. ""Just trying to get the best frames and that,"" he explained.

This has been a miserable season for Ramsdale, who has been pushed out of Arsenal's first team by David Raya and after starting their first four league games has appeared in only two more - both against Brentford, Raya's parent club, in the second of which his error led to a goal. He has retained his place in England's squad, and in March Gareth Southgate admitted the situation was ""not ideal"" but that he was ""at this moment in time ... prepared to take that chance"". The 26-year-old will at least be used to life as a back-up goalkeeper - and ways of distracting himself from it. ""Last year myself, Dan who was our player liaison, Adam who works at the training ground and Jonesy the kit man - we completed our Panini sticker albums,"" he said earlier this year. ""Every morning I would be down in their office with them, spending hours swapping stickers.""

After spending the 2022-23 season on loan at Nottingham Forest - much of the second half of it on the sidelines with a thigh injury - Henderson left Manchester United permanently last August to join Crystal Palace, only to then miss almost three months with a hamstring strain. The 27-year-old says he has ""been to hell and back, getting injury after injury"" and with that miserable run apparently over he will be delighted to spend his summer with England even if the prospect of gametime seems remote. ""I'd love to go in any capacity,"" he said in April. ""I'll go and save shots, try and save penalties, help England out in any way."" For three months in 2019 Henderson officially held the world record for ""the fastest time to dress as a goalkeeper (soccer)"" - but his time was smashed that September by the Blue Peter presenter Richie Driss.

The goalkeeper has endured a tough first season in the Premier League after his £19m move from Manchester City, losing his place to Arijanet Muric in March. Last summer he was a shining light for England Under-21s, saving a last-minute penalty to ensure the Three Lions won the European Championships. Despite his difficulties at club level he was called up by Gareth Southgate for a friendly against Belgium after Sam Johnstone withdrew through injury. Trafford was brought up on a farm in Cumbria, something he attributes for his work ethic. ""No one does anything else apart from farming in my family, apart from my older cousin who is a dentist, and even that was a bit frowned upon,"" Trafford told Bolton News.

Branthwaite is both tall (1.95m at last count) and fast, left-footed but good enough with his weaker foot that Carlisle's academy coach thought he favoured his right. He is Carlisle's youngest ever goalscorer and youngest ever captain, both records set in a game against Morecambe when he was 17 years and 138 days old. ""I do have to pinch myself a little bit,"" he said at the time. Two months later he signed for Everton, ending that season with his first two Premier League starts, and there have since been loan spells at Blackburn (rather ruined by an ankle injury) and PSV Eindhoven (""It was a lovely place; nice and relaxed - lots of bikes!""), where he won the KNVB Cup. Add a European Under-21 Championship victory last summer, a full season of first-team, top-flight football and, this March, a first senior international call-up, and he must be seriously troubled by self-inflicted pinch-related bruising.

England's best all-round left back has had a torrid time this year, suffering a ""muscle injury"" in February and was out for several months because of it. Southgate has already accepted that Shaw will probably not be fit or sharp enough to play every tournament game and could be rested for the group stage. ""We know now to play seven matches in a Euros is highly unlikely,"" said Southgate recently, ""but Luke's one of the best left-backs in world football, frankly."" Shaw, who scored a fine goal against Italy in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley, is both defensively sound and enterprising with the ball, and has the versatility to play full-back, wing-back or even as part of a back three (he is deceptively tall at 1.85m).

It's important to remember that Rico Lewis is still a teenager, and whether it is at Manchester City or with England, he is already shining among some of the world's best players. While Lewis has not had the same minutes as some this season, Southgate has learned to trust Pep Guardiola's intuition in bringing through youngsters from the academy. Phil Foden sat on the City bench for years, and it's fair to say Guardiola's patience paid off. ""I have been a manager for 14, 15 years training unbelievable players,"" remarked Guardiola earlier this season. ""To find a player like him playing in the pockets, how he has to move in holding midfield, full-back coming inside moving in the spaces - he is one of the best I ever trained by far."" High praise indeed.

After several years blighted by injuries and spells on the sidelines, for the first time in his career Gomez has made more than 50 appearances this season, playing almost as often at left-back as on the right and with a handful of games in central defence to boot. ""He can play all the positions at the back and that is very important,"" Jürgen Klopp said last year. ""He didn't have a good year last year but he is absolutely back to his best."" Gomez certainly knows how to party: after Liverpool's famous 4-0 win over Barcelona in 2019 he and two friends were up until 4am playing Monopoly. Heaven knows what he would do if he finally scored a senior goal (Klopp had to ask fans to stop imploring him to shoot, saying ""one day he will shoot, let him find the moment himself"" - though by early May - including headers he nearly had as many shots this season (17) as in the last seven combined (18). ""If I wasn't a footballer I would have liked to be a PE teacher,"" he says. ""It's really important, not just for the health benefits but just for having fun. Psychologically it's important that children get a chance to express themselves and sometimes PE is the best way to do that.""

Came through at the famous Senrab FC in London - where Jermain Defoe, Bobby Zamora, Lee Bowyer, Sol Campbell, Ray Wilkins, Alan Curbishley, Ray Lewington, Paul Konchesky, Ugo Ehiogu, Ledley King and John Terry (who also coached him at Villa) all started - before signing for Charlton at 11. After impressing for Aston Villa this season at both centre-back and right-back, Konsa made his England debut in March against Brazil at Wembley, amid rumours that he could have made the switch to Portugal. ""I do have Portuguese in me"", explained Konsa after accepting Southgate's call-up. ""But it was nothing that I was trying to pursue. I was born here and always wanted to play for England.""

Arguably nobody in English football has got more stick since the last European Championships, where Maguire was voted into the team of the tournament alongside teammates Raheem Sterling and Kyle Walker. Increasingly error prone with Manchester United and lacking pace, Maguire looked certain to leave the club last summer but now, after a decent season, few would opt not to include the 1.95m defender in either United or England's squad. Affectionately (we think) nicknamed 'Slabhead' by former Leicester teammate Jamie Vardy for his aerial prowess, especially in England's 'Love Train' corner routine at the 2018 World Cup, Maguire recently learned that his hopes of clearing his name over his alleged role in a Mykonos assault case will be put on hold because of a lawyers' strike in Greece.

Like Kyle Walker, Stones was born in South Yorkshire and learned his trade in the Football League. They were even born on the same date, albeit four years apart. At one point it looked like Stones' City career was over, dropping down the pecking order under Pep Guardiola but he has become integral to the team as a hybrid defender-cum-midfielder, showing his elegance on the ball and intelligent reading of the game. He can often be found gleaming when City win matches, which might explain why he is the new face of an Oral B. ""Feeling confident in how you look and how you smile is super important and should make you feel important and feel the best version of you,"" Stones proclaims in the advert. Euros opponents will need to beware of the pearly whites.

""Kyle at 60 years old will be the fastest player in this room,"" Pep Guardiola says of the right-back but he is about a lot more than pace. The former Sheffield United defender is one of the most intelligent readers of the game at the back, learning under the gaze of Guardiola. His City teammates selected Walker as their new captain for the season, an indication of the respect he commands among his peers. In the qualifying campaign, he finally scored his first goal for his country on his 77th appearance in the 1-1 draw with Ukraine. ""It's just a relief,"" Walker said. ""Now I can tick that off, I've done it, and I've finally got an England goal."" Walker will be 34 years old at the Euros in Germany, his fifth major international tournament. Off-field events do not appear to distract him. ""I made idiot choices and idiot decisions,"" he said in January after news emerged that he had continued with an extramarital affair.

Since England's last international tournament Alexander-Arnold has moved beyond the right-back role, allowed to drift into midfield and across the pitch with Liverpool when his side is in possession, and fielded as a specialist midfielder in several recent international outings. ""I've got no questions in my head. He can do it,"" Gareth Southgate said. ""It's just learning some nuances of the role, without the ball especially, but he's very keen to do it."" To aid his transition Alexander-Arnold has studied current and former players including Rodri, Sergio Busquets, Xabi Alonso and Andrea Pirlo. Last year Alexander-Arnold launched the After Academy, an initiative to help former academy players find work outside football, which is being run in association with the PFA but which he is personally funding - the first jobs were advertised on the site in February.

The second Ivory Coast-born footballer to play for England (after former Palace teammate Wilfried Zaha), the 23-year-old centre-back has evolved into one of the most complete defenders in the league and another example of Chelsea's atrocious transfer record - Guéhi left Stamford Bridge for £18m in 2021 and is now being linked with a summer deal to Liverpool, Manchester United or Liverpool for three times that sum. Football was not the sole focus growing up: Guéhi played the drums and his father was a pastor. ""There were definitely times where I wasn't able to [play] just because God [came] first,"" he said. ""In my house that was the rule.""

This has been a season to forget for Chilwell, who did not play between September and January because of a hamstring injury, and then picked up a knee issue on England duty in March (""We have to manage him carefully because he's been out for a while"", said Southgate, before starting him twice in three days. ""Was I surprised he played twice? Yes, it is maybe a surprise for us,"" said Mauricio Pochettino). Chilwell was a talented junior cricketer - ""I batted at No3 and I was a first-change bowler. Bit of pace,"" he said. ""I was always probably better at cricket, I just preferred football a lot more"" - until deciding to concentrate on a single sport aged 14. Away from the game Chilwell ""tries to do things that take my mind off football"". ""I spend a lot of time watching films and TV series and I love to read,"" he has said. ""I tried to learn the piano and Spanish for a while, but they were both pretty difficult."" He is a big basketball fan and used to have a full-sized court in his garden until he sold his £4.75m, five-bedroom Cobham mansion earlier this year, apparently having become concerned about a rise in burglaries targeting footballers.

As a child, growing up in Summerseat, just outside Bury, Trippier used to play football on the ""one big island of grass"" on his estate. ""You would try to pretend you were the players and I thought I was David Beckham all the time,"" he said. Several years later he seemed to still think he was David Beckham when he curled in a free-kick in the 2018 World Cup semi-final, and his set-piece deliveries have helped him reach double figures for assists this season, for the first time in a decade. He did this despite missing two months of the season with a thigh injury, returning only at the very end - just enough time to prove his match fitness ahead of the Euros. The 33-year-old is one of several high-profile Premier League players (and Stormzy) who are customers of celebrity guard dog providers Chaperone K9, having splashed out £20,000 on a full-trained rottweiler in 2020 - Jamie Vardy, Marcus Rashford, James Maddison and Jack Grealish have also procured protective pooches. Earlier this year one website named him the world's second most famous person called Kieran, after the English actor O'Brien but ahead of Succession star Culkin.

Position: Defender

After loan spells at Huddersfield and Brighton, the centre-back has become a regular at boyhood club Chelsea, helping him earn a first England cap in October's friendly victory over Australia. It was not his first Wembley appearance, having played for Huddersfield in the 2022 Championship final, conceding the own goal which sent Nottingham Forest to the Premier League. Eight years previously he had stepped onto the hallowed turf as a mascot in the FA Vase final, along with his uncles Barry and Byron Mason who went onto win the the trophy for Sholing. ""I walked out when I must've been about 12,"" Colwill said in 2022. ""I was like 'wow, this is it'."" Colwill took up golf two years ago. ""It's just so peaceful, I love it. Going out there and you're on the green and no one else matters,"" he says.

Few could have anticipated Dier would be going to the Euros as he became a fringe player under Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham, where he played four times in the first half of the season before being loaned out to Bayern Munich. The centre-back has enjoyed a renaissance in Germany where he is a regular under Thomas Tuchel, playing in both legs of the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. He has not represented his country since the 2022 World Cup when he came on as a second-half substitute against Senegal. Dier's first experience of the European Championship came aged seven in 2004 when his family moved to Portugal because his mum was offered a job working at the tournament. Dier is still a fan of the dish bife com natas (beef in a cream sauce), which he would enjoy at a restaurant named Maritimo in Alcochete. ""They treated me like family,"" Dier told the Independent.

The big question is not whether Jude Bellingham has the ability to lead England to Euros glory. The 20-year-old has already been the decisive player for the biggest club in the world this season and has worn the expectations, Real Madrid badge, and last summer's €103m transfer from Borussia Dortmund with the ease of the most talented schoolkid on the playground running rings around his mates. The big question remains over where and how Gareth Southgate will deploy Bellingham, who best operates as roaming No 10, with Phil Foden and even Harry Kane likely to drop into similar attacking positions. Bellingham can also operate as a deeper midfielder - his old shirt No 22 before coming to Madrid was because it was the sum of 4+8+10 - but it would be a waste to not play one of the best male players in the world in his best position. Decided both clásicos in his first season in Spain as Real cruised to the league title.

The youngest of four brothers, who have all either spent time at professional academies or in non-league, Gallagher honed his talent and his toughness both on the training ground and in the garden at home. ""We would beat him up so many times, and he would just laugh at us,"" sighed brother Jake. ""He was a madman."" From a family of Chelsea supporters in a home 10 minutes from the Surrey training ground, Gallagher has captained the club this season but has also been repeatedly linked with a £50m move away, although Blues fans recently expressed their support for the midfielder with a tifo at Stamford Bridge emblazoned with 'Chelsea since birth'. International success this summer will only increase the interest in the 24-year-old. ""To us he's our little brother,"" explained brother Josh. ""Mum still runs his bath when he's home.""

""I never pick on reputation - form has to come into it,"" announced Gareth Southgate in his first interview as England manager. Nobody can say that Jordan Henderson is in England's squad on form, but Southgate has obviously bent a few of his own rules to shoehorn the 33-year-old into his side. Henderson has had a torrid time since departing Liverpool last July for Saudi Arabia, his reputation as a defender of LGBTQ+ rights receiving an unrecoverable blow in the process. Football wise it was similarly dismal and he left Al-Ettifaq six months into a three-year, £350,000-a-week contract to join Ajax, where he has played just seven league games since January at the time of writing. The Dutch giants have at least pulled away from the relegation zone in that time, and he has captained the side when fit. Southgate greatly values Henderson's leadership but like his international manager, this feels like the last major tournament with England.

After moving from Leicester to Tottenham last summer Maddison has essentially had three seasons, each with its own completely different character. The first featured 10 and a half league games, three goals, five assists and a string of outstanding performances, and the second also 10 and a half league games, but these were spent on the sidelines with an ankle injury. Since his return he has been much less productive, but it appears that after not giving him a single minute of action between November 2019 and March 2023 Gareth Southgate now trusts him to deliver. The 27-year-old is hoping to make up for the 2022 World Cup, where he struggled with a knee injury and did not get a game: ""I was so disappointed. I'm hungry to get there now,"" he said. Maddison is not a man who takes well to being overshadowed. ""It's not a conscious effort to try and be the showman. That's just how I am as a person. When I go for a roast dinner with my family, I like to be the main man.""

Rice has had a superb first season at Arsenal after a £105m move from West Ham last summer - which made him the most expensive British footballer of all time - continuing a tour of top-flight London clubs having started in Chelsea's youth system, after a cousin who was in their academy helped him get a trial. Rice made three senior international appearances for the Republic of Ireland, all in friendlies, before switching allegiances to England. ""It's fair to say I have spoken with him but I haven't promised anything because I don't think that's right,"" said Gareth Southgate in 2018 as Rice was making up his mind over his future, but it would have been hard for any promise to have been as positive as what has come to pass: Rice made his England debut the following year and his 50th appearance in March, captaining the side against Belgium. He has a huge collection of football shirts and trainers, and is developing a sense of personal style after a youth in which ""mum always told me how to dress"". ""I'm always looking for a pair of trousers that sit above my shoes well,"" he said earlier this year. ""Not too low, not too high. That's a key thing for me, how a pair of trousers sit on shoes.""

In the 2022-23 season Mainoo played just 87 minutes of senior football, with one start and 10 minutes in the league, but since November, when he made his first Premier League start after recovering from a pre-season ankle injury, he has emerged as a key player for Manchester United. He was fast-tracked into the England squad in March and was outstanding in his full debut, a 2-2 draw against Belgium. ""He gives us a different profile of midfield player to anything else we've got,"" Gareth Southgate said. ""His attributes are there for everybody to see, that ability to receive under pressure and ride challenges, to manipulate the ball in tight areas."" He honed those skills while playing as a forward at youth level, before gradually working his way back to central midfield. ""I played a lot as a striker when I was younger, up until I was about 14,"" he said. ""Then I started to play as a 10, I played on the wing a little bit and then I went into midfield."" Mainoo's favourite player is Ronaldinho, even though he was just five when the quicksilver Brazilian last played in Europe.

Watch Eze play for Palace now, and it seems ridiculous that he was once released from West Ham, Arsenal, Fulham and Reading. Trials at Bristol City, Norwich, Swansea and Sunderland and Millwall as a young teenager ultimately came to nothing, before QPR finally gave him a chance. ""I look back on those memories fondly because it's been the shaping of who I am,"" revealed Eze when he received his first England call-up last year. ""He is very, very religious and I think that keeps him grounded in the reality of this crazy world,"" said the QPR coach Paul Hall. Eze is the cousin of Saturday Night Live comedian Ego Nwodim, who was spotted wearing his Palace shirt in a show last year.

The younger half brother of Leon and Carl Cort on his father's side, Loftus-Cheek was always destined to be a footballer but after a string of injuries and false starts at Chelsea, he has been reborn in Italy at Milan, where the 28-year-old has played more than 40 matches for just the third season in his career. Perhaps a natural substitute for Bellingham at this tournament, operating somewhere between a No 8 and No 10, Loftus-Cheek describes himself as ""physical, technical and dominant"". As if those attributes weren't enough, he has also been spotted on the catwalk, previously modelling for Burberry. Not that that played any part in his decision to move to Milan. We think ...

It's fair to say that Bowen has had a busy year. In May 2023, Bowen's partner, Dani Dyer (a reality TV star and daughter of actor Danny Dyer), gave birth to their twin daughters, Summer and Star. Two weeks later, Bowen scored the winning goal in stoppage time of the Conference League final against Fiorentina to earn West Ham their first trophy in 43 years. Signing a bumper new contract in October 2023 until 2030, Bowen scored more than 20 goals this season in all competitions, a fantastic return for someone who often plays on the right. A decade ago, Bowen was playing non-league football for Hereford United. Now, he has a chance to be a European champion.

A third Manchester City and England player born on 28 May. The canteen at the Etihad Campus is always bedecked with bunting and cake on that day. Without Kevin De Bruyne for a number of months Foden was allowed to play more often in his preferred No 10 position for City, repaying the faith with, arguably, his finest season in blue thus far, as he plundered goals and assists. It still remains to be seen, however, how Gareth Southgate fits him into the England team. Keen angler Foden is not the only celebrity in his household, four-year-old son Ronnie boasts 3.9m Instagram followers, but Foden still knows his place, dressing up as his dad for World Book Day. Ronnie and his sister were mascots for the match against Luton but with their dad on the bench, had to do with Julian Álvarez leading them out.

""I'm a boring person, really. I do little hobbies like basketball, snooker and cards but I'm never out drinking,"" Gordon has said. He added chess to that list after picking it up following his move to Newcastle in January 2023: ""I like learning new things so when I was bored I just thought I'd learn,"" he said. ""It's a really intelligent game so I thought I'd test myself."" There are probably others he has yet to publicly identify: one of Gordon's hobbies seems to be collecting hobbies. ""I've got so many and I can't keep still. I get really obsessed with things,"" he said. ""Whatever's on my mind I'll buy all the gear, research into every detail of it. It's just my personality. I think that's a good thing because I don't just settle for just being average at something - I want to be the best at everything I do."" When it comes to football he's giving it a good go, and this season has seen Gordon make massive improvements: he ends it in double figures for both goals and assists, playing mainly off the left wing, leading to a full international debut against Brazil in March.

Having won 10 Bundesliga titles on the trot, nobody expected Bayern to sign Kane and fall short of winning an 11th. Not that the striker is to blame: the 30-year-old could not stop scoring and had 44 goals in 44 games for Bayern at the time of writing. Kane's move to Germany has not been all plain sailing - he didn't move out of a hotel until Christmas and three of his four children were involved in a scary road accident in April - ""they are fine"", Kane reassured reporters - but the family are learning German and seemingly in Bavaria for the long-haul. Now England's record goalscorer, Kane is Southgate's talisman and will be desperate to improve upon the runners-up medal he got at Euro 2020.

Palmer was a childhood Manchester United fan who, after joining City's academy aged eight, ""used to wear a United shirt or some kind of United garment under his sky-blue shirt"", according to his grandfather Sterry Cole (who was born in St Kitts & Nevis before moving to England in 1960, explaining why his grandson has both the English and Kittitian flags on his boots. ""The island is going crazy about Cole,"" said his father, Jermaine. ""They're all Chelsea fans over there now.""). City were set to release him eight years later but Jason Wilcox - recently appointed technical director at Manchester United - insisted they give him a few more years; in fewer than five, and after just three league starts, Chelsea paid £42.5m for him. ""When he arrived,"" Mauricio Pochettino said, ""we were thinking he could be the playmaker we needed. He's the link, he's the playmaker, who makes the team look good."" It turned out Palmer couldn't just make play, he could end it: his debut season at Chelsea has featured more than 20 goals as well as more than 10 assists in all competitions. In April Joe Cole described him as ""an absolute genius"".

Scored 34 goals for club and country in the 2022-23 season but has been badly out of form for Manchester United this campaign, and recently commented on the ""abuse"" he had suffered from fans. ""Enough is enough"", tweeted the 26-year-old in May. Southgate has chosen to keep faith with the versatile forward - only Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling have scored more than him during the manager's tenure - but it seems unlikely he will currently feature in England's starting XI. Rashford's talent is undeniable, but off-field issues have plagued his season - he was disciplined internally by United for reporting ill for training after a night out in Belfast in January. But when Rashford is fit, focused and firing, there are few defenders in world football that can contain him.

Arsenal's star boy and possibly the most popular member of an England squad since Gazza in the 90s, Saka is a right-wing phenomenon on the pitch and impeccably mannered off it. ""He's just that perfect boy which you wish will either be your son or your brother who's just been brought up the right way,"" said Arsenal and England teammate Aaron Ramsdale. ""It's a massive testament to his mum and dad."" Kept the England team entertained at the 2022 World Cup with his TikTok spelling challenge, with Marcus Rashford (given 'embarrassed'), Declan Rice ('pronunciation'), James Maddison ('aesthetic') and Jack Grealish ('rhythm') all failing the test. Will be desperate to go one further in the Euros after missing a penalty in the final shootout against Italy in 2021, after which he, together with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, was racially abused on social media.

Watkins would surely be the starting No 9 for almost any other country at this year's Euros, but the Torquay-born forward is unfortunate to be understudy to Harry Kane with England. Reaching double figures for league goals and assists as early as 3 February this season - the first player to achieve this for Aston Villa in the Premier League since Dwight Yorke in 1995-96 -.Unai Emery has transformed the 28-year-old into a complete striker: he is a threat in behind, drops deep to link play, presses high, is an aerial threat and finishes off both feet. Says he owes his success to Dean Smith (who signed him at Brentford from Exeter, and again at Villa), who once gifted Watkins a fish tank to help him take more responsibility. It backfired. ""I overfed it, and came back from training with the fish floating on top,"" admitted Watkins.

Another England player that made his way in the Football League before shining in the Premier League, Toney is more of a target man than Kane and Watkins and is also valued by England for his penalty-taking ability. After returning from his nine-month betting ban in January, during which Toney admitted he had ""fallen out of love with football"", the striker openly stated his desire to ""play for a top club"", comments that were seen by some as disrespectful to Brentford. Gareth Southgate had no issue though: ""That swagger, that self-belief is crucial. All of the top forward players have it,"" said the England manager. A summer transfer beckons for Toney, but there is work to do in Germany first.

The calves are the main thing that everyone remembers about Grealish but to City he is the player that helps to bring control. A hamstring injury resulted in a missed month at the start of the season, allowing Jérémy Doku to steal his place but Grealish is one of Guardiola's most trusted players and starts when it matters. It takes a lot of energy to gallop up and down City's left flank, with the former Aston Villa man offering defensive discipline in addition to attacking prowess - and Grealish has a refuelling ritual after matches: a Chinese takeaway. His favourite dishes are Singapore chow mein, salt and pepper, prawns chips and wings with curry sauce. He will be desperately hoping Germany can offer the same level of indulgence as his favourite Manchester restaurant Wing's.",turkish-football.com,news,Turkish Football,Emre Sarigul,0.3647058823529412,453373566,19,,

Here are some of the main stories over the last few days of the transfer market from TribalFootball's transfer expert Rudy Galetti...

TUCHEL AND A POSSIBLE FUTURE WITH MAN UTD

Manchester United are in danger of failing to qualify for a UEFA competition next season via the Premier League and all that remains is to hope for an FA Cup victory. If winning the trophy is enough to access the Europa League, it's not so obvious that the Cup will save Erik ten Hag's bench. That's why Man Utd are in contact with other coaches, considered possible replacements for the Dutch manager, especially Thomas Tuchel.

We already talked about him 2 weeks ago and, to date, the current Bayern Munich manager is the preferred profile to lead the squad next season. The German coach has repeatedly expressed his willingness to return to England and, given his farewell to Bayern at the end of the season, considers Man Utd a good opportunity to come back to the Premier with a big club. The choice of the next coach, as usual, will also influence the transfer market of the Red Devils and, among others, the future of Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood could definitely change.

A decision on both has not yet been made precisely because, with the possible farewell of Ten Hag, Jadon and Mason have expressed their interest in remaining at Manchester United without the former Ajax coach, and this could happen under Tuchel.

LUIS ALBERTO, LAST DANCE WITH LAZIO?

Luis Alberto's adventure at Lazio now seems to be nearing its end. The Spanish player, weeks ago, said publicly that he wanted to leave, then Igor Tudor did not call him up for the last match played against Empoli. A situation that seems now unsolvable, which is why Luis Alberto is already looking for a new destination.

Sevilla are interested in him again and could make a concrete move in the coming weeks. Even from Saudi Arabia, they continue to monitor him: the midfielder is now more than a year on their list and was already approached last summer, with a concrete offer set at around €6 million net per season and also Lazio received a €15 million proposal to sell the Spanish player. In the end, the midfielder decided to stay in Italy, also renewing his contract until 2027.

Now, as told, things have changed, with his departure in June very likely. However, Lazio have no intention of lowering the price tag and is willing to let him go only for offers deemed convincing. In any case, his replacement has already been identified: talks with Monza for Andrea Colpani are progressing well.

ARSENAL WORKING TO STRENGTHEN ATTACK

Arsenal are working to make several changes in attack in the summer. Eddie Nketiah has been on the sidelines of the squad for some time: despite a contract expiring in June 2027, the Gunners want to better monetize his probable departure at the end of the season, taking advantage of the interest of many English clubs such as Crystal Palace and Everton, who are monitoring him as a possible replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

Gabriel Jesus' situation is also to be defined, given that at the moment there are no certainties regarding his stay next season: Arsenal are ready to evaluate possible offers for the former Manchester City player. It's clear that with the eventual exit of both Nketiah and Jesus, Arsenal will have to purchase 2 new strikers.

Mikel Arteta is a great admirer of Joshua Zirkzee, who is also highly appreciated in Italy by AC Milan. The current Bologna striker is the Rossoneri's number one target to strengthen the attack given Olivier Giroud's departure for the USA. Arsenal are also working on other names for the attack, and looking for players with different skills than Zirkzee. That's why the Gunners are constantly monitoring Ivan Toney, while Ollie Watkins appears a complicated option. Benjamin Sesko is also in their sights, but - given the ""just"" 50 million euro release clause - many other top European clubs are also in the race.

ALEX SANDRO, MANY ADMIRERS AND A FUTURE YET TO BE DECIDED

Alex Sandro is ready to leave Juventus as a free agent in the summer, confirmed. Negotiations for his renewal never began and, as reported in November, the Bianconeri had already informed the Brazilian player that these would be the last months he would spend in Turin.

Alex Sandro, in recent weeks, has been approached by the Saudi League to explore the room of negotiation of a possible transfer there. In particular, one of the Saudi clubs most interested in Alex is Al Hilal: open to evaluating suitable offers for Renan Lodi in the same role, Al Hilal consider Sandro a suitable replacement if Lodi leaves. The Juventus player appreciated the attempt from Saudi and doesn't close the door to having an experience there, but at the moment - after 9 years spent in Italy - he prefers to remain in Europe.

Here, some teams are interested and, in the last days, Porto contacted the left-back: talks with the Portuguese team are going positively and some developments are expected soon. Also in Brazil, some clubs showed interest in him: Sao Paulo, above all, contacted him at the beginning of May, confirming they will to make an offer soon. So the competition for Alex Sandro is fierce: his future will be defined in the coming weeks.

ARNE SLOT AND HIS FIRST REQUESTS TO LIVERPOOL

Arne Slot has already made some requests to Liverpool management for the next summer transfer window. The absolute priority is for a new centre-back, preferably left-footed, also in light of the too many errors in defence throughout the season.

Several names are on Liverpool's list, including Gonçalo Inacio, who has been followed for a long time and will most likely leave Sporting CP at the end of the season. Some clubs in Europe are interested in him, also because the 60 million euro release clause in his contract is considered a fair amount. In addition to the Portuguese player, Willian Pacho of Eintracht Frankfurt - whose contract with the Germans expires in 2028 - is also on the list.

Another topic that will involve Liverpool, and Arne Slot, in the coming weeks is linked to Mohamed Salah. Al Ittihad are ready for a new attempt with a monstreoffer that could allow the Reds to self-finance most of their incoming moves. Anyway, although nothing has been decided yet, Liverpool are already monitoring some possible replacements, such as Leroy Sane - whose contract with Bayern Munich expires in 2025 - Johan Bakayoko (PSV) and Estevao (Palmeiras), who is in advanced talks with Chelsea.",tribalfootball.com,news,tribalfootball.com,Rudy Galetti,0.1294117647058823,453371097,19,https://images.tribalfootball.com/default/0001/12/3b828ce20c2ceef181b33f1128f14f015aa9874e.jpeg,

There are, however, themes recognisable down the decades: managerial disruption; key player departures and injuries; cup distractions; rising rivals.

A reason City look destined to become the first to win four consecutive titles is that only the last of these applies to them, in the shape of Arsenal. City are in the FA Cup final against Manchester United, but that is hardly keeping Pep Guardiola awake at night. Those four historic factors are also offset by City's modern strengths -- limitless wealth, Guardiola and experience.

Any discussion of the greatest figures in English football often begins with Herbert Chapman. A Yorkshireman born in 1878, Chapman may appear unfeasibly distant but he is regarded as the first modern manager, a man who shaped the game forever.

Chapman's arrival at Huddersfield Town in 1921 initiated a revolution at a club who, at that stage, had never won a trophy.

They were improving, though. In 1920, they were promoted to England's top tier, the old First Division. They also reached a first FA Cup final, losing to Aston Villa. It shows Chapman had talent to work with.

But he made at least two stellar signings: Clem Stephenson, 30, an established captain from Villa, and George Brown, a teenager plucked from a Northumberland coal mine. In 1922, Huddersfield won the FA Cup and in the 1923-24 season, they were champions of England.

It was by the narrowest of margins - goal average, the division of the number scored by the total conceded, which predated goal difference. The last goal of the season, scored by Brown, effectively took Huddersfield ahead of Cardiff City. For a provincial side, this was enormous. Arsenal, for example, had not yet been champions and City would not be until 1937.

That Chapman organised a Town repeat in 1924-25 was even more impressive. Huddersfield conceded a mere 28 goals in 42 games and Chapman was christened the 'Napoleon of football'.

Then Arsenal signed Napoleon and Huddersfield had to react.

As with VARs today, times were changing. Arsenal corner-kick enthusiasts of 2024 will note that in 1924 players were now allowed to score directly from a corner. The first to do so was a Chapman player, Billy Smith. And in 1925-26 a more seismic change was introduced: the offside law now decreed that instead of needing three opponents (usually including a goalkeeper) to be between an attacking player and the goal, now it was two. The aim was to stimulate higher scoring.

It worked. Huddersfield still had the best defence in the country, but they conceded 60 goals. And they had their third consecutive title, despite the loss of Chapman.

Former Derby County manager Cecil Potter had succeeded Chapman, ""against his own inclinations,"" reported the Derby Telegraph newspaper. Potter coped with the upheaval but as he and the players prepared for a unique four-in-a-row, suddenly Potter was gone. It was ""on account of ill health"", apparently. In came Jack Chaplin, a Scot and former Manchester City full-back. He had joined Huddersfield as a trainer under Chapman.

According to the Athletic News, Chaplin ""has gained a real reputation as the man who has kept the Town players fit through three championship campaigns"", but by the third Saturday of the 2026-27 season, when beaten 2-0 at home, one headline read: ""Not like the real Huddersfield.""

And so it proved. Newcastle United were champions in 1926-27, with Town second having drawn 17 games. They were fractionally less effective, which may ring a bell with Gary Neville about United in 2001-02.

Any perception United slackened off in the seasons after winning the historic 1999 treble is misplaced. In 1999-2000, they won a second consecutive title, by 18 points from Arsenal, and in 2000-01 it was by 10 points.

But at the end of that third Premier League triumph in 2001, Sir Alex Ferguson announced he would be retiring the following year. Neville said once Ferguson had shared his news ""its unsettling effect was indisputable"". Ferguson later said, ""There wasn't the same performance level on the pitch."" United dipped a little, three points worse than the previous season, but finished third.

Liverpool in 1984-85 turned out to be Joe Fagan's second and last season. Given they finished second, reached the European Cup final and the semi-final of the FA Cup, it would be a stretch to call the season a failure. But as Fagan said: ""By Liverpool's standards I realise we have been a bit disappointing."" He was 64, but managerial uncertainty did not hang over the season and did not cause the slip.

In January 1934, Arsenal had to deal with the shocking sudden death of Chapman in mid-season. The 55-year-old was repeating his brilliance from Huddersfield, having led Arsenal to the title in 1930-31 and again in 1932-33. They were four points clear of Derby in the 1933-34 campaign when, on the morning of January 6, Chapman died of pneumonia.

Arsenal placed secretary George Allison in charge and the players won the league by three points. Arsenal won a third consecutive title in 1934-35, scoring 115 goals, 25 more than second-placed Sunderland. Tom Whittaker, the Chapman-appointed Arsenal coach, attributed this to all being ""steeped in the knowledge"" of their former leader. There was continuity even without Chapman.

Arsenal began the defence of their third title with a 3-1 win against Sunderland in front of 66,000 at Highbury. Ted Drake scored twice that day and, in mid-December, got all seven goals in a 7-1 defeat of Villa.

Arsenal looked set, sitting fourth in the table, averaging about 2.5 goals a game. But they lost to Liverpool on Boxing Day, then in February Drake was injured and missed two months. Plus, the FA Cup started and Arsenal wanted to win it. They ultimately finished sixth.

""It was obvious we were going to have a Herculean task in defending the 'property' we had won over three years,"" Whittaker said.

Bob Paisley bowed out at Liverpool with league titles in 1981-82 and 1982-83 (by 11 points). In 1983-84, Fagan added another, as well as the European Cup and League Cup.

Even for such a brilliant team, beating that in 1984-85 was always going to take some doing. When the next season began, Liverpool won only two of their first 11 league games culminating in a 1-0 home defeat by Everton, their rivals' first at Anfield in 14 years, courtesy of Graeme Sharp's spectacular goal. Liverpool were 17th, their worst league position since 1970.

The explanation was on the pitch. Graeme Souness, the club's greatest midfielder, had moved to Italy. The hole he left was always going to be impossible to fill, even though Liverpool bought excellent midfielders in John Wark and Jan Molby. ""We definitely missed Graeme,"" Kenny Dalglish said.

And for the first time since his arrival in 1977, the equally great Dalglish, now 33, was in single figures for goals. It sounds simplistic, but these are reasons why there was no fourth consecutive title. As Ferguson said: ""The Souness-Dalglish Liverpool teams were the benchmark for English football.""

Just as Arsenal missed Drake, Liverpool missed Ian Rush. In 1983-84, Rush scored 47 goals in all competitions, 32 of them in the league. He and Dalglish were like Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. In 1984-85, hit by injuries, Rush got 14 goals in 28 league appearances.

Ferguson understood the cost of losing keystone players. After he had announced his intention to retire he produced another shock, selling Jaap Stam to Lazio. United's defence was wrong-footed. In 2000-01, they conceded 0.8 goals per Premier League game; in 2001-02 it was 1.2.

Ruud van Nistelrooy came from PSV Eindhoven in the summer of 2001 and scored 23 goals in 32 Premier League appearances, but the signings of Juan Sebastian Veron and Diego Forlan were less convincing. Ferguson was vehement in his defence of Veron at the time; in his 2016 book Leading, he wrote Veron was one of those players ""immune to discipline -- try as I might, I could not get him to fit into our system"".

Eight years later, in the 2009-10 season, Ferguson had to deal with a Souness-like departure when Cristiano Ronaldo left for Real Madrid. With Carlos Tevez also gone, Ferguson worried about ""our strike force (being) a little gap-toothed for a while"".

Ronaldo's goal tallies in his previous three Premier League seasons were 17, 31 and 18. His absence was felt in 2009-10, yet with Wayne Rooney getting 26 goals, United actually scored 86 -- more than in the three previous seasons when they had been champions. There was another major factor -- Chelsea, who beat them to the title by a point.

City have dealt with some injuries this season -- De Bruyne, John Stones -- but the squad is resilient and deep. They have lost players in the transfer market too -- Riyad Mahrez, Aymeric Laporte and Cole Palmer among others. But Guardiola's core team has not been weakened. Mateo Kovacic, Josko Gvardiol and Jeremy Doku have all been fitted in seamlessly.

Ferguson's regret was that he and United did not win more Champions Leagues. ""I always said Manchester United ought to be achieving more in Europe,"" he said.

With Neville later admitting he was ""bored"" by United's domestic domination, the Champions League became their focus. In April 2010, United were 4-2 ahead on aggregate against Bayern Munich at Old Trafford in the quarter-finals. Another semi-final looked on. Then Rafael was sent off, Arjen Robben scored an aggregate equaliser and United went out on away goals.

The European hangover contributed, three days later, to a 0-0 draw at Blackburn. A win would have put United top of the Premier League. ""It makes it really difficult to win the league now,"" Ferguson said.

In 2001-02, the added European distraction for Ferguson was the final being staged in his home city of Glasgow -- ""The urge to lead the team out at Hampden Park obsessed me.""

But United lost on the away goals rule to Bayer Leverkusen in the semi-final and, as in 2010, they did not win their next Premier League game after that exit. It again told.

The Arsenal team of 1936 could sympathise. They had their own knockout distraction, the FA Cup, a competition held in such esteem that, after winning three league titles, reaching the final at Wembley was the priority of Arsenal's season. (It also meant player bonuses at a time of the maximum wage.)

In the third round at Bristol Rovers, with Arsenal 1-0 down, Whittaker locked Allison out of the dressing room at half-time. ""I ripped into the lads... then before I unlocked the door to send them out again past the anxious Allison, I told (Cliff) Bastin and (Bobby) Davidson to switch places. Arsenal clicked from the restart.""

Arsenal won 5-1. When they reached the semi-final, these champions of the three previous seasons won only two of their remaining 11 league games. The FA Cup mattered far more than four-in-a-row and they duly defeated Sheffield United at Wembley.

In 2024, for City and Arsenal, it is fair to say the status of the Premier League and FA Cup has been reversed.

Sunderland were the team who took Arsenal's potential fourth title. After losing at Highbury on the opening day of the 1935-36 season, Sunderland won 21 of their next 29 matches. By late February, they were 16 points ahead of Arsenal.

Sunderland had finished sixth in 1934, second in 1935 and were champions for the sixth (and, to date, last) time in 1936. Club legends Raich Carter, Bobby Gurney and Patsy Gallacher scored 81 goals between them, and the team beat Arsenal 5-4 at Roker Park.

It was a similar story for Huddersfield in 1927. Newcastle had Hughie Gallacher in his first full season at St James' Park and Gallacher scored 36 goals in 38 league games. Crucially one of these was a winner against Huddersfield over Easter in 1927. Newcastle were top, Town third. The papers called it a ""staggering blow"". It was Newcastle's fourth (and, to date, last) title. They were an established power.

In the mid-1980s Liverpool were faced with another growing force, a major club enjoying a renewal -- Everton. Manager Howard Kendall built an electric team at Goodison Park and in 1984-85, they won the title by 13 points. Goalkeeper Neville Southall was the writers' Footballer of the Year and midfielder Peter Reid was Players' Player of the Year. Everton finished second the next season and were champions again in 1986-87 (by nine points). Liverpool were second on both occasions and champions either side. Theirs were marginal losses and gains.

In 2010, it was Chelsea foiling United's possible four-timer. Fuelled by Roman Abramovich's Russian economics, Chelsea won three Premier Leagues in six seasons. Managed by Carlo Ancelotti, they scored 103 league goals (Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard getting 51 of them), and ran up a goal difference of 71.

They also had a great goalkeeper, Petr Cech, of whom Ferguson said ruefully: ""I should have signed him at 19 when I had my chance.""

With six games to go, Chelsea went to Old Trafford, with United top by a point, and won 2-1. Finishing second by a point, United's season was hardly terrible. They simply encountered a flowing team.

Manchester City's 2023-24 edition have met an Arsenal team who finished fifth in May 2022 on 69 points, second in May 2023 on 84 points and who have 86 after Sunday's win at Old Trafford.

City can reach 91 points. There is a sliver of jeopardy about their trip to Tottenham on Tuesday, but if City do drop points and miss out on four-in-a-row it will not be because of managerial disruption, key player departures or cup distractions. It will be because of Arsenal.

But as the headlines will say, it feels like the fourth is with City. Saturday's starting XI at Fulham had 31 Premier League titles between them and when the first substitute came on, Kyle Walker added another five. It is an avalanche of quality and experience that will surely make English history.

So when U.S. men's national team right back Sergiño Dest confirmed earlier this month that he'll miss the 2024 Copa América with a torn ACL, it opened the door for USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter to name a defender he might not have otherwise included on the 23-man American squad for the high-profile tournament on home soil.

Sure, Berhalter could simply deploy experienced and versatile winger Tim Weah in Dest's fullback spot; Weah has played the position much of this season, his first with Italian titan Juventus. Yet Berhalter could still opt to take an extra right-sided defender besides Joe Scally, just in case. Somebody could get an opportunity. Someone like Bryan Reynolds.

The former Roma and FC Dallas prospect has just seven U.S. caps since his 2021 debut. But the 22-year-old has been quietly excellent for Belgian club Westerlo this season. Age-eligible for this summer's Olympics, Reynolds was probably Paris-bound before Dest went down. But if he's climbed past 2022 World Cup veterans Shaq Moore or DeAndre Yedlin on Berhalter's depth chart, Reynolds could be summoned to the Copa América instead. That's how quickly things can change.

While Reynolds' stock is rising, he isn't alone. With the long European and Mexican seasons winding down, MLS heating up and the Americans scheduled to report for pre-Copa América training camp beginning May 28, here's how the rest of the player pool is faring for their clubs.

Although Ethan Horvath played the final 16 games for Cardiff City in England's second division, Matt Turner remains the likely U.S. No. 1 this summer despite being nailed to Nottingham Forest's bench for most of 2024. Remember: Berhalter went with a similarly idle Turner at the last World Cup, when Horvath was starting for Luton Town. Miami's Drake Callender should continue to fill the third slot over veteran Zack Steffen while youngsters Gaga Slonina and Patrick Schulte vie for the starting job at the Paris Games. Expect one or both of the Olympians to graduate to the senior squad this fall.

As if to remind Berhalter of both his pedigree and his ability to man either side of the field, Scally had his best game of the season on Saturday. In his 89th career Bundesliga game for Borussia Monchengladbach, Scally switched from right to left back and delivered an assist in a 1-1 draw versus Eintracht Frankfurt. It was his fourth helper of 2023-24.

Left back lock Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson's career season for Fulham continues despite Saturday's 4-0 loss to mighty Manchester City. Fulham closes its season at Luton on Sunday. Kristoffer Lund, Jedi's understudy since last September, has 31 starts for Palermo in Italy's Serie B.

Those three are likely to make Berhalter's roster. The boss will get a last look at Reynolds this weekend, when Westerlo hosts Mechelen in the Belgian Pro League playoffs.

Chris Richards is a set-in-stone starter at this point; he's been superb defensively for Premier League Crystal Palace. Tim Ream and Miles Robinson have rotated in and out of Berhalter's lineup since the fall. The latter could have the inside track, as Ream hasn't logged a minute for Fulham since February. Walker Zimmermann is finally healthy again, but the 30-year-old will be considered for one of the three available Olympic roster spots reserved for players older than 23. If Zimmerman commits, Cameron Carter-Vickers or Mark McKenzie will compete for the final Copa América center back spot -- unless McKenzie is tapped for Olympic duty, too.

Tyler Adams is back. On Saturday, the Americans' World Cup captain made his first appearance for Bournemouth since March. That's great news for the USMNT, though fans will surely be holding their breath when the Cherries complete their Prem slate on Sunday at Chelsea.

Weston McKennie had a rare bad game for Juve on Sunday, with manager Max Allegri pulling the Texan at halftime of a 1-1 tie with Salernitana. McKennie remains an in-pen selection for Berhalter. The same can't still be said for Yunus Musah, though it helps that the 21-year-old won back his starting job with AC Milan in recent weeks. So too should the fact that Gio Reyna didn't participate in either of Forest's last two matches.

Adams, McKennie, Reyna and Musah will all be on Berhalter's 23 if healthy. That leaves just two backup central midfield spots. One will surely go to Johnny Cardoso, who on Sunday made his 15th start in Real Betis's last 17 La Liga games. Celta Vigo's Luca de la Torre will probably take the other place, though he lost his starting job with Celta after the injury that forced him to withdraw from the USMNT's Nations League roster in March. German-based destroyer Lennard Maloney is also in the mix. Maloney returned from a shoulder injury Saturday in Heidenheim's 1-1 tie with Freiburg, his 26th Bundesliga start of the campaign.

With a brace for AC Milan on Saturday, Christian Pulisic increased his career best goal haul to 15 across all competitions. He's in the form of his life heading into Copa América. The Rossoneri has two Serie A games to go, starting with Saturday's trip to Torino.

Weah is the incumbent on the right for the U.S.; he'd also started three consecutive matches for Juve before missing Sunday's draw because of yellow card accumulation. After a stint in a central playmaking role, Brenden Aaronson has returned to a wider position with Union Berlin. With competition more forgiving there than in the middle, this should help the 23-year-old survive Berhalter's cut. Malik Tillman is soaring after helping PSV Eindhoven win the Dutch title. Still just 21, Tillman has nine goals and 15 assists in 39 total appearances for PSV, which last week exercised its option to buy the German-American from Bayern Munich.

Alex Zendejas is a dark horse pick. With 14 goals for Mexican power Club América in 2023-24.

Kevin Paredes also has an outside shot now that he's starting again in the Bundesliga, though the 21-year-old is probably earmarked for the Olympics if Wolfsburg OKs his release.

The math just won't math for Berhalter, who has five deserving forwards (Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi Josh Sargent, Brandon Vazquez and Haji Wright) but just three available Copa roster slots, tops. What will the coach do?

With 16 goals in just 27 English Championship games, Sargent is a shoo-in. Wright's Nations League heroics (combined with his ability to play the left wing) has earned him a recall.

One could argue that Balogun (7 goals in 28 games for Monaco in France's Ligue 1) ought to be the odd man out. But Pepi made just two starts for PSV all season. With the 21-year-old age-eligible for the Olympics and U.S. under 23-head coach Marko Mitrović desperate to add a proven goalscorer -- Pepi is that even if his most recent strike was on March 17 -- before heading to France, that assignment could make the most sense. Pepi subbed on for the final 21 minutes of Sunday's 1-1 tie with Fortuna Sittard.

Despite 10 goals in just 1,351 minutes for Liga MX side Monterrey, Vazquez's odds of beating out any of the European-based forwards for a Copa spot are slim. That said, Mitrović would be lucky to have the 26-year-old target man as an Olympic over-ager.",foxsports.com,news,FOX Sports,,0.192156862745098,453338306,19,https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1408/814/2024-05-13_usmnt-stock-watch_16x9.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,

Each week, we bring you updates on how American players in leagues around Europe fared over the weekend.

What should his central defensive partnership look like? How can he replace the injured Sergino Dest at full-back? Which of his in-form midfielders gets the nod to start?

But there is one thing of which he can be absolutely sure: the USMNT head coach will have the galvanising benefit of his best player arriving at the tournament off the back of the best form of his career to date.

Christian Pulisic's brace for AC Milan on Saturday took his goal tally for the campaign so far to 12, making him the first Rossoneri midfielder to score more than 10 goals, excluding penalties, in a single season since Kaka in 2005-06 (11).

His man-of-the-match performance in the 5-1 win over Cagliari, a victory that almost ensures Milan will finish runners-up to rivals Inter Milan, was a delight for Americans seeking evidence that their team can seriously compete against the South American big guns at the tournament.

Featuring on both sides of the attack, Pulisic scored with both feet and proved a constant menace for the Sardinian side.

He has 26 goal contributions across all competitions for his club with two games remaining, an even more impressive feat given it is his first season in Italy since last summer's move from Chelsea in a deal worth up to €22million ($24.2m; £18.8m).

Pulisic's rapid adaptation and consistently good form have even surprised Milan boss Stefano Pioli, the man who pushed to sign him.

""In my opinion, Pulisic is a phenomenal player because he has quality in his choices, an intensity throughout the match which is exceptional,"" he told DAZN.

""When I met him this summer on Zoom, I had very positive perceptions, but then working together was even better than I thought: for the quality of the player, the quality of the person and the professional that he is.""

Next up for Pulisic are games against Torino and Salernitana before he reports for international duty ahead of the Copa America, which begins on June 20.

Player of the weekend

Cameron Carter-Vickers is tantalisingly close to picking up his third Scottish title winner's medal after helping Celtic to a decisive Old Firm derby win.

Brendan Rodgers' team edged out 10-man Rangers 2-1 at Parkhead on Saturday to move six points clear at the top of the table, meaning they need just one point from games against Kilmarnock and St Mirren to secure the title again.

Carter-Vickers played a significant role in the pivotal victory, with the 26-year-old making six clearances, winning seven duels (according to FotMob) and helping create Matt O'Riley's opening goal for the hosts with an arrowed long ball to Callum McGregor, who then teed up the midfielder.

With Chris Richards also in impressive form at Crystal Palace, who again performed well on Saturday as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1 at Molineux, the pair offer Berhalter an interesting alternative partnership for the summer.

Graphic of the week

For years, Johnny Cardoso felt as much a mythical prospect than a real midfielder. Few young Americans spend their developmental years in Brazil, a league that's not terribly well-followed Stateside and, for many years, was hard to watch at all. That, coupled with a lack of consistent involvement under Berhalter, left Johnny as a relative outsider when projecting USMNT rosters.

Of course, clubs in Europe were watching and, after a few sharp seasons with Internacional, Real Betis pried him away last winter with a five-year contract on offer. Given the 22-year-old's strong first impression, it seems unlikely that he'll be around to play out that pact in its entirety.

In a side with distinguished veterans of Europe's top leagues like Isco, Nabil Fekir and Hector Bellerin, Johnny has swiftly made himself a regular starter.

Manuel Pellegrini's side prefers a short-passing game throughout much of their build-up, with La Liga's sixth-shortest average distance of 17.3 meters per pass. In Brazil, Johnny's deep-lying distribution drew eyes, but as Betis' defensive midfielder, he's had plenty of time to refine his re-circulatory craft.

It's easy to see why some of Europe's top clubs are already kicking themselves for not signing him sooner. Johnny's seamless transition also bodes well for his potential role at the Copa. As Tyler Adams has continued to fight leg muscle injuries in the season's final weeks, Johnny may be equipped to not just make the squad, but become the USMNT's starting No 6 at the tournament.

If so, his role with Betis would help Berhalter's side retain possession -- though he may need to rediscover some of those line-breaking balls to help the team advance upfield given Sergino Dest's absence.

""Surgery went well! Thank GOD! Now it's time to look forward.""

Dest kept fans updated after surgery on his damaged cruciate ligament. He revealed on Instagram that the procedure had been a success, next to a picture of him leaving hospital in a wheelchair.

Dest will be a big miss for the USMNT this summer and his injury has also cast uncertainty over his club future, with Dutch champions PSV hoping to negotiate a new deal with Barcelona to sign him permanently this summer.

The 23-year-old has had limited game time for Como in Italy's second tier since joining in January, with one start and eight introductions from the bench. But he will be extra incentivised to build on that next term after Como sealed promotion to Serie A at the weekend with a 1-1 draw against Cosenza.

Gioacchini, who joined on a three-and-a-half-year deal from St Louis City, has eight caps for the national team.

The following day, Paxten Aaronson's Vitesse take on Ajax (8.30am), while Tyler Adams is fit again and could play for Bournemouth against Chelsea on the Premier League's final day (11am, Peacock Premium).",nytimes.com,news,The New York Times,,0.1215686274509804,453323973,10,https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/13112423/0513_USMNTPlayerTracker.jpg,

In Sergino Dest, Malik Tillman and Ricardo Pepi, PSV have three bright young talents who have also captured the imagination of USMNT fans in a year when the Copa America will take place on home soil, a warm-up of sorts before the 2026 World Cup being co-hosted with Canada and Mexico.

The Athletic visited the Netherlands in February to speak to them...

It's carnival time in Eindhoven; everyone dons fancy dress -- from dinosaurs to hippies to fairies and even the odd PSV kit -- and then gathers together.

The city's football team has won again and there is an understandably upbeat atmosphere around their impressive training ground on its rural outskirts.

At 23 years old, Dest is the elder statesman of the club's USMNT contingent (Tillman and Pepi are both 21). The defender is enjoying being a mainstay of the team following two difficult seasons at his Spanish parent club Barcelona -- who he joined for €21million ($22.5m) from Amsterdam's Ajax in October 2020 -- and then Italy's AC Milan on loan.

His contract at Camp Nou runs until 2025, but last summer he was offered the chance to return to the Netherlands. PSV would like to sign him permanently, too, but will try to negotiate a new deal with the Catalans after the knee injury which could rule him out for up to nine months.

He has said he would be open to staying and, for Dest, a large part of his comfort in Eindhoven is based around something he has perhaps lacked in recent years: honesty.

It is a theme he keeps returning to in conversation.

""That's what makes this club so special; you can have normal conversations with people and they're upfront, even if sometimes you don't like to hear some things,"" Dest says. ""They respect you and treat you well and, for me, that's very important. If people respect you, you will feel better and play better. The same goes the other way round.

""The coach (Peter Bosz) is usually very calm with us and he's confident in us. Even if we have a game where we don't play as well as we can, he still believes in us. We have a lot of quality and we are always able to turn things around. That's important.""

PSV would ultimately become champions in May, but Dest explained the relentless ethic that meant nobody at the club let themselves believe the title was already in the bag.

""We can't enjoy it fully yet,"" says Dest. ""We have to concentrate. We're confident we're going to be champions but... there is still a lot that can change. We want to break records and if you want to do that you have to stay focused.""

The challenge for Bosz is to keep his players' eyes on the prize, while also ensuring young talents such as Tillman and Pepi can flourish despite not being starting regulars. Up front, club icon Luuk de Jong has retired from international duty to dedicate himself to his domestic dreams in his second spell at PSV. In midfield, various talents jostle to play behind him.

Dest is a strong personality -- not one to follow the herd. He is unsure if he would ever want the job of leading a club from the technical area, though.

""I don't think I'll ever want to be a coach,"" he says. ""Maybe I would like to be one of the assistants. Perhaps the technical skills coach or whatever. I'd maybe consider that one day, but as for head coach? No, I don't think so. I like to be a little bit in the background, not talking all the time and explaining myself.""

In 2022, Dest's father Kenneth explained to The Athletic how not being front and centre is nothing new for his son.

""They (his schoolteachers) always noticed that whenever the students had to do things together, he always was outside the circle a bit, observing the people, not really in the middle of it,"" said Kenneth Dest. ""That was his nature, seeing what type of individuals they were; not always jumping in, a bit quiet.""

Dest was also attracted when this potential move to the Philips Stadium came up by the presence at the club of Earnie Stewart as technical director. The 55-year-old was formerly sporting director at the United States Soccer Federation, where he played a part in nurturing Dest's progress to the senior team; and like the defender, he was born here in the Netherlands and played for USMNT.

""We have always had a really nice and honest connection,"" says Dest of Stewart. ""I don't see him every day but he's always there for me. I feel comfortable around him. But I'm also not that person that, if I know someone, I'll take advantage. Again, I like to be in the background and just observe.

""I can rely on myself. Even if the coach was my dad, I wouldn't do it.""

Dest may be of the media-schooled generation, but he is comfortable speaking his mind.

Take this summer's Copa America. He knows the easy soundbite would be to say he is thrilled for the competition -- effectively the South American federation's championship, like the Euros or Africa Cup of Nations, but with some invited guest nations involved, too -- to take place on home soil and that the USMNT can go all the way. Likewise at the World Cup in 2026.

""We are a young team and when we went to the 2022 World Cup we were on an upward curve but we also had some setbacks,"" explains Dest, who started all four of his country's games in Qatar and assisted Christian Pulisic's goal in the 1-0 win over Iran, but will miss the Copa after tearing his ACL.

""The line isn't always rising though, it can go down. We need to get back to our shape now, get back together. At this moment I think if we were to play the World Cup tomorrow, we would not be ready.""

Will this summer, then, provide a better indication of the USMNT's ability to challenge for major honours?

""Yes. The Copa can have a great effect and we will also see where we stand, but even that is (four) months from now,"" Dest says. ""In that time, a lot can still happen.

""The warm-up game against Colombia (in June, two weeks before the tournament) will be amazing. A great opponent we can test ourselves against.

""I would love to have had it (Copa America) in South America. The future is the most important in my opinion, over money and everything, so I'm kind of disappointed in some ways that it's not in one of those nations. That's where it started and where it should be.

""It's like you're playing the Euros in Africa. It doesn't make sense to me. But nowadays everything is about the money. I'd love to have seen it in Brazil or Colombia and seen that passion for football. It should be a culture thing; for the fans it is, but for others it's business, unfortunately.""

Despite his troubles, Dest remains in love with football; which is why being ostracised at Milan hurt. It may also have deepened his determination to succeed, something he must rely on again as he begins months of gruelling rehabilitation on his knee.

""I was doing double sessions, extra work on the training ground and then I had personal trainers outside,"" he explains. ""I was working on my passes, fitness and strength. I had the time to do it and do it without factoring in getting sore after games and that recovery.

""It was even looking at my diet. Obviously, if you don't play that much, you still burn a lot (of energy) in training but I cut down my carbs. I didn't feel the need for them to be as high. After a couple of days it was hard, but I got used to it.""

If Dest is one of PSV's main men, sitting in the canteen at De Herdgang, the club's training ground, are two of the club's young contenders.

Tillman and Pepi are fresh from a post-training strength and conditioning session in the gym, and ready to unwind after a busy 24 hours. The previous evening, they made their usual impact from the bench as PSV swept aside Volendam. Pepi had only been on the field for two minutes when he confidently scored their fourth goal, and Tillman created two chances during his 18-minute cameo.

They are two of the USMNT's most exciting young talents, and featuring in this all-conquering club side is providing them a platform to show their ability -- even if a little patience is required.

Tillman and Pepi both arrived at PSV last summer. Striker Pepi, formerly of FC Dallas in MLS, arrived in a €9million ($9.8m) July deal from German top-flight club Augsburg; Tillman joined on loan from Bayern Munich the following month, after spending the previous season on loan at Glasgow side Rangers in Scotland.

El Paso, Texas-born Pepi would probably walk into most other teams in the Eredivisie, but at PSV he faces the task of getting into the game ahead of De Jong.

Tillman must edge out either experienced central midfielder Jerdy Schouten or explosive Belgium international winger Johan Bakayoko. Such is the way at a team competing for glory on multiple fronts.

But as Pepi sips a coffee across from his friend, it seems neither is letting the lack of starts weigh too heavily on them.

""He hasn't been sitting on the bench as much as I have but when we do, we normally sit next to each other,"" says Pepi. ""We're usually watching the game and talking about stuff. We have a good relationship.

""I knew something about him before I came, but we didn't have this special connection then.""

Tillman, who was born in the German city of Nuremberg to a German mother and American father, understands enough Dutch to be the pair's main translator, while Pepi picked some up last season during a spell on loan at Groningen, another Eredivisie team.

The duo featured in PSV's Champions League campaign too, with Pepi scoring the header that secured a 3-2 away win against Spain's Sevilla in November, and with it progress into the knockout stage.

""I was pleased for him because normally this guy can't head a ball, man,"" laughs Tillman, who joined the club permanently on May 10.

Pepi pretends to be offended, before they both laugh.

""It was a dream come true,"" he says. ""I remember leaving school to watch these games (in the Champions League, which kick off during weekday afternoons in the States because of the time difference to Europe) as a kid, so to actually score in one was indescribable. It was more about scoring in such an important game that we had to win.

""I've watched it back. It's a thing where, in the moment, you don't really focus on it because you've got so much adrenaline, but it hits later.""

Pepi, though, is no stranger to performing when it matters.

On his USMNT senior debut in September 2021, he scored and provided an assist to help beat Honduras 4-1 and lift the side's World Cup qualification hopes.

His knack for getting on target when it counts has produced rave reviews since his days in MLS and explains his Spanish-language nickname, 'El tren'. ""When I broke through at Dallas I scored a few goals and people started talking about a hype train,"" he explains. ""So in Spanish it was, 'El tren'.""

Tillman has also been talked up a lot since joining Bayern in 2015 along with his brother Timothy (who now plays for LAFC in MLS).

Last season, he scored 10 goals (with four assists) for Rangers and experienced a whole new level of intensity via their Old Firm derby games.

""Wow,"" he says reflecting on those games against fellow Glasgow side Celtic. ""A lot of tension. Unfortunately, we didn't win any of them while I was there, but it was a good experience.

""After the first game against Celtic, I remember we weren't allowed any away fans any more in the stadium, so it was just the whole stadium against you. If you score, nobody is going to cheer. It was crazy... completely different.

""Here, we have a big rivalry with Feyenoord (the previous champions, from Rotterdam). In Glasgow, it's more the stuff around other things like religion when the fans fight and go a bit crazy.""

Pepi picks up the theme. ""When it comes to Feyenoord here, you can feel that every duel you make on the pitch is way more intense,"" he says. ""It's kind of fierce.""

Both players stand at over 6ft (183cm). Tillman is quieter but quick to smile, with Pepi more confident in conversation.

Both are likeable and club staff speak of them in high regard, as does manager Bosz -- even if he chose a dose of tough love for Tillman in September when he was dropped from the squad for an away game after missing a morning meeting before the team made the 80-minute drive north to face Almere City.

""I overslept,"" he says, still bashful at the memory. ""I didn't make it to the training ground and when I knew I wouldn't get there in time I called the team manager and told him. At first, he said OK come straight to the hotel but then he called again and said he's spoken to the coach (Bosz) and I should stay home. So, yeah, I stayed home. I apologised to the team and afterwards I showed I have learned from it.

""It's the worst feeling,"" he says, as we expand on the topic of being late when you're in elite sport.

""I guess I can laugh about it now. Or the team can,"" adds Tillman. ""The worst was coming in the next day and everyone knew what happened and they're going to look at you. It's part of it.""

Both understood why Bosz responded how he did. ""We're winning every weekend and want to be champions so we have got to keep each other on our toes,"" says Pepi.

They each have title winners' medals now, and Tillman's season had an extra positive outcome when he signed his four-year contract to remain a PSV player with Bosz's endorsement. ""He is only 21 years old, but has already taken so many steps in his development this year,"" said the manager. ""That is nice to see and I am curious to see how he will continue to develop.""

Not everything has always gone according to plan for the pair. They have had to learn from some bumps in the road too. Neither made the U.S. squad for Qatar 2022, with Pepi's omission a particular surprise.

""Every time I think about it I'm like, 'It really happened',"" he says of receiving the call from Gregg Berhalter in which the coach explained he wasn't taking him to the World Cup. ""It caught me off-guard. Speaking to my family and my agent at the time, I felt I had a good opportunity to go, so it definitely hurt but I have used that pain as fuel to spur me onto better things.

""I remember calling my agent. I swear, for the first 10 minutes I had to convince him I wasn't joking with him. It was the same with my father, they were like, 'OK, are you done playing now?'.

""It was difficult but, in a way, I'm grateful for everything that happened. You've just got to turn everything into energy.""

Tillman nods.

""I had a similar experience,"" he says. ""It was hard, but I feel I've also bounced back pretty quickly and became a better player.""

In their downtime, the pair play video games, watch Twitch, and Tillman likes to follow his brother playing for LAFC -- especially in September, when they felt the full force of a Lionel Messi-inspired Inter Miami.

""He said you can't get close to Messi,"" says Tillman. ""He's amazing. Even if you get close, he always has an idea or knows what he's going to do. It's always a good move.

""For me, he's the best. I'm not surprised he did well, but I've never played MLS.""

To totally switch off from the game, Pepi has another hobby.

""Most of the time I'm just watching Anime,"" he says about days off. ""I love Naruto. It's my go-to. I grew up with an uncle and brother who enjoyed it and about three years ago I really got into it.

""Sometimes I will play video games with my friends back home. Most of them go to school (university), so they have some free time in the middle of the day and we get some spare time to play FIFA.""

Both are hoping for fewer days off this summer if their club form can convince Berhalter to pick them in his Copa America squad. The USMNT's recent experiments with a traditional No 10 role have encouraged Tillman in particular.

""I'd prefer to play as a real No 10,"" he says. ""But obviously we also have Gio (Reyna), who is a great player. We have a good squad with strong competition in every area.""

That includes up front. ""We have different profiles of strikers,"" says Pepi. ""We have (Folarin) Balogun for starters, who is very good, a strong runner, and then maybe I'm more of a physical profile.""

""It's going to be good for the U.S. if we do well, it'll put a different eye on us,"" Tillman says. ""Then we're going to see what the future brings. I think we have a lot of potential and we can do great things but the same as here we have to do our best first of all.""

Both know they can turn to Dest for advice on how to become USMNT regulars. So what do they make of their star full-back?

""He is crazy in some ways,"" says Tillman, laughing. ""Well maybe not crazy but different from other guys. For example, the red card after Trinidad (in November's CONCACAF Nations League defeat). He's not like that at all off the pitch. He's a good guy. He's calm.""

Pepi sees elements of both of them in their more experienced team-mate. ""I'd say he's a mixture of both of us,"" he says. ""He can be very chill and sometimes he comes in and he's really serious and doing his own thing. Other days, he'll clown about a little. It just depends on what side of the bed he wakes up. He's a mix. A good guy.""

And what about each other?

Pepi goes first, with a comprehensive verdict on his friend. ""I knew he was a good player before he came here,"" he says. ""But just watching him on the pitch; some of the turns he makes and how aware he is of players around him, his technique, it's great. He's great in between the lines and can really give that final ball. Some of the moves he makes it's like, 'Woah, I didn't see that coming'.""

Tillman warms to the task, with a twinkle in his eyes. ""Amazing finishing,"" he starts, then giggles. ""Brilliant heading... No, if you watch training, you would see his heading. Sometimes it's a bit off but he switches it on in games...""

At this, the big striker interrupts. ""That's true, but that's where it counts!""

""I would say he's a good player to combine with,"" continues Tillman. ""I like linking up on the pitch. He makes good runs in behind and he's really strong off the ball in terms of pressing. He's quick too.

""I think he's a really good striker with loads of potential.""

Potential is one quality both possess in abundance: the No 10 and the striker combining well in the Netherlands with their sights set on doing the same back home in a few months on the big stage.",nytimes.com,news,The New York Times,,0.2549019607843137,453323963,100,https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/02/16165935/PSV-Dest-Tillman-Pepi.png,

Each week we bring you updates on how American players in leagues around Europe fared over the weekend.

What should his central defensive partnership look like? How can he replace the injured Sergino Dest at full-back? Which of his in-form midfielders gets the nod to start?

But there is one thing of which he can be absolutely sure: the USMNT head coach will have the galvanising benefit of his best player arriving at the tournament off the back of the best form of his career to date.

Christian Pulisic's brace for AC Milan on Saturday took his goal tally for the campaign so far to 12, making him the first Rossoneri midfielder to score more than 10 goals, excluding penalties, in a single season since Kaka in 2005-06 (11).

His man-of-the-match performance in the 5-1 win over Cagliari, a victory that almost ensures Milan will finish runners-up to rivals Inter, was a delight for Americans seeking evidence that their team can seriously compete against the South American big guns at the tournament.

Featuring on both sides of the attack, Pulisic scored with both feet and proved a constant menace for the Sardinian side.

He has 26 goal contributions across all competitions for his club with two games remaining, an even more impressive feat given it is his first season in Italy since last summer's move from Chelsea in a deal worth up to €22million ($24.2m; £18.8m).

Pulisic's rapid adaptation and consistently good form has even surprised Milan boss Stefano Pioli, the man who pushed to sign him.

""In my opinion, Pulisic is a phenomenal player because he has quality in his choices, an intensity throughout the match which is exceptional,"" he told DAZN.

""When I met him this summer on Zoom, I had very positive perceptions, but then working together was even better than I thought: for the quality of the player, the quality of the person and the professional that he is.""

Next up for Pulisic are games against Torino and Salernitana before he reports for international duty ahead of the Copa America, which begins on June 20.

Cameron Carter-Vickers is tantalisingly close to picking up his third Scottish title winner's medal after helping Celtic to a decisive Old Firm derby win.

Brendan Rodgers' team edged out 10-man Rangers 2-1 at Parkhead on Saturday to move six points clear at the top of the table, meaning they need just one point from games against Kilmarnock and St Mirren to secure the title again.

Carter-Vickers played a significant role in the pivotal victory, with the 26-year-old making six clearances, winning seven duels (according to FotMob) and helping create Matt O'Riley's opening goal for the hosts with an arrowed long ball to Callum McGregor, who then teed up the midfielder.

With Chris Richards also in impressive form at Crystal Palace, who again on Saturday as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1 at Molineux, the pair offer Berhalter an interesting alternative partnership for the summer.

""Surgery went well! Thank GOD! Now it's time to look forward.""

Sergino Dest kept fans updated after surgery on his damaged cruciate ligament. He revealed on Instagram that the procedure had been a success, next to a picture of him leaving hospital in a wheelchair.

Dest will be a big miss for the USMNT this summer, and his injury has also cast uncertainty over his club future with Dutch champions PSV hoping to negotiate a new deal with Barcelona to sign him permanently this summer.

Name: Nicholas Gioacchini

Club: Como

Position: Forward

Appearances: 9

The 23-year-old has had limited game time for his club Como in Italy's second tier since joining in January, with one start and eight introductions from the bench. But he will be extra-incentivised to build on that next term, after Como sealed promotion to Serie A at the weekend with a 1-1 draw against Cosenza.

Gioacchini, who joined on a three-and-a-half-year deal from St Louis City, has eight caps for the national team.

Name: Josh Sargent

Club: Norwich City

Position: Striker

Appearances: 29

Goals: 16

Sargent was forced off in Norwich's goalless Championship play-off first-leg draw with Leeds United on Sunday. The nature and severity of the 24-year-old's ankle injury is not yet clear, but fans of club and country will hope the prolific front man has not had a recurrence of the problems that caused him to miss the first part of the season in England.

Paredes started his side's 2-0 defeat by Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Sunday.

The 21-year-old created a chance and all his crosses and long balls were accurate, according to Fotmob, while he made two interceptions and three recoveries for his team.

Name: Gio Reyna

Club: Nottingham Forest

Position: Midfield

Appearances (for Dortmund and Forest): 24

Reyna was left out of the Forest squad for their 3-2 defeat by Chelsea on Saturday with no explanation provided by manager Nuno Espirito Santo.

Name: Folarin Balogun

Club: Monaco

Position: Striker

Appearances: 31

Goals: 8

Balogun provided an assist in second-placed Monaco's 2-0 win at Montpellier on Sunday. The victory kept them in a strong position to qualify for next season's Champions League.

Name: Gabriel Slonina

Club: KAS Eupen

Position: Goalkeeper

Appearances: 34

The USMNT youngster, who is set to play for his country at this summer's Paris Olympics, kept a clean sheet in doomed KAS Eupen's final fixture of their relegation round play-offs in the Belgian Pro League.

Eupen beat RWDM 2-0 on Saturday, but have already been condemned to the drop. Slonina is expected to return to parent club Chelsea for pre-season.

Name: Lennard Maloney

Club: Heidenheim

Position: Midfield

Appearances: 30

Goals: 2

The 24-year-old recovered from missing two games with injury to come off the bench for his side's 1-1 draw at Freiburg on Saturday. Maloney, who has had a strong season in Bundesliga, played 24 minutes in the second half.

On Saturday, Jordan Pefok and Joe Scally will hope to feature as Borussia Monchengladbach face third-place Stuttgart in the Bundesliga (9.30am ET, ESPN+).

Dumfries is coming towards the end of his third season with Inter after arriving from PSV Eindhoven in 2021 and has helped the Nerazzurri win back-to-back Coppa Italia titles, three successive Supercoppa Italiana titles and this year's Serie A.

But according to Italian publication La Gazzetta dello Sport, Dumfries is 'heading towards the exit' at the San Siro and the Premier League has emerged as the 'most attractive' option for the Netherlands international.

Manchester United's interest dates back to January 2023 and Villa are said to have added the 28-year-old to their shopping list, with Unai Emery keen to strengthen his squad ahead of the 2024/25 campaign.

The report claims Inter have slapped a €30million (£26m) price tag on Dumfries and the Dutchman's entourage are aware that United and Villa are circling.

Red Bull Salzburg full-back Amar Dedic, who is valued at around €20m (£17m), has been identified as a potential replacement for Dumfries in Simone Inzaghi's squad.

Dumfries' current deal expires in 2025, meaning Inter must decide whether to sell the wing-back this summer or risk losing him on a free transfer in 12 months time.

There have been no signs of an agreement being reached between Dumfries and Inter over a possible contract renewal, with the player said to be demanding a salary of €5million (£4.3m) to extend his stay.

Recent reports indicated that Dumfries 'would like' to push through a move to United to play under fellow countryman Erik ten Hag.

It's believed Inter offered Dumfries to United in exchange for Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the January transfer window but this was this was rejected out of hand by the Old Trafford giants.

Quizzed on his future last month, Dumfries insisted talks over a possible extension with the newly crowned Serie A champions were 'going well' despite reports in Italy suggesting otherwise.

'We haven't been working on that yet. Because we've still been working to win the Scudetto. Now the European Championships are also approaching as well,' he said.

'You never know how things will go. But the talks have been going well.

'The club is going through a particular moment, but I expect that the talks will resume soon.'",independent.ng,news,Independent Newspapers Nigeria,,0.411764705882353,453297891,1,https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Denzel-Dumfries.jpg,eng-9562915

There have been no signs of an agreement being reached between Dumfries and Inter over a possible contract renewal, with the player said to be demanding a salary of €5million (£4.3m) to extend his stay.

Recent reports indicated that Dumfries 'would like' to push through a move to United to play under fellow countryman Erik ten Hag.

It's believed Inter offered Dumfries to United in exchange for Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the January transfer window but this was this was rejected out of hand by the Old Trafford giants.

Quizzed on his future last month, Dumfries insisted talks over a possible extension with the newly crowned Serie A champions were 'going well' despite reports in Italy suggesting otherwise.

'We haven't been working on that yet. Because we've still been working to win the Scudetto. Now the European Championships are also approaching as well,' he said.

'You never know how things will go. But the talks have been going well.

'The club is going through a particular moment, but I expect that the talks will resume soon.'

Villa have an intriguing summer ahead, especially if they are to book their place in next season's Champions League - which they can do on Monday night if they beat Liverpool.

Dumfries, 28, is a Dutch international who has contributed to nine goals from right-back in 34 appearances for Inter this term, as they won the league at a canter. They've lost only two matches in Serie A this season, with two matches left to play, and Dumfries has been a regular fixture in the side.

He has a single year remaining on his contract at the San Siro and reports in Italy this week claim that Dumfries could leave this summer in order to raise funds for the club to reinvest in recruitment, so that they can address other areas of their squad which they're looking to improve. Manchester United are also reportedly interested in Dumfries.

Inter already have a replacement in mind for Dumfries, who has played 130 times for the club since joining the club from PSV Eindhoven three years ago. They're reportedly eyeing Amar Dedic from RB Salzburg. Inter, meanwhile, are said to value Dumfries at £30m.

Villa are expected to be busy irrespective of which European competition they find themselves in next season. While Champions League is still something to be confirmed, they've already secured Europa League football at the very least. Defensively, Unai Emery may have a few decisions to make this summer.

Matty Cash is the club's only current senior right-back, although Villa also have Kosta Nedeljkovic arriving from Red Star Belgrade after they signed him in January. Clement Lenglet's loan from Barcelona will end, while Villa are expected to welcome back Tyrone Mings in pre-season.

BUNDESLIGA RELEGATION FIGHT

Cologne set up a dramatic Bundesliga finale for next week after scoring twice in the final minutes to come from 2-1 down against relegation rivals Union Berlin and snatch a last-gasp 3-2 victory.

The result lifted Cologne, in 17th place, to 27 points, three behind Union, who sit 16th in the relegation playoff spot, with one game left to play.

Cologne travel to Heidenheim on Saturday needing a win and for Union to lose against Freiburg while also making up a three-goal difference.

The bottom two teams are relegated, with Darmstadt 98 having already been confirmed as the basement club.

ANNOYED COACH SEES PSV MISS OUT ON POINTS RECORD

PSV Eindhoven´s hopes of ending a dominant Dutch league season with a record points haul fell flat on Sunday in a 1-1 draw at Fortuna Sittard that angered their coach.

With one game left next Sunday at home to RKC Waalwijk, it means they can finish with a maximum of 91 points, two short of Ajax Amsterdam´s 52-year-old record.

PSV had to scramble a late equaliser after Sittard had gone ahead midway through the first half.

""I was annoyed for all 90 minutes,"" said PSV coach Peter Bosz. ""I didn´t see any good football. I can't believe anyone in the stadium thought: 'Gosh, what a nice afternoon´. There may have been a reason after winning the championship, but that should not be an excuse.""

PSV have enjoyed a week of protracted celebrations after securing the title last Sunday

MOTTA TO LEAVE BOLOGNA?

Bologna were assured of Champions League qualification on Sunday for the first since time since they played in the 1964-65 European Cup preliminary round.

The surprise team of the Serie A season are in third place and have become a well-oiled machine under Thiago Motta.

However, the 41-year-old might not lead the side next season as his contract is set to expire and Italian media suggest he has an agreement in principle with Juventus.

The former Inter Milan and Paris St Germain player has not made any public statements yet, but it would be difficult for Motta to turn down spearheading his own project at Juve.

Borussia Dortmund's most expensive signing of every season since 2010,"Borussia Dortmund are renowned for the players they end up selling, but that's because the Bundesliga club are brilliant at signing players - as this list of their most expensive purchases since 2010 demonstrates.

Dortmund have given some of the game's biggest names the platform they needed to blossom, going on to invest fees received into purchasing their next big project.

We've checked in on their most expensive signing from every season since 2010-11 to see where they all are these days; it's quite the list...

Months after only a volcanic eruption stopped him from joining Sam Allardyce's Blackburn Rovers, Lewandowski was whisked to Dortmund for just €4.5million - and the rest is history.

The Polish goalscoring sensation helped the club secure back-to-back Bundesliga titles and after netting a bucket load of goals, the club banked around £42.5million when selling him to Bayern Munich.

Still scoring goals today for Barcelona at 35 years old, and set to appear for his country at Euro 2024, there is little doubt that Lewandowski ranks among the best strikers of all time.

Gundogan wasn't the finished article when Klopp picked him up from Nuremberg for €5.5million, but the German coach saw his potential and has been vindicated several times over.

""When I came to Dortmund at the age of 20, I had an adaptation problem,"" Gundogan told Turkish TV channel Tivibu Spor.

""The first six months were tough for me. But Klopp helped me because he treated his players like a father figure, like a friend. He was always with me, gave me confidence. I spent five successful years with him.""

After collecting 14 trophies with Man City, becoming one of the best players in their history, the midfielder is now strutting his stuff for Barcelona.

Signed from Borussia Monchengladbach for €17million, Reus would go on to score 169 goals and provide 130 assists in 426 appearances for Dortmund.

The midfielder announced his departure from the club at the end of the 2023-24 season in an emotional video to the fans.

His last game looks set to be the Champions League final against Real Madrid, a fitting end for one of Dortmund's greats.

Signed for a fee of €27.5million, Mkhitaryan became the club's most expensive signing as Dortmund looked to soothe the pain of losing the Champions League final the previous May.

The Armenian playmaker managed to live up to the hype too, scoring 41 goals across three seasons before the club then sold him for a profit.

Following stints with Man Utd, Arsenal and Roma, the Armenian playmaker is still going strong for Inter Milan to this day.

The 35-year-old has chipped in with 12 goal contributions from midfield to help Simone Inzaghi's side win the Serie A title.

Klopp's last season at Dortmund was a bit wonky, with the Bundesliga giants sleepwalking into a relegation battle before pulling themselves to mid-table safety in the spring.

Signed for €18.5million from Torino, Immobile's time in Germany never really went according to plan and he never showed his best form in the Bundesliga.

Happily, the Italy striker has since built his reputation back up with Lazio and is still scoring goals regularly to this day.

After replacing Klopp, Thomas Tuchel made Castro his most expensive signing in his first summer at Dortmund, snapping him up for €11million from rivals Bayer Leverkusen.

He only spent three fairly middling years with Dortmund, however, leaving for Stuttgart in 2018 before eventually retiring with Arminia Bielefeld in 2022.

Signing Dembele for just €35million in 2016 felt like somewhat of a steal for a winger who had quietly become Europe's most promising talents at Rennes.

With 10 goals and 21 assists from 49 games in his debut season, a star had been born - and he was whisked away from Dortmund for a whopping £97million plus add-ons in the summer of 2017, with Barcelona swiftly replacing outbound Neymar.

Dembele now finds himself at the club Neymar ditched Barcelona for, joining PSG in the summer of 2023. His return to French football has been modest thus far, but the 26-year-old often produces Ballon d'Or-worthy form when you least expect it.

Having been a Rumour Mill staple for much of the 2010s, Yarmolenko was eventually snapped up by Dortmund in 2017, with Dynamo Kyiv receiving €25million for the Ukraine international.

Six goals in 26 appearances was a below-average return in his only season at Dortmund, who were happy to sell the winger for €20million to West Ham.

In many ways, Yarmolenko was the archetypal Hammers signing; talented, inconsistent, often injured but delivered memorable moments such as his winners against Chelsea in 2020 and Sevilla in 2022.

Now 34, he's back at Kyiv and will captain Ukraine at this summer's European Championship.

Diallo's performances at Mainz convinced Dortmund to bring him to the Westfalenstadion for €28million in 2018.

Tuchel, by now with PSG, was watching from afar and took defender Diallo off their hands in a €32millon deal one year later, but by 2022 he'd been loaned back to Germany with RB Leipzig, then sold a year later to Qatari side Al-Arabi.

At only 28, it's a bit of a shame to see him head to the Middle East so soon.

After three years at Bayern Munich, Hummels returned home to Dortmund for a fee of €30.5million in 2019.

The 35-year-old has made almost 200 appearances back at the club and is tipped to start for Germany when they host Euro 2024. He also scored the winner against PSG in the Champions League semis. Fair play.

After contributing to 79 goals in 116 appearances for PSV Eindhoven, Malen was snapped up by Dortmund as a replacement for Manchester United-bound Jadon Sancho.

Costing €30million, the Netherlands international has scored 33 times and provided 19 assists during his three years in Germany and has been linked with his own move to Old Trafford.

We get a feeling that Sancho might just be warning his team-mate against that.

After shaking off his West Ham nightmare at Ajax, Haller was the subject of a €31million move to Dortmund in the summer of 2022 only to be diagnosed with testicular cancer less than two weeks later.

The subject of an outpouring of support from across football, the striker endured chemotherapy and two lots of surgery before returning to action in February 2023.

Haller has 12 goals in 40 appearances for Dortmund and also scored the winner for Ivory Coast in the 2023 AFCON final.

Nmecha came through the ranks at Manchester City, but never really threatened to break into the first team and was sold to Wolfsburg in 2021.

Two productive years in the Bundesliga convinced Dortmund to splash €30million on the midfielder in 2023, although his transfer was controversial to some supporters due to past comments on social media that were regarded as homophobic and transphobic.

Nevertheless, Nmecha was enjoyed a fine debut season at the club and scored in the Champions League group stage victory at Newcastle in October 2023.",planetfootball.com,news,Planet Football,Michael Lee,0.2,453107483,1,https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd3nfwcxd527z59.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F05%2F10122122%2Fdortmund-where-are-they-now.jpg,eng-9547956

In Sergino Dest, Malik Tillman and Ricardo Pepi, PSV have three bright young talents who have also captured the imagination of USMNT fans in a year when the Copa America will take place on home soil, a warm-up of sorts before the 2026 World Cup being co-hosted with Canada and Mexico.

The Athletic visited the Netherlands in February to speak to them...

It's carnival time in Eindhoven; everyone dons fancy dress -- from dinosaurs to hippies to fairies and even the odd PSV kit -- and then gathers together.

The city's football team has won again and there is an understandably upbeat atmosphere around their impressive training ground on its rural outskirts.

At 23 years old, Dest is the elder statesman of the club's USMNT contingent (Tillman and Pepi are both 21). The defender is enjoying being a mainstay of the team following two difficult seasons at his Spanish parent club Barcelona -- who he joined for €21million ($22.5m) from Amsterdam's Ajax in October 2020 -- and then Italy's AC Milan on loan.

His contract at Camp Nou runs until 2025 but last summer he was offered the chance to return to the Netherlands. PSV would like to sign him permanently too but will try and negotiate a new deal with the Catalans after the knee injury which could rule him out for up to nine months.

He has said he would be open to staying and for Dest, a large part of his comfort in Eindhoven is based around something he has perhaps lacked in recent years: honesty.

It is a theme he keeps returning to in conversation.

""That's what makes this club so special; you can have normal conversations with people and they're upfront, even if sometimes you don't like to hear some things,"" Dest says. ""They respect you and treat you well and, for me, that's very important. If people respect you, you will feel better and play better. The same goes the other way round.

""The coach (Peter Bosz) is usually very calm with us and he's confident in us. Even if we have a game where we don't play as well as we can, he still believes in us. We have a lot of quality and we are always able to turn things around. That's important.""

PSV would ultimately become champions in May, but Dest explained the relentless ethic which meant nobody at the club let themselves believe the title was already in the bag.

""We can't enjoy it fully yet,"" says Dest. ""We have to concentrate. We're confident we're going to be champions but... there is still a lot that can change. We want to break records and if you want to do that you have to stay focused.""

The challenge for Bosz is to keep his players' eyes on the prize, while also ensuring young talents such as Tillman and Pepi can flourish despite not being starting regulars. Up front, club icon Luuk de Jong has retired from international duty to dedicate himself to his domestic dreams in his second spell at PSV. In midfield, various talents jostle to play behind him.

Dest is a strong personality -- not one to follow the herd. He is unsure if he would ever want the job of leading a club from the technical area, though.

""I don't think I'll ever want to be a coach,"" he says. ""Maybe I would like to be one of the assistants. Perhaps the technical skills coach or whatever. I'd maybe consider that one day, but as for head coach? No, I don't think so. I like to be a little bit in the background, not talking all the time and explaining myself.""

In 2022, Dest's father Kenneth explained to The Athletic how not being front and centre is nothing new for his son.

""They (his schoolteachers) always noticed that whenever the students had to do things together, he always was outside the circle a bit, observing the people, not really in the middle of it,"" said Kenneth Dest. ""That was his nature, seeing what type of individuals they were; not always jumping in, a bit quiet.""

Dest was also attracted when this potential move to the Philips Stadium came up by the presence at the club of Earnie Stewart as technical director. The 55-year-old was formerly sporting director at the United States Soccer Federation, where he played a part in nurturing Dest's progress to the senior team; and like the defender, he was born here in the Netherlands and played for USMNT.

""We have always had a really nice and honest connection,"" says Dest of Stewart. ""I don't see him every day but he's always there for me. I feel comfortable around him. But I'm also not that person that, if I know someone, I'll take advantage. Again, I like to be in the background and just observe.

""I can rely on myself. Even if the coach was my dad, I wouldn't do it.""

Dest may be of the media-schooled generation but he is comfortable speaking his mind.

Take this summer's Copa America. He knows the easy soundbite would be to say he is thrilled for the competition -- effectively the South American federation's championship, like the Euros or Africa Cup of Nations, but with some invited guest nations involved too -- to take place on home soil, and that the USMNT can go all the way. Likewise at the World Cup in 2026.

""We are a young team, and when we went to the 2022 World Cup we were on an upward curve but we also had some setbacks,"" explains Dest, who started all four of his country's games in Qatar, and assisted Christian Pulisic's goal in the 1-0 win over Iran, but will miss the Copa after tearing his ACL.

""The line isn't always rising though, it can go down. We need to get back to our shape now, get back together. At this moment I think if we were to play the World Cup tomorrow, we would not be ready.""

Will this summer, then, provide a better indication of the USMNT's ability to challenge for major honours?

""Yes. The Copa can have a great effect and we will also see where we stand, but even that is (four) months from now,"" Dest says. ""In that time, a lot can still happen.

""The warm-up game against Colombia (in June, two weeks before the tournament) will be amazing. A great opponent we can test ourselves against.

""I would love to have had it (Copa America) in South America. The future is the most important in my opinion, over money and everything, so I'm kind of disappointed in some ways that it's not in one of those nations. That's where it started and where it should be.

""It's like you're playing the Euros in Africa. It doesn't make sense to me. But nowadays everything is about the money. I'd love to have seen it in Brazil or Colombia and seen that passion for football. It should be a culture thing; for the fans it is, but for others it's business, unfortunately.""

Despite his troubles, Dest remains in love with football; which is why being ostracised at Milan hurt. It may also have deepened his determination to succeed, something he must rely on again as he begins months of gruelling rehabilitation on his knee.

""I was doing double sessions, extra work on the training ground and then I had personal trainers outside,"" he explains. ""I was working on my passes, fitness and strength. I had the time to do it and do it without factoring in getting sore after games and that recovery.

""It was even looking at my diet. Obviously, if you don't play that much, you still burn a lot (of energy) in training but I cut down my carbs. I didn't feel the need for them to be as high. After a couple of days it was hard, but I got used to it.""

If Dest is one of PSV's main men, sitting in the canteen at De Herdgang, the club's training ground, are two of the club's young contenders.

Tillman and Pepi are fresh from a post-training strength and conditioning session in the gym, and ready to unwind after a busy 24 hours. The previous evening, they made their usual impact from the bench as PSV swept aside Volendam. Pepi had only been on the field for two minutes when he confidently scored their fourth goal, and Tillman created two chances during his 18-minute cameo.

They are two of the USMNT's most exciting young talents, and featuring in this all-conquering club side is providing them a platform to show their ability -- even if a little patience is required.

Tillman and Pepi both arrived at PSV last summer. Striker Pepi, formerly of FC Dallas in MLS, arrived in a €9million ($9.8m) July deal from German top-flight club Augsburg; Tillman joined on loan from Bayern Munich the following month, after spending the previous season on loan at Glasgow side Rangers in Scotland.

El Paso, Texas-born Pepi would probably walk into most other teams in the Eredivisie, but at PSV he faces the task of getting into the game ahead of De Jong.

Tillman must edge out either experienced central midfielder Jerdy Schouten or explosive Belgium international winger Johan Bakayoko. Such is the way at a team competing for glory on multiple fronts.

But as Pepi sips a coffee across from his friend, it seems neither is letting the lack of starts weigh too heavily on them.

""He hasn't been sitting on the bench as much as I have but when we do, we normally sit next to each other,"" says Pepi. ""We're usually watching the game and talking about stuff. We have a good relationship.

""I knew something about him before I came, but we didn't have this special connection then.""

Tillman, who was born in the German city of Nuremberg to a German mother and American father, understands enough Dutch to be the pair's main translator, while Pepi picked some up last season during a spell on loan at Groningen, another Eredivisie team.

The duo featured in PSV's Champions League campaign too, with Pepi scoring the header that secured a 3-2 away win against Spain's Sevilla in November, and with it progress into the knockout stage.

""I was pleased for him because normally this guy can't head a ball, man,"" laughs Tillman, who joined the club permanently on May 10.

Pepi pretends to be offended, before they both laugh.

""It was a dream come true,"" he says. ""I remember leaving school to watch these games (in the Champions League, which kick off during weekday afternoons in the States because of the time difference to Europe) as a kid, so to actually score in one was indescribable. It was more about scoring in such an important game that we had to win.

""I've watched it back. It's a thing where, in the moment, you don't really focus on it because you've got so much adrenaline, but it hits later.""

Pepi, though, is no stranger to performing when it matters.

On his USMNT senior debut in September 2021, he scored and provided an assist to help beat Honduras 4-1 and lift the side's World Cup qualification hopes.

His knack for getting on target when it counts has produced rave reviews since his days in MLS and explains his Spanish-language nickname, 'El tren'. ""When I broke through at Dallas I scored a few goals and people started talking about a hype train,"" he explains. ""So in Spanish it was, 'El tren'.""

Tillman has also been talked up a lot since joining Bayern in 2015 along with his brother Timothy (who now plays for LAFC in MLS).

Last season, he scored 10 goals (with four assists) for Rangers and experienced a whole new level of intensity via their Old Firm derby games.

""Wow,"" he says reflecting on those games against fellow Glasgow side Celtic. ""A lot of tension. Unfortunately, we didn't win any of them while I was there, but it was a good experience.

""After the first game against Celtic, I remember we weren't allowed any away fans any more in the stadium, so it was just the whole stadium against you. If you score, nobody is going to cheer. It was crazy... completely different.

""Here, we have a big rivalry with Feyenoord (the previous champions, from Rotterdam). In Glasgow, it's more the stuff around other things like religion when the fans fight and go a bit crazy.""

Pepi picks up the theme. ""When it comes to Feyenoord here, you can feel that every duel you make on the pitch is way more intense,"" he says. ""It's kind of fierce.""

Both players stand at over 6ft (183cm). Tillman is quieter but quick to smile, with Pepi more confident in conversation.

Both are likeable and club staff speak of them in high regard, as does manager Bosz -- even if he chose a dose of tough love for Tillman in September when he was dropped from the squad for an away game after missing a morning meeting before the team made the 80-minute drive north to face Almere City.

""I overslept,"" he says, still bashful at the memory. ""I didn't make it to the training ground and when I knew I wouldn't get there in time I called the team manager and told him. At first, he said OK come straight to the hotel but then he called again and said he's spoken to the coach (Bosz) and I should stay home. So, yeah, I stayed home. I apologised to the team and afterwards I showed I have learned from it.

""It's the worst feeling,"" he says, as we expand on the topic of being late when you're in elite sport.

""I guess I can laugh about it now. Or the team can,"" adds Tillman. ""The worst was coming in the next day and everyone knew what happened and they're going to look at you. It's part of it.""

Both understood why Bosz responded how he did. ""We're winning every weekend and want to be champions so we have got to keep each other on our toes,"" says Pepi.

They each have title winners' medals now, and Tillman's season had an extra positive outcome when he signed his four-year contract to remain a PSV player with Bosz's endorsement. ""He is only 21 years old, but has already taken so many steps in his development this year,"" said the manager. ""That is nice to see and I am curious to see how he will continue to develop.""

Not everything has always gone according to plan for the pair. They have had to learn from some bumps in the road too. Neither made the U.S. squad for Qatar 2022, with Pepi's omission a particular surprise.

""Every time I think about it I'm like, 'It really happened',"" he says of receiving the call from Gregg Berhalter in which the coach explained he wasn't taking him to the World Cup. ""It caught me off-guard. Speaking to my family and my agent at the time, I felt I had a good opportunity to go, so it definitely hurt but I have used that pain as fuel to spur me onto better things.

""I remember calling my agent. I swear, for the first 10 minutes I had to convince him I wasn't joking with him. It was the same with my father, they were like, 'OK, are you done playing now?'.

""It was difficult but, in a way, I'm grateful for everything that happened. You've just got to turn everything into energy.""

Tillman nods.

""I had a similar experience,"" he says. ""It was hard, but I feel I've also bounced back pretty quickly and became a better player.""

In their downtime, the pair play video games, watch Twitch, and Tillman likes to follow his brother playing for LAFC -- especially in September, when they felt the full force of a Lionel Messi-inspired Inter Miami.

""He said you can't get close to Messi,"" says Tillman. ""He's amazing. Even if you get close, he always has an idea or knows what he's going to do. It's always a good move.

""For me, he's the best. I'm not surprised he did well, but I've never played MLS.""

To totally switch off from the game, Pepi has another hobby.

""Most of the time I'm just watching Anime,"" he says about days off. ""I love Naruto. It's my go-to. I grew up with an uncle and brother who enjoyed it and about three years ago I really got into it.

""Sometimes I will play video games with my friends back home. Most of them go to school (university), so they have some free time in the middle of the day and we get some spare time to play FIFA.""

Both are hoping for fewer days off this summer if their club form can convince Berhalter to pick them in his Copa America squad. The USMNT's recent experiments with a traditional No 10 role have encouraged Tillman in particular.

""I'd prefer to play as a real No 10,"" he says. ""But obviously we also have Gio (Reyna), who is a great player. We have a good squad with strong competition in every area.""

That includes up front. ""We have different profiles of strikers,"" says Pepi. ""We have (Folarin) Balogun for starters, who is very good, a strong runner, and then maybe I'm more of a physical profile.""

""It's going to be good for the U.S. if we do well, it'll put a different eye on us,"" Tillman says. ""Then we're going to see what the future brings. I think we have a lot of potential and we can do great things but the same as here we have to do our best first of all.""

Both know they can turn to Dest for advice on how to become USMNT regulars. So what do they make of their star full-back?

""He is crazy in some ways,"" says Tillman, laughing. ""Well maybe not crazy but different from other guys. For example, the red card after Trinidad (in November's CONCACAF Nations League defeat). He's not like that at all off the pitch. He's a good guy. He's calm.""

Pepi sees elements of both of them in their more experienced team-mate. ""I'd say he's a mixture of both of us,"" he says. ""He can be very chill and sometimes he comes in and he's really serious and doing his own thing. Other days, he'll clown about a little. It just depends on what side of the bed he wakes up. He's a mix. A good guy.""

And what about each other?

Pepi goes first, with a comprehensive verdict on his friend. ""I knew he was a good player before he came here,"" he says. ""But just watching him on the pitch; some of the turns he makes and how aware he is of players around him, his technique, it's great. He's great in between the lines and can really give that final ball. Some of the moves he makes it's like, 'Woah, I didn't see that coming'.""

Tillman warms to the task, with a twinkle in his eyes. ""Amazing finishing,"" he starts, then giggles. ""Brilliant heading... No, if you watch training, you would see his heading. Sometimes it's a bit off but he switches it on in games...""

At this, the big striker interrupts. ""That's true, but that's where it counts!""

""I would say he's a good player to combine with,"" continues Tillman. ""I like linking up on the pitch. He makes good runs in behind and he's really strong off the ball in terms of pressing. He's quick too.

""I think he's a really good striker with loads of potential.""

Potential is one quality both possess in abundance: the No 10 and the striker combining well in the Netherlands with their sights set on doing the same back home in a few months on the big stage.",theathletic.com,news,The Athletic,Greg O'Keeffe,0.1764705882352942,453056592,100,https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/02/16165935/PSV-Dest-Tillman-Pepi.png,eng-9558123

Policing football matches in England last season cost taxpayers more than £30m as reveals for the first time the true burden on the public purse of keeping people safe at stadiums.

The Premier League, which inked a new £6.7bn television rights deal in December, accounted for around half of the total, with forces incurring costs of at least £15.3m for policing top-flight matches, figures obtained under multiple Freedom of Information requests show.

Pressure has been growing on clubs to pay the significant policing bill football generates. During what has been described as a police funding crisis, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley and former Home Secretary Priti Patel have called for clubs to contribute more.

Such is the concern, can reveal that last year the UK Football Policing Unit sent a spreadsheet to all forces in the country asking them to provide the cost of working at games in the 2019-20 and 2022-23 season, explaining the exercise was ""to establish the estimated total national cost of football policing in order to raise awareness of the significant cost and resource impact of non-chargeable policing activity"".

Following 's FOI request to see the figures, the National Police Chiefs' Council conducted a thorough consultation process with forces. The response stated that the NPCC ""wishes to stress that some issues of data accuracy have been raised"" and that the figures should be considered as estimates.

A limited number of police forces indicated that some figures provided were projections or estimates, while some data from forces was missing or not broken down for individual clubs.

The biggest burden on taxpayers came from the Big Six - considered the most lucrative clubs in the country - and teams based in London.

Games at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium cost £2.9m to police, Arsenal fixtures at the Emirates Stadium cost £1.8m and Merseyside police spent £1.6m working on Liverpool matches at Anfield.

Manchester United games, played at Old Trafford, required £1.5m of police resources, Chelsea's Stamford Bridge cost £1.4m and last season's Treble winners Manchester City, who play at the Etihad Stadium, cost £900,000. West Ham's London Stadium cost £1.5m.

Meanwhile, Premier League clubs spent a record-high £2.36bn on transfers in the summer 2023 window, according to financial firm Deloitte.

More detailed Metropolitan Police data obtained by shows that Tottenham's games required significantly higher levels of policing than any club in the country and Champions League fixtures were particularly resource-intensive.

When Tottenham hosted Eintracht Frankfurt in October 2022, 604 officers were required, costing £300,000. More than 500 officers were present for games against Arsenal, Portsmouth, West Ham and Chelsea, costing more than £1m in total.

Arsenal's north London derby home game against Tottenham last season required 350 officers at a total cost of £180,000. Their game against PSV Eindhoven in October 2022 needed 300 officers at a cost of £154,000. A further 225 officers worked when Arsenal hosted FC Zurich a fortnight later, at a cost of £115,000.

At Chelsea, hundreds of officers were required for games against Tottenham, West Ham United, Leicester City, Dinamo Zagreb, Leeds United and Borussia Dortmund.

West Ham regularly required several hundred officers to police matches, including against Tottenham, Anderlecht, Chelsea, Gent, AZ Alkmaar and Leeds United. Almost £40,000 was spent policing the victory parade after West Ham won the Uefa Conference League in May 2023, when thousands of fans filled the streets of east London.

Crystal Palace's derby match against Brighton required 275 officers, when it was played at Selhurst Park, costing £141,000.

The total cost to taxpayers of policing the Premier League last season sent to did not include the cost of two clubs - Newcastle United and Leicester City. Northumbria Police did not provide figures for Newcastle and Leicestershire Police sent costs for the 2022-23 financial year, totalling £599,000.

Premier League sources stress that clubs generate significant funds towards the public purse. According to the Premier League's last annual report, £4.2bn was contributed in the 2021-22 season.

""The Premier League and clubs work closely with police forces at a national and local level to help ensure the appropriate level of support is in place to keep match goers and local communities safe around matches,"" a Premier League spokesperson told .

""Working with the FA and the EFL, new and tougher measures have been introduced in recent seasons, as part of an all-football response, to challenge and take action against unacceptable fan behaviour.""

Anti-social behaviour, including violence, mass pitch invasions and pyrotechnic use, increased after fans were allowed back to matches following lockdowns during the Covid pandemic.

The worst scenes took place at the Euro 2020 final when the Football Association was humiliated by riots and violence as supporters tried to storm Wembley Stadium to watch England's game against Italy in 2021. The cost of policing England matches is not included in the total.

In the EFL, meanwhile, it cost forces £10.6m to police matches involving Championship clubs last season, £3.8m in League One and £2.2m in League Two.

An EFL spokesperson told : ""Ensuring the safety and security of fans, players and officials is a priority for the EFL and we value the commitment and professionalism that local police forces bring to our match days when required.

""The cost of policing football is covered by rules relating to Special Police Services and controlled by statute and case law which sees clubs responsible for the costs of police deployments on land owned or controlled by the club on a match day.""

Two police forces have failed in attempts to force clubs to pay for their services on match days. Ipswich Town sued Suffolk Police for charging the club for policing streets outside Portman Road but, after initially losing the case, in 2016 the High Court ruled the club were not responsible. West Yorkshire Police was also ordered by the courts to repay Leeds United around £1m after the force was sued by the club for charging.

It cost £284,000 to police Leeds United games in the Premier League last season. Suffolk Police did not provide a figure for the cost of policing games at Ipswich Town, who were in League One last season.

The EFL spokesperson added: ""Clubs have worked closely with local forces to reduce police presences at fixtures and it is incumbent on the police to ensure that appropriate levels of policing are deployed in line with the level of risk.

""Professional football clubs are already major contributors of revenues to the Exchequer with EFL clubs contributing hundreds of millions of pounds in tax. Football fans are also taxpayers and with 23 million attending EFL matches this season, fans will have generated billions more in taxes and are as deserving of police services as any other group of citizens.

""The EFL believes it is a fundamental principle of policing in the UK that police services for the general public are paid for through taxation and not left as services to be paid for by those who can afford them.""

On match days, any disorder inside venues is the responsibility of stewards - paid for by clubs - with the occasional assistance of police officers, when required, which is charged to clubs. Teams are usually liable to pay for maintaining order in the areas immediately outside entrances - known as the stadium ""footprint"" - but the bill for the remainder of required policing is paid by the local forces.

Police forces were able to bill Premier League clubs for £6.2m of work in the 2022-23 season - less than a third of the total cost. In the Championship, forces charged clubs £3.4m, in League One £1.3m and in League Two £722,000 - less than a quarter of the total.

For more high-profile matches, significant numbers of officers are required to maintain order, riot vans with specially trained offers are usually present and police on horseback also patrol the streets around stadiums.

revealed in January that the Premier League had agreed to pay police a one-off unconditional gift, thought to be worth £5m, to thank them for the role they play in keeping fans safe. It will be distributed to forces with one or more clubs in their remit.

A shift in kick-off times for high-profile televised fixtures has been indicative of the strain on forces. At the request of police, the two Manchester derbies this season were moved from 4.30pm to 3.30pm. Last season's FA Cup final also started at the earlier time of 3pm, and that will be the case again later this month. This season's EFL Cup final was played at 3pm, rather than 4.30pm.

It is thought that the earlier starts cut down time for fans to drink alcohol and reduce the chance of violence and disorder.",inews.co.uk,news,inews.co.uk,Sam Cunningham,0.1215686274509804,453015449,1,https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEI_203353229-1200x630-pl-exclusive.jpg,

It's well known that the Italian international has enjoyed a trophy-laden career to date, and has starred on the biggest stages for club and country, but here are 20 things you may not know about our no. 20:

Jorginho was actually born in Brazil, in the small town of Imbituba in the south of the country. He is of Italian descent through his paternal great-grandfather who is from Lusiana, Veneto. Reflecting on his decision, he said: ""Choosing Italy was easy. Brazil never gave me the chance to fulfil my dream. Italy chose me to play for them, even though I was born in another country. When I needed help, Italy helped me.""

Determined child

At the age of five, our new signing already had his sights set on his future life. When asked by his father what he wanted to do when he grew up, Jorginho replied:""'I want to be a football player."" When his father explained it would be tough, would see him spend time away from the family and the potential of serious injury, he asked him again what his future held. The reply was again: ""I want to be a football player.""

Jorginho puts his success mainly down to one person - his mother, an ex-amateur player herself who came from a footballing family ""She was the one getting me to practice,"" he has previously said. ""My mum was the one grabbing the ball and telling me: 'Come on! Let's practice now. Let's go. Right, right, left, left. I would kick the ball up and she would be like: 'No, control it like this.' And so, it went, many afternoons at the beach.""

Early sacrifices

As a teenager, Jorginho took his first steps in 11-a-side football and was quickly scouted at a tournament in Brazil. However, it would mean moving 120 miles away from his family aged 13 to join a soccer school in Guabiruba that specialised in setting up those who made the grade with moves to Italy. Two years later, Jorginho impressed and was on his way to Verona.

Jorge Luiz Frello Filho is now better known as Jorginho, but his childhood friends called him Haginho, after his idol, the legendary Romanian playmaker Gheorghe Hagi. His nickname amongst the Italian national team is 'Il Professore' (The Professor) or 'Radio Jorginho', in reference to his leadership and organisational qualities, as well as his continuous communication during games.

Under the radar

Jorginho underwent trials with three of Brazil's biggest clubs - Sao Paulo, Palmeiras and Internacional but returned from them all having been unsuccessful. ""I went back still wanting to be a football player, no matter how tough it was going to be,"" he said. ""It gave me the motivation to not give up, to believe in myself. My family believed in me, my friends believed in my potential, everyone believed in me.""

As well as Hagi, he also looked up to Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaka, but during his time in Guabiruba he was convinced to ditch any dreams of following in their footsteps and playing further forward, and was converted into the holding midfielder we know today. After that, he began studying Andrea Pirlo and Xavi to help master the position.

Never give up

When he first moved to Italy, he was handed just 20 euros a week to live on by his agent, who Jorginho later found out was pocketing some of his cash. That almost caused him to leave his new world behind, but his mother urged him to continue, saying: ""Don't even think about it! You're so close, you've been there for a few years, I won't let you back in the house! You need to stay there and hang tough.""

When he began to break into Verona's first-team, Jorginho met goalkeeper Rafael Pinheiro, who was also born in Brazil and the pair quickly formed a bond. It was Pinheiro who discovered Jorginho was being short-changed by his agent, and took him under his wing to provide him with food and clothes.

Divine inspiration

While he learnt his craft at Verona, the youngster lived in a monastery. ""There was a place for the monks and another for the scholars in the academy,' he says. ""Six of us in a little room for one and a half years. The people there treated us in an amazing way, always respectful. They really took care of us and the food was amazing. We had to be in the house by 11 o'clock.""

The first major moment of his career came when he helped Verona reach Serie A for the first time in 11 years in 2014. He then helped them into the top four of the division by netting seven goals in 18 games before Rafael Benitez signed him for Napoli in the January transfer window. In fact, current owner Maurizio Setti has since revealed he purchased the club in 2012 after realising Jorginho's talent.

Happy with Sarri

No coach has selected Jorginho more times in his career than the 162 times Maurizio Sarri has, who helped develop him into a star in Serie A during their time together at Napoli. On the day Sarri was appointed as Chelsea manager in the summer of 2018, Jorginho also signed for the club as the two continued their bond in England.

Jorginho has been a regular taker of spot-kicks throughout his career, and has netted 42 out of 50 so far, with 19 coming from 22 attempts in the Premier League - only Mohamed Salah has scored more since Jorgi's arrival in England. He finished as Chelsea's top league scorer in the 2019/20 season with seven goals - all from the spot - with his unusual technique something he admitted he picked up during training sessions at Napoli.

Touch of class

In just his third game in the division, Jorginho equalled a Premier League record in August 2018 when he touched the ball 186 times in a game against Newcastle United, and surpassed that four weeks later by recording 191 against West Ham United. While that record is now held by Manchester City's Rodri (195 v West Ham in February 2020), our new signing appears twice times in the top seven of that particular list.

After clinching Euro 2020, Jorginho joined an elite list of players to have won both the European Cup/Champions League and the European Championships in the same year. The first was Luis Suarez in 1964 who played for Inter Milan and Spain, while in 1988 Hans van Breukelen, Ronald Koeman, Berry van Aerle and Gerald Vanenburg did the double with PSV Eindhoven and the Netherlands.

In more recent times, Chelsea duo Fernando Torres and Juan Mata repeated the feat with Spain, while Cristiano Ronaldo and Pepe had been the last to do so when Real Madrid and Portugal tasted glory.

Year to remember

After winning both the Champions League and the re-arranged Euro 2020 during the 2020/21 campaign, Jorginho was awarded UEFA's Player of the Year award. After tallying the votes from national team coaches, managers involved in European competitions and a jury of journalists, the Italian international edged out Kevin de Bruyne and N'Golo Kante to pick up the prestigious prize.

The Italian actually twice netted against us during his time at Chelsea, both of which came during the 2019/20 campaign. He tapped home late on during a 2-1 success for the Blues at Emirates Stadium in December 2019, before converting from 12 yards during a chaotic 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge the following month.

That was one of just four triumphs at our expense during 10 appearances with the Blues, including victory in the 2018/19 Europa League final in Baku, but losing the FA Cup final 12 months later.

Top of the list

No Italian midfielder has scored more goals in the Premier League than Jorginho's 21 strikes. His nearest rival is Roberto di Matteo who got 15 for Chelsea, while only strikers Paulo di Canio, Gianfranco Zola, Benito Carbone, Fabrizio Ravanelli and Graziano Pelle have scored more than his current haul.

In September 2021, he captained Italy for the first time on the occasion of his 38th cap in a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania, in a game that brought a 5-0 win for Jorginho's side. That was the first time the Azzurri had been skippered by a non-native Italian since 1960, when Argentinan-born Miguel Angel Montuori donned the armband.

Jorginho is just one of three Italians to feature for us in competitive action.

Types of NIV: There are three types of Non-Invasive Positive-Pressure ventilation

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP): a constant flow of pressurized room air is provided via a face mask. The pressure setting of this airflow is often determined by a doctor based on the patient's need.

Bilevel Positive Pressure (BiPAP): The BiPAP machine can alternate between two pressures that allow breathing in with higher pressure and breathing out against a slightly lower pressure. Bilevel may be required when pressures are higher to improve comfort, especially at PAP pressures that are 15cm of water pressure or higher.

Autotitrating (Adjustable) Positive Airway Pressure (APAP): It changes pressure all night based on our breathing patterns. It has even more features to maintain normal breathing in sleep.

It can vary the volume of air delivered and the speed at which the lungs are inflated and deflated.

Drivers (High incidences of chronic conditions, Increasing intensive care admissions, Growing pollution levels and Unhealthy lifestyles)

High incidences of chronic conditions: A chronic condition is a human health condition or disease whose symptoms are persistent or long-lasting or a sickness that develops over time. A chronic condition usually affects multiple body areas, is not fully responsive to treatment, and persists for an extended period.

The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) findings suggest that 51.8% of the adults in America had at least one chronic condition, & nearly 27.2% suffer from multiple chronic cases. The prevalence was highest among women, non-Hispanic white adults, adults over 65 or older, and those residing in rural areas.

Opportunities

Technological advancements: Innovation in the area of positive airway pressure (PAP) systems, portability, and improvement in battery life are paving the way for operating efficiency. The portable ventilator market is showing sharp growth due to the high demand for ventilators compatible with different settings like remote medical facilities, ambulances, and homecare due to various life-threatening diseases.

There is a surge in the Research work done on the different modes of ventilation like Assist/Control ventilation (A/C), Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) and Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV).

Well, who could have seen that coming? Borussia Dortmund are Champions League finalists after their 2-0 aggregate win over Paris Saint-Germain. But is their presence at Wembley the unlikeliest of the Champions League era (we're skipping over the European Cup when participation was so radically different as to open the door for all sorts of surprise finalists)? Let's find out:

5. Chelsea, 2011-12

With all due respect to the Liverpool side of 2004-05, a Steven Gerrard howitzer away from elimination, this was the English champion that really shouldn't have been. Having fumbled their way out of a fairly simple group, it was no great surprise when a side utterly at sea under Andre Villas Boas were tonked 3-1 in the round of 16 first leg against Napoli, a defeat that cost the Portuguese boss his job. Had Roman Abramovich really believed that the season could be salvaged he might not have appointed former Blue Roberto Di Matteo, whose managerial CV beforehand largely encompassed promoting and relegating West Bromwich Albion.

What happened next was utterly incredible, particularly for the young university student who offered his friend odds of 50-1 of Chelsea winning the Champions League even at the semifinal stage (Alex Kealy, I suspect I probably still owe you that £250). Branislav Ivanovic's extra-time winner downed Napoli but after beating Benfica came what seemed to be the impossible job against all-conquering Barcelona. Didier Drogba carried the Blues through the first leg but the tie seemed done when Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta netted either side of a John Terry red card in the Nou Camp. Ramires' strike on the cusp of the break gave the 10 men something to cling onto, setting the stage for that Fernando Torres goal.

Without Terry, Ramires and Ivanovic among others, while David Luiz and Gary Cahill held themselves together with sticking plasters, Bayern Munich looked like being too much for Chelsea, especially with the Allianz Arena behind them for the final. They nearly were but Drogba rose to the hour unforgettably, a team that were on the brink of a round of 16 exit crowned champions of Europe.

4. Ajax, 1994-95

In retrospect, a team that included Edgar Davids, Edwin van der Sar, Patrick Kluivert and Marc Overmars looks every inch a potential European champion but no one saw Louis van Gaal's men as potential European champions at the start of the 1994-95 season. Then came their impressive 2-0 win over reigning champions AC Milan on matchday one. From there they never looked back, beating Fabio Capello's side again on the road before blitzing Bayern Munich in the Olympisch Stadion, Jari Litmanen netting a brilliant brace.

They weren't quite the same underdogs for their third meeting with Milan that they had been for their first but still, theirs was a side that utilized seven academy graduates in Vienna. One of those, 18-year-old Patrick Kluivert, would net the winner on a night where a youthful Ajax showed a level of composure beyond even their more garlanded opponents.

3. Monaco and 2. Porto, 2003-04

This was the year where all the big teams rather blew each other up, though Monaco and Porto certainly offered a helping hand to those who got within reach of them on their path to Gelsenkirchen. Lyon's fine form in the group stages forced Bayern Munich into second place and a draw with Real Madrid while the awe-inspiring forward line of Inter were caught in Arsenal's comeback from the death, crashing into the UEFA Cup. What would go on to be The Invincibles probably should have gone on to win this competition but were sent crashing out on away goals by an inferior Chelsea who would be blown away by the devastating attacking tandem of Dado Prso and Fernando Morientes. He had already done for the hopes of his parent club Real Madrid in the quarterfinals in a year where away goals played an outsized role.

Eventual champions Porto will forever be remembered for Jose Mourinho's hurtling across the Old Trafford touchline after Costinha's late goal earned them a 3-2 aggregate win over another of the leading lights in the competition, Manchester United. Had AC Milan not blown a three-goal lead against Deportivo La Coruna in the quarterfinals then Kaka and company would surely have tasted glory but instead Porto got the more negotiable semifinal opponent. The fourth and so far last European Cup final not to feature a representative from England, Spain, Italy or Germany was ultimately a walkover for Porto, inspired by Deco on their way to a 3-0 win.

1. Borussia Dortmund, 2023-24

Recency bias? You betcha. Then again, the simple reality is that the 20 years since Monaco and Porto played out that underdog final have seen the richest clubs entrench themselves at the top table. The last quarter century has produced just two new winners of the Champions League: one the plaything of a Russian oligarch, the other a soft power vehicle for Abu Dhabi. Borussia Dortmund have proven to be rich pickings for those wealthier than them, invariably struggling to repeat the brilliance of the early 2010s when someone richer than them prises away, among others: Robert Lewandowski, Ilkay Gundogan, Ousmane Dembele, Jadon Sancho, Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham.

As for this season, six of their 12 games to get to Wembley have seen them pitted against clubs backed by Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds. A Dortmund side that have looked pretty ordinary in the Bundesliga quelled first Newcastle and then Paris Saint-Germain, who might have gotten the better of them in the group stage but froze in the semifinals. The rest of the fixtures weren't that easy either but Edin Terzic's men found their way past AC Milan, a frisky and fearless PSV Eindhoven and then Atletico Madrid just as the draw seemed to be opening up for Diego Simeone's side.

Dortmund were the side everyone wanted in the last eight and a fair few would have taken in the last 16 too. No wonder. They've given up an average of 1.7 non-penalty expected goals (npxG) per game while creating shots worth just 1.2 npxG. But for the brilliance of Mats Hummels and Gregor Kobel, this team of somewhat promising youngsters and second-timers at the Westfalenstadion wouldn't have gotten close to the final. It's not far short of a miracle that they have. It's certainly enough to make you believe they're going to go one step further.",cbssports.com,news,CBS Sports,James Benge,0.3019607843137255,452820387,1,https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/07/d9c28290-22fa-4ac3-97ab-00df8bd88db9/thumbnail/1200x675/976902863e26ce71fd1bdaf0b223c116/bvb-1.jpg,

The Euros are very nearly upon us - and 24 men are tasked with taking their team as far as they can at this summer's huge tournament in Germany.

From long-serving bosses to relative newcomers, these are the managers who will call the shots during Euro 2024.

Let's dive straight in!

Capped 84 times by Yugoslavia in his playing days, Dragan Stojkovic took over as Serbia manager in 2021, leading them to qualification for the 2022 World Cup.

The former Red Star Belgrade and Marseille midfielder had previously managed exclusively in the Far East, taking charge of Nagoya Grampus and Guangzhou R&F in Japan and China respectively.

Appointed at the start of this year, Ivan Hasek took charge of a Czech Republic team who had already secured qualification for the Euros under predecessor Jaroslav Silhavy.

A regular for Czechoslovakia during the late 80s and early 90s, Hasek was previously boss of the Lebanon national team and has also managed clubs in France and Saudi Arabia, among other countries.

Another relatively recent appointment, Michal Probierz replaced Fernando Santos as Poland manager last September and steered them to the Euro 2024 play-offs.

There, the former boss of the Polish U21 side oversaw a 5-1 thrashing of Estonia in the semis and a dramatic penalty shootout win over Wales in the final to seal qualidication.

A former Swiss international, Murat Yakin succeeded Vladimir Petkovic as Switzerland manager after Euro 2020.

The ex-Basel centre-back - who played at Euro 2004 alongside his brother Hakan - guided his nation to qualification for Euro 2024 as runners-up in their group, having coached them to the last 16 of the 2022 World Cup.

A two-time Slovenian title winner as manager of hometown club Maribor, Matjaz Kek was appointed national team boss in 2018 - having previously held the position between 2007 and 2011.

Under his stewardship, Slovenia finished as runners-up in their qualifying group to reach their first major tournament since the 2010 World Cup - and their first Euros since 2000.

Familiar to English football fans for his spells at Tottenham and West Ham, former Ukraine striker Serhiy Rebrov has managed his country since June last year.

The 49-year-old steered the war-torn nation - who have been playing their home games in Poland as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion - to Euro 2024 via the play-offs - where they staged dramatic comeback victories against Bosnia and Herzgovina in the semis and Iceland in the final.

Edward Iordanescu steered Romania to Euro 2024, the country's first major tournament since Euro 2016, in impressive fashion, with a record of six wins and four draws from their 10 qualifying matches.

The 45-year-old took charge of his nation in 2022, having previously coached CFR Cluj to the Romanian title.

Francesco Calzona actually has two manager's jobs: this one, and as head coach of Napoli - placing him in an unusual position in today's game.

The Italian was appointed Slovakia boss in 2022, taking on his first frontline managerial role, and led the Falcons to Euro 2024 qualification as Group J runners-up behind Portugal.

Appointed Austria manager in April 2022 - while still in interim charge at Manchester United - Ralf Rangnick steered his team to Euro 2024 qualification as runners-up to Belgium in Group F, winning six and losing only one of their eight games.

Having managed solely at club level until taking his current role, the pressing-loving German tactician is preparing for his first experience of international tournament football.

A Champions League winner with Bayern Munich and World Cup runner-up with France as a player, Willy Sagnol ensured legendary status in Georgia by leading the small Caucasian nation to their first ever major tournament.

Appointed in 2021, Sagnol and his troops secured a Euro 2024 berth by beating Luxembourg and Greece in the play-offs.

Vincenzo Montella took over as Turkey manager towards the end of the nation's Euro 2024 qualifying campaign and secured top spot in Group D ahead of Croatia and Wales.

The former Roma and Italy striker was given the job after a two-year stint in charge of Turkish Super Lig outfit Adana Demirspor - who he led to their best ever league finish and European qualification for the very first time.

It wasn't that long ago that Albania were relative minnows of European football - but they made their major tournament debut at Euro 2016, and they've gone from strength to strength since appointing Sylvinho as manager 18 months ago.

The former Arsenal, Barcelona and Brazil left-back oversaw the Balkan nation's impressive qualification for Euro 2024 as Group E winners ahead of the Czech Republic and Poland.

Back in the Netherlands hotseat for a second time - having left in 2020 to manage Barcelona - Ronald Koeman is one of his country's most legendary players.

And, Barca disaster aside, he's been among the top Dutch coaches of the modern era, winning major trophies with Ajax, PSV and Valencia - as well as doing an excellent job in the Premier League at Southampton.

He led the Oranje to Euro 2024 by finishing second to France in Group B of qualifying.

Scotland were not in a good place when Steve Clarke became manager in May 2019 - but the ex-Chelsea right-back and West Brom boss has transformed his country's footballing fortunes.

Clarke steered the Scots to Euro 2020 qualification via the play-offs - ending their 23-year absence from major tournaments - then guided them to Euro 2024 as Group A runners-up to Spain, who they memorably beat 2-0 at Hampden Park along the way.

Hungary manager since 2018, Italian Marco Rossi coached the Magyars at the previous Euros three years ago - where they were unfortunate not to get out of a group containing Portugal, France and Germany, holding the latter two to draws.

In his first tournament as manager, Kasper Hjulmand took Denmark to the semi-finals - where they pushed England all the way - galvanising his squad after the harrowing experience of Christian Eriksen's cardiac arrest during their opening game against Finland.

The 52-year-old couldn't repeat the feat at the 2022 World Cup - where the Danes made a group-stage exit - but he did guide his country to Euro 2024 as winners of their qualifying group.

Things didn't work out for Spain under Luis Enrique - so, following his resignation after La Roja's limp 2022 World Cup last-16 exit at the hands of Morocco, the three-time European champions moved to appoint Luis de la Fuente.

And it's been a case of so far so good under the man who previously coached the country's U19, U21 and U21 teams, with a much-needed more incisive brand of possession-based football being implemented.

A 2021/22 German Cup winner as boss of RB Leipzig, Domenico Tedesco was appointed Belgium manager for the start of Euro 2024 qualifying, following the Red Devils' disappointing 2022 World Cup group-stage exit under Roberto Martinez.

And their campaign couldn't have gone much better: Tedesco's team won six and drew two of their eight matches, scoring 22 goals in the process and topping their group.

Roberto Martinez wasn't out of a job for long after resigning as Belgium manager, being appointed by Portugal in January of last year.

Successor to Fernando Santos - under whom the Portuguese won Euro 2016 - the Spaniard - who guided Belgium to third place at the 2018 World Cup - oversaw an utterly dominant campaign in which Cristiano Ronaldo and co. won all 10 games, scoring 36 goals (including nine in an absolute evisceration of Luxembourg) and conceding just two.

The man behind Croatia's greatest tournament performance - finishing as runners-up at the 2018 World Cup - Zlatko Dalic is approaching seven years in charge.

His team went out in the last 16 of Euro 2020, but the consistency he's been able to achieve with a country whose population totals less than four million simply has to be commended.

Their superstar players like captain Luka Modric aren't getting any younger, but Croatia are never a team to be taken lightly under Dalic.

England's best manager since Alf Ramsey? There's certainly a strong case to be made for Gareth Southgate, the man who united the English national team like no one had been able to in decades, banished their penalty shootout hoodoo and took them to their first major final in 55 years (where they...let's not go there).

The Three Lions have got used to qualification being a doddle under Southgate, and so it proved again as went unbeaten in topping Group C ahead of reigning European champions Italy.

Now there's just one question: can he bring it home?

When Bayern Munich poached Julian Nagelsmann from RB Leipzig in 2021, they paid a world-record €25m to secure his services; that's the regard in which the German was held.

Despite flattering to deceive at Bayern (although he did guide them to the Bundesliga title), Nagelsmann is still rightly considered one of the best coaches in world football - and he's made a solid start to life as Germany boss, who brought him in to replace the sacked Hansi Flick last September.

As manager of the hosts, the pressure is on Nagelsmann - but that shouldn't be too heavy a burden for the man who won German Football Manager of the Year in 2017 at the age of just 30.

Italy won Euro 2020 under Roberto Mancini, but his shock resignation last year means that the Azzurri will be led in the defence of their crown by a different manager: Luciano Spalletti.

Appointed after steering Napoli to a runaway Serie A title success in 2022/23, the three-time Serie A Coach of the Year - who has also lifted major trophies with Roma and Zenit Saint Petersburg - is in his first international management job.

The attack-minded tactician has won five and drawn two of his eight matches in charge so far, with his side scoring 17 goals in the process.

France may have gone out of Euro 2020 in the last 16, but they're always one of the pre-tournament favourites with Didier Deschamps at the helm - and rightly so.

That was the only major tournament out of the last four where Les Bleus have not reached the final, and the 2018 World Cup winners came agonisingly close to retaining their title two years ago.

Captain of his country's 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000-winning team, Deschamps - who has been in the job for 12 years now - is one of just three people to have lifted the World Cup as a player and manager; can he become only the second, after Germany's Berti Vogts, to do the same at the Euros?",fourfourtwo.com,news,fourfourtwo.com,,0.2156862745098038,452768659,19,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VGRWKvRNepYgJS7MFeCViZ-1200-80.jpg,eng-9545726

Dutch wing-back Denzel Dumfries will put his fingers in his ears and shout 'la la la la la I can't hear you' if any mid-table Premier League sides come knocking for him this summer, according to reports from Italy.

We're a bit confused, then, that in the same breath, Gazzetta Dello Sport explain that's because Dumfries insists he wants to join mid-table Premier League side Manchester United should he leave champions Inter this summer.

They add that talks are ongoing over a new contract for Dumfries, who will be out of contract at San Siro next summer, and that his preference would actually be to remain at Inter.

However, a bid of something like £21.5m-£26m may tempt them to sell up amid claims of interest from several unnamed Premier League clubs.

Just to put a fourth stumbling block in the way of a potential deal, the Italian newspaper add that Dumfries' chances of making a move to Old Trafford may rest upon Erik ten Hag's continued presence at the club, which...yeah. Not so sure about that one.

Dumfries made the move to Inter from PSV in 2021, a move we can only assume was largely intended as a flick of the Vs to fierce rivals AC Milan to remind them of the time Dumfries-born Dominic Matteo scored against them in the Champions League for Leeds.

The 28 year old has 52 caps for the Netherlands and will be expecting to be going to the Euros this summer having claimed six assists for them in qualifying.

Gunvor International B.V. has executed a non-binding heads of agreement (HoA) to purchase liquefied natural gas (LNG) from LNEnergy Limited.

Gunvor will purchase approximately 44,000 metric tons of LNG per annum from LNEnergy at its planned small-scale LNG production facility at the Colle Santo gas field, located onshore Italy, according to an announcement by London-based investing company Reabold Resources Plc on the London Stock Exchange.

LNEnergy has the exclusive right to acquire a 90 percent interest in Colle Santo. Reabold owns a 26.1 percent equity interest in LNEnergy.

The contract term will be for an indefinite period with a minimum term of five years, according to the announcement.

The point of sale will be the truck loading flange at the small-scale LNG plant, and the LNG will then be delivered by truck in Italy. The price for the LNG will be aligned with the Italian PSV price.

The HoA provides for a potential prepayment by Gunvor for a portion of the first five years of deliveries, ""with such amounts subject to prepayment being a total of approximately 66,000 [metric tons] of LNG, or 999,000 MWh [megawatt-hours],"" Reabold said. The average forward Italian virtual exchange point (PSV) gas price for the years 2025-2030 is currently approximately $32.35 (EUR 30) per MWh. Reabold noted that the prepayment is conditional on agreeing definitive transaction documentation and LNEnergy obtaining the required permits to construct and operate the LNG production facility.

On the basis of the HoA, LNEnergy and Gunvor intend to negotiate a fully-termed LNG sale and purchase agreement over the next six months. During such time, LNEnergy will exclusively discuss the sale and purchase of LNG from Colle Santo with Gunvor, according to the announcement.

""We are delighted with this progress towards an extremely significant milestone for our LNG project at Colle Santo in Italy,"" Stephen Williams, Co-CEO of Reabold, said. ""The agreement envisages a counterparty of the highest quality potentially providing both offtake and a prepay, which is extremely valuable for the project in these times of capital scarcity in the industry"".

""In keeping with Reabold's broader strategy, Colle Santo has the potential to provide significant, reliable and low carbon energy into the Italian market, improving European energy security whilst contributing to an efficient energy transition,"" Williams added.

Reabold Resources has a diverse portfolio of gas assets composed of development, appraisal and exploration projects. Reabold is focused on its two key gas assets: West Newton onshore the United Kingdom and Colle Santo onshore Italy, according to its website.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.1607843137254903,452703569,46,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Gunvor-Inks-HoA-to-Buy-LNG-from-LNEnergy-176647-582x327.webp,

The 50 best managers in the world,"You already know most of the best managers in the world: they're the ones that have hands gripped around silver handles this time of year. But that doesn't tell the whole truth, does it?

Arsene Wenger once famously opined that, ""You're loved when you're born, you're loved when you die - and in between you have to manage."" It's a job in which you're battered by the press, by fans and by defeat: many managers will win fewer games than they'll ever draw or lose, after all. But sometimes, the best managers are those who simply... get on by.

So here's our list of the best in the world right now, from the greats of Guardiola to the midtables and the Moyes. Who gets your vote?

Into his 13th season in charge of Freiburg, Streich has, remarkably, only ever managed the German side - and this will be his last. Relegation in 2014/15 could've marked the end of his time in charge, but immediately winning 2.Bundesliga highlighted his quality to bounce straight back to the top tier.

Since then, Freiburg have been slowly progressing, finishing sixth and fifth in recent seasons. Reaching the final of the 2022 DFB-Pokal, which they lost on penalties to RB Leipzig, stands out on the 58-year-old's CV, too.

Initially something of a managerial trailblazer in 2000s English football, Martinez's possession-based style of play revitalised Swansea City, before he moved to Wigan and hoisted up the FA Cup. After three years at Everton, he turned to the international game, tasked with guiding Belgium's 'golden generation' to success.

A third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup and the top spot in the FIFA rankings were the high points of his six-year spell with the Red Devils, as his time ended with a group stage exit in the 2022 World Cup. The Spaniard is now preparing for his fourth major international tournament after landing the Portuguese national team job last year.

Ralf Rangnick was lined up for the Milan post instead while Stefano Pioli held the fort. What Pioli achieved - in his unbeaten run that gave him the full-time job, followed by Champions League qualification and a Scudetto later on - is the best anyone has done at I Rossoneri for quite some time.

He leaves not at his peak but with Milan fans yearning for a change, after watching Inter lift the Scudetto against them. But Pioli will be back, for sure - and hopefully has another remarkable story like this in him.

The 37-year-old is quite possibly the next big thing in English football. After seeing his playing career at Tottenham cut short by injury McKenna moved into coaching, initially with Spurs U18s before moving to Manchester United, working his way up through the youth set-up to the senior side.

Ipswich Town's decision to take a chance on a 35-year-old McKenna in December 2021 was an inspired decision as he earned promotion from League One in his first full season at Portman Road before this year's magnificent Championship season that has seen the Tractor Boys return to the Premier League, all done without big names and on a limited budget. Ipswich will be braced for interest from all quarters this summer.

When Frank Schmidt took charge of Heidenheim in 2007, they had just become an independent club and were sat in the fourth tier of German football. Fast forward 17 years, and Heidenheim are competing in the Bundesliga for the first time in their history - and they're going to stay up comfortably. What a job.

Currently the longest serving manager in German football, Schmidt has overseen three league titles - the most recent of which came last season in 2.Bundesliga in dramatic fashion, with two stoppage time goals against Jahn Regensburg moving them from play-off bound third to the top of the table.

Sergio Conceicao took the Porto job in 2017 following £100 milion of sales to satisfy Financial Fair Play. Conceicao grabbed the nettle - and beat Benfica to the title.

A reliability in Portuguese football, the Dragons have won three titles, every two years, under their current manager - all while playing a front-footed style of play amid plenty more sales, since Portuguese football is built on quicksand. They're due another title this season, according to schedule.

A managerial A-lister, Pochettino went back to school after his career as an Argentina international came to an end, before kicking off his coaching career at Espanyol. Tottenham came calling after an eye-catching spell at Southampton and over a five-year period he would lead Spurs to a second-place finish and a Champions League final appearance.

He finally got his hands on silverware during his 18-month stint at Paris Saint-Germain and now finds himself with the near-impossible job of trying to make order out of the chaos at Chelsea. While the Blues are heading for a modestly improved campaign under Poch this time out, speculation over the owners' itchy trigger finger remains.

The cliches are bedded in. Gareth Southgate is pragmatic, cautious and sometimes misses the obvious but just because he sometimes drops the ball, we often forget how good he is.

And that's being the most successful England manager in over half a century - and plenty of tried, plenty with talented players, too. Tactically, Southgate may lack but his man management is exemplary and his in-game nous has taken England to a semi-final and final in the last two tournaments. In Qatar, dare we say it, England were... free-flowing. Maybe he is evolving?

Peter Bosz has been all over Europe now, to mixed acclaim, managing Ajax, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and most recently Lyon. While he has a habit of picking difficult gigs (for one reason or another), he's found a stable base at PSV and got them ticking.

Set for a title against Arne Slot's Feyenoord isn't to be sniffed at either - even if it is in the absence of Bosz's former employers Ajax, who've spent some of the season languishing in the relegation zone. What an odd year it's been in the Netherlands.

The 65-year-old will be hoping he has given the Italy side their mojo back as his first international post sees him lead the Azzurri at Euro 2024, after they failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup under Roberto Mancini.

This is the 12th stop of the veteran coach's managerial career which has seen him take charge of some of Italy's biggest clubs. A tactician and a motivator, Spalletti took over the Italy national team with his stock at an all-time high following his superb Serie A title win with Napoli in 2022/23.",fourfourtwo.com,news,fourfourtwo.com,"Ed McCambridge, Ryan Dabbs, Matthew Holt, Joe Mewis",0.3490196078431373,452690148,19,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MhRySSLi3PkXr9BEE8P3sX-1200-80.jpg,
