It is hard not to feel like the Weimar Triangle - France, Germany, and Poland - has been overdone in the media recently.

It is probably safe to say that the overwhelming majority had never heard of this construct until leaders decided last year to dig it out from the closet of tried and failed post-Cold War ideas.

Suddenly, the Weimar approach is being hailed everywhere as the panacea for all evil that engulfs the three countries, including curing the long-suffering Franco-German friendship.

There is little, it seems, that the Weimar Triangle cannot do.

But even now, after having covered countless Weimar Triangle meetings, this reporter is struggling to find a catchy description that sums up what exactly it is.

Is it a forum, a diplomatic platform, a dialogue format, or an alliance?

Let's be honest - the simplest explanation is probably that whenever representatives of France, Germany, and Poland meet, they call it a Weimar Triangle meeting.

Historically, it has hardly ever lived up to being more than that.

Befallen by 'End of History' euphoria, the three countries' foreign ministers had unveiled the format as a talk shop to integrate Eastern European countries into Western structures shortly after the Iron Curtain came down.

Since then, the Triangle's Wikipedia page reads like a protocol of leaders vowing to revive it every five years or so - ""No, for real this time"".

That is basically what happened again when Donald Tusk regained power in Poland last autumn.

Before that, the format had once more gone through one of those dormant periods between the regular 'grand revival' announcements, as Poland's previous hard-right government was - diplomatically speaking - not very interested in fraternising much with Germany.

But at the risk of being proven wrong, like everyone else who ever uttered this phrase - this time, it feels different.

That became clear last week when the Triangle's foreign ministers unveiled the Weimar Agenda, outlining a number of foreign and security policy measures they want to implement throughout the EU's next five-year mandate.

For context: Following the EU elections, the bloc's leaders must decide on the priorities for the next Commission in June.

More than ever, the tasks are daunting: preparing the EU for a possible Russian attack and playing catch-up with America and China. Meanwhile, Viktor Orbán is ready to make it all come crashing down, which appeared to unnerve even battle-hardened EU diplomats this week.

Against this backdrop, the Weimar meeting hinted that the three countries increasingly see the Triangle as the EU's own G7, an inner-circle club where three of the bloc's most important economies commit to implementing ideas when others are too slow.

""The Weimar Triangle is intended to be a think tank that provides impulses for Europe,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters at the meeting in Weimar.

Thinking one bold step ahead, another mothballed 1990s concept that was recently revived springs to mind: The idea of a multi-speed Europe, whereby a coalition of willing countries moves forward with integration, with others gradually following suit.

Merely creating a regularised and institutionalised format for the forum could already move the Triangle well in that direction.

Not only could this help tackle the EU's deadlock and provide a framework for how the bloc could enlarge with new members, which currently seem hardly ready to join.

It could also provide an insurance against the next round of disinterest in the Triangle among the three Weimar partners - just to ensure that it does not need life support again in a couple months.

Karankevich noted that only two months had passed since his previous meeting with Szijjártó in Sochi. ""During this time, Belarusian and Hungarian specialists have done a lot of work to promote bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation in areas of mutual interest,"" he said.

The meeting was preceded by bilateral talks between the foreign ministers and as well as a meeting of the Belarusian-Hungarian intergovernmental commission on economic cooperation, which they co-chair. Following the talks, the parties signed the protocol of the meeting of the intergovernmental commission; a programme of cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary for 2024-2025; a memorandum of understanding to deepen cooperation in nuclear energy between the Energy Ministry of Belarus and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary.

In addition, the Belarus Energy Ministry signed a roadmap for cooperation between the Belarus NPP and Hungary's Paks NPP. It defines the main areas of joint work of Belarusian and Hungarian nuclear specialists for 2024-2025, including personnel training, scheduled maintenance and radioactive waste management. The roadmap further developed a memorandum of understanding concluded in April 2023 between the Belarusian Energy Ministry and the Paks II NPP.

The Paks II project was launched in 2014 by an inter-governmental agreement between Hungary and Russia for two VVER-1200 reactors (units 5&6) to be supplied by Rosatom. The existing Paks NPP comprises four VVER-440 power units. Following life extension work it is assumed that they will operate until at least 2052-2057. Paks currently provides half of all generated and one third of the consumed electricity in Hungary.

The Belarus NPP comprises two VVER-1200 power units. Russia supported the project with a $10bn to cover 90% of the overall cost. Unit 1 began operation in 2021 and unit 2 in 2022. The plant will supply about 40% of the electricity needs of Belarus.

The road map was signed by Director General the Belarus NPP, Sergei Babovich; the Director General of Paks-II Gergely Jákli; and Deputy Chief Technical Officer at MVM Paks NPP, Pál Tóth.

Yury Shmakov, the First Deputy General Director and Chief Engineer of Belenergo said Belarusian and Hungarian specialists will share best practices both in the field of equipment operation and personnel training. ""Certain work has already been done, and we understand how we will move forward to show that the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes is very important for the whole world,"" he said.

In turn, Gergely Jákli stressed that Paks II, as a NPP under construction, was interested in attracting Belarusian builders to work on the site. Relevant opportunities are currently being developed. ""The construction experience of Belarus is of great importance and highly valued by us, we are most interested in its study,"" he stated. Sergei Babovich noted that the Belarus NPP had made it possible to significantly change the country's economy.

During his visit to Minsk, Szijjártó noted: ""Our determination and our point of view are unequivocal: [Hungary is ready to co-operate] in all areas that are not subject to sanctions. Hungary is interested in developing liaisons, and we will provide any support for this. We are talking about it openly, hiding nothing. Hungary will not support the EU decisions that negatively affect the national interests of the country, its economy and that will produce a negative effect on the development of contacts with Belarus.""

He wrote on his Facebook page: ""Sanctions do not work. That is why our position is clear: less sanctions, more cooperation! Now we will increase economic cooperation with Belarus in areas not affected by sanctions. At today's meeting of the Joint Economic Committee, we will sign our agreement on nuclear cooperation and also carry out 92 inter-company meetings.""",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.3176470588235294,454853389,32,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/05/Hungary-Belarus_Cooperation.jpg,eng-9608662

The UN resolution on the genocide in Srebrenica caused strong reactions in the Balkans. The resolution designated July 11 as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica. The resolution, proposed by Germany and Rwanda - two countries also scarred by genocide in the 20th century, was voted with 84 votes ""for"", 19 - ""against"" and 68 - ""abstentions"". Among the countries that voted ""against"" were Belarus, China, Cuba, Hungary, Russia and Serbia. The document sparked protests in Serbia, Republika Srpska and Montenegro. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Elmedin Konaković, described the resolution as a ""victory of the truth"". The relatives of the victims of the massacre in Srebrenica welcomed the resolution without mass demonstrations, BNT reports. July 11 will mark 29 years since the entry of Serbian units under the command of General Ratko Mladić into the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica after several attacks by Muslim formations on Serbs. During the operation in 1995, more than 8 thousand Muslim men and boys were massacred.

18 victims of the Nazis identified in Greece 83 years after their death

Eighteen civilians who were executed on the Greek island of Crete during World War II have been identified 83 years later through DNA analysis at a laboratory of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology in Greece, the Greek newspaper ""Kathimerini"" reported. The men between 16 and 60 years of age from the village of Adele were executed on 2 June 1941 after the Battle of Crete by soldiers of the Third Reich. The scientific leader of the first-of-its-kind study in Greece, Nikos Poulakakis, says that the Nazis gave the victims shovels and their relatives thought they were being taken to a concentration camp. However, they were taken to the Sarakina area and forced to dig the pit that was to become their mass grave. Their relatives managed to find the remains of the victims a few days later and moved them to another grave. In 1960, the remains were exhumed, but at that time it was not possible to identify them. ""Kathimerini"" writes that from June to August 1941, soldiers of the Third Reich massacred about 2,000 people on the island.

Candidates aged 23 to 100 to compete in the elections in Romania

In Romania, on June 9 this year, more than 207,000 candidates will compete in the local elections and 494 - for European Parliament, BTA has reported. The youngest candidate is 23 years old and the oldest one is 100 years old. 18,955 polling stations will be opened in the country, while 915 polling stations will open abroad in comparison to 450 in the previous European elections in 2019. Most of them will be in the countries, which have the largest number of Romanian citizens. In Italy, the sections will be 150, in Great Britain - 147, in Germany - 104, in France - 66, in Moldova - 52, in the USA - 48. Election day in Romania will start at 7:00 a.m. and ends at 10:00 p.m. o'clock, but if there are people waiting to vote, it can be extended until 11:59 p.m.

Serbia has started construction of its most powerful solar plant

Israeli company Nofar Energy has started the construction of the largest solar power plant in Serbia with a capacity of 26 megawatts. The investment near the city of Senta on an area of 30 hectares, is worth 25 million euros with an expected annual electricity production approximately covering the needs of more than 9,000 households. The facility would be connected to the country's electricity grid by the end of the year, the ""Tanjug"" agency reports. It is expected to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 25,000 tonnes.

Turkey to combat unprecedented decline in birth rate

According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (Türkstat), in 2001 there were an average of 2.38 births per woman in Turkey but in 2023 the number dropped to an average of 1.51 live births per woman of childbearing age. In an effort to find out the reasons and deal with the unprecedented decline in birth rate, the Ministry of Family and Social Services has started an initiative to conduct special surveys in the cities of Karabük, Zonguldak and Bartın, where the birth rate is the lowest, as well as in Izmir, Antalya and Karaman, where the divorce rate is high. Based on the results, an action plan will be drawn up for these regions. Among the measures considered to stimulate births among couples is a proposal to extend maternity leave from four months to one year.Compiled by: Miglena Ivanova

Between 6-9 June, around 360 million people across the EU will vote for representatives from national parties to sit in the European Parliament.

The grouping or coalition with the most seats will help to shape the leadership of the next European Commission. The overall composition of parliament will also influence the bloc's priorities between 2024-2029.

Climate change and energy once again feature prominently in the manifestos of the major parties, with mounting pressure to secure energy supplies in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine drawing particular focus.

Core to this is a transition to decarbonised domestic energy. Carbon Brief's analysis shows that the relatively small nations of Portugal, Latvia and Finland have led the way since the last EU election, with the largest percentage drop in power-sector emissions between 2019 and 2023.

Malta and the Netherlands have led in increasing their renewables shares, with the Netherlands also seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation.

Meanwhile, fossil-fuel generation fell in all but three countries when comparing 2019 and 2023.

Other key findings from the analysis include:

In this analysis, Carbon Brief looks at how the electricity sector has changed since the last election.

Every national power system across the EU has become cleaner since the last European Parliamentary election in 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

Finland led the way in terms of reducing grid intensity - the measure of how clean the electricity within national grids is - halving its intensity between 2019 and 2023 to become the third cleanest in the EU, behind France and Sweden.

In absolute terms, Greece reduced its grid intensity the most since 2019, Carbon Brief shows. The country hit a new record high level of clean energy generation, with power grid operator IPTO announcing that renewables and hydroelectric plants accounted for 57% of the country' energy in 2023.

Germany saw the largest fall in power-sector emissions in absolute terms - namely, the overall volume of CO2 emissions produced. Like Greece, the country had a ""landmark"" 2023 for renewable generation, according to thinktank Ember.

Carbon Brief analysis shows that power-sector emissions in Germany fell by 43.23m tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), or 18.4%, of 2019 values by 2023.

Despite this significant drop, the country's power sector is still the most polluting of all EU countries, responsible for 29.3% of EU power-sector emissions. This places it far ahead of Poland, the second largest polluter, which is responsible for 17% of emissions.

Germany has one of the largest populations in Europe and its energy demand sits at 514TWh (19% of EU total). When looking at per-capita emissions (as shown below), the country sits fourth in the EU for emissions, seeing a reduction of 0.51tCO2 in 2023 compared with 2019.

Portugal, Latvia and Finland decarbonised their power sectors the most relative to 2019, analysis shows.

Portugal saw renewables supply 61% of its electricity consumption in 2023, according to the country's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais. This totaled 31.2TWh - the most it has ever recorded. This included a period in November where the country ran on just renewables for six days in a row.

Carbon Brief's analysis of Ember data placed the 2023 figure even high, with 73% of electricity from renewable sources.

As shown in the chart below, there were just three EU countries where power-sector emissions have increased since 2019 - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania. These countries are some of the smallest in Europe, collectively accounting for less than 1% of total EU power generation in 2023.

Malta increased its power-sector emissions by 0.11MtCO2, or 10.3%, of 2019 emissions. As an island nation, Malta's energy system is still heavily dominated by imported oil and gas, making up nearly 90% of power generation. (Malta has some of the lowest per-capita emissions in Europe, with 5.3 tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per inhabitant in 2019, well below the EU average of 8.4tCO2e.)

Croatia, where emissions increased by 0.4MtCO2 or 13%, is similarly reliant on fossil fuels, with coal still dominating its power sector. While power demand has remained stable in recent years, net imports of electricity have dropped likely due to higher electricity prices in neighbouring countries.

Although renewable generation offset most of this, it did lead to a small jump in fossil fuel use of ~1TWh.

Lithuania saw emissions increase by 0.32MtCO2, from 0.57MtCO2 in 2019 to 0.89MtCO2 in 2023, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country is currently heavily reliant on electricity imports, after the closure of its only nuclear power plant in 2010 changed it from a net exporter to a net importer.

Chris Rosslowe, senior energy and climate data analyst at Ember, tells Carbon Brief:

""Trends in generation in Lithuania don't tell you as much as in other countries as it imports most of its electricity since shutting down nuclear power in 2010. Import dependence is slowly lowering though - from ~75% in 2019 to ~55% in 2023 - and, like Croatia, renewables are growing faster than fossils.""

It is undergoing a particularly key period of transition. Lithuania's electricity grid currently operates synchronously with the Russia-Belarus power system, but it is planning to de-synch by 2025 and instead run with the continental Europe grid.

Additionally, it is among the countries that are seeing the fastest expansion of wind generation. It is also targeting halving its imports and generating 70% of its electricity from domestic sources by 2030, as it pushes for increased energy sovereignty and security.

Rosselowe notes that Malta, Croatia and Lithuania are all expected to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels in the coming years, offset in large part by growing renewables.

Overall, the Czech Republic remains the biggest per-capita emitter in the EU, as shown in the chart below. Between 2019 and 2023, emissions in the country did drop from 4tCO2 to 3.2tCO2, but it still sits 0.9tCO2 above the second highest per-capita emitter Cyprus (3.1tCO2).

The three countries that saw an increase in per-capita emissions match those where there was an increase in fossil fuel generation - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania.

Between 2019 and 2023, the share of renewable generation in the EU increased in all by one country, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Italy saw renewable generation fall from 115.83 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2019 to 114.8TWh in 2023. This was broadly due to the impact of droughts in the country affecting hydropower generation, which hit in 2022, but had a continued impact in 2023.

This was a wider dynamic seen globally, which kept the world from hitting peak electricity generation emissions in 2023.

Slovakia, meanwhile, was the only country to see a dip in its share of renewable energy when comparing 2019 and 2023. This was minor, falling just 0.65% from 23.57% to 22.92%. The country has one of the smallest energy demands in Europe and, like Italy, saw a drop in hydro driven by droughts in 2022.

Malta and the Netherlands saw their share of renewables increase by more than 150% in 2023 relative to 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

The Netherlands increased its absolute share of renewable generation by close to 30% since 2019, as shown in the chart below. The country seeing the largest absolute increase in renewable generation, closely followed by Spain.

Nearly half the electricity produced in the Netherlands is now renewable, according to the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics.

This was predominantly wind generation, with the country adding more wind power than any other country in the EU between 2019 and 2023, both relatively and in absolute terms. Overall, the Netherlands increased its wind generation by 152% and Finland followed closely behind with a 143% rise.

Latvia, similarly, saw significant growth, with the share of renewables jumping from 49.5% in 2019 to 76.6% in 2023. This 27.1% increase is particularly key for the country, as it continues to target reducing its dependence on energy imports from Russia.

Spain added more solar generation in absolute terms over the four-year period than any other country in the EU, tripling its overall renewable generation.

Poland increased its solar generation by more than 1,500%, increasing generation by 12TWh albeit from a low starting point of just 0.71TWh in 2019. Renewables generated a record 26% of electricity in the country in 2023. However, coal still produces most of the country's electricity and continues to have a powerful impact on policy due to powerful lobbies.

Hungary has increased its solar share of generation the most since 2019, with an increase of 14%. It was followed closely by the Netherlands, with a 12.8% increase. Luxembourg increased wind power share of generation by more than the Netherlands - 17%.

Overall, just three EU countries - Malta, Croatia and Lithuania - saw an increase in the share of fossil fuel generation in 2023 relative to 2019, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

Over the same period, Luxembourg and Finland reduced fossil generation by more than 60%.

The Netherlands has reduced its fossil fuel share in the electricity system the most since 2019, falling by close to 30%. As shown in the chart below, this fall was mirrored by a significant increase in renewable energy generation.

In comparison with 2019, Ireland saw an increase in coal generation in 2023 making it the only EU nation to do so. In 2019, coal generation was at a record low in the country (0.51TWh) before jumping to 2.72TWh in 2022 due to a drop in wind generation.

However, since that point coal power generation has been continuing to fall again, in line with the wider trend seen over the past few decades.

Ireland has seen total electricity demand increase by more than 60% since 2019, Carbon Brief analysis shows. The country's energy demand has been particularly driven by the growth of data centres, which accounted for 18% of energy demand in 2022, for example.

Despite the blip in coal generation, the share of fossil fuels fell by 2.5% between 2019 and 2023.

Portugal reduced its use of coal the most, relative to 2019, while Germany reduced the most in absolute terms. As discussed above, this was supported by surging renewable generation in both countries.

Pieter de Pous, programme lead in E3G's fossil fuel transition programme, tells Carbon Brief:

""Europe's phaseout of coal has been one of its biggest, most historical, monumental success stories of the last couple of years when you think about it. We've dropped consumption since 2016 by 50%, right? It's really enormous and it's a story that's rarely told.""

The last European Parliament elections saw a ""green wave"" of climate-focused politicians winning seats across the continent. In the years that followed, the EU approved a European Green Deal, including goals to cut emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.

European member states now have a ""critical role"" to play in implementing what has been agreed, notes Rosslowe. He adds:",carbonbrief.org,news,Carbon Brief,,0.1764705882352942,454852151,47,https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2RA0468.jpg,

Grids are high on the political agenda in Brussels as power consumption is expected to increase by 350% as the EU decarbonises. Until 2030, the European Commission sees the need for €600 billion in grid investments.

EU energy ministers signed up to a comprehensive declaration emphasising ""the need to roll out an EU Supergrid,"" explained Tinne Van der Straeten, Belgium's energy minister, after her final time chairing a meeting of Europe's energy ministers. Hungary takes over the EU Council presidency from Belgium on 1 July.

Deeper integration of European power grids could slash fuel use by 21% by 2030 and significantly reduce power price volatility, according to the Brussels think-tank Bruegel.

""Grids have saved us,"" explained Van der Straeten, recalling the 2022 energy crisis, when interconnections helped address supply disruptions and allowed power to flow between countries. She added that ""grids will be key and essential if we, as a Union, will become more resilient.""

Most of the work towards that goal hinges on planning.

To facilitate progress towards the ""Supergrid,"" EU ministers affirmed their commitment to ""long-term, coordinated electricity grid infrastructure planning at European level"" especially with a view to grid congestion.

While the EU's power and gas grid regulators already create regular ten-year plans, EU countries are looking to create plans looking 20 years ahead as well.

The incoming European Commission, to be formed after June's European elections, is urged to ""further strengthen the regional approach to electricity infrastructure planning and combine it with an EU-wide approach.""

To better serve future demand and avoid supply shortfalls, ministers also stressed the need for anticipatory investments - a riskier, speedier way of building infrastructure that is not immediately needed..

How much money is missing?

While the Commission has put a number on grid investment needs, no institution has yet put a figure on how large the gap is between currently planned investment and total needs.

The Commission should provide a figure, EU countries agree, calling for ""actual investment needs in relation to electricity grids compared to the funds earmarked for them"".

EU industrialists eye an €800 billion investment volume until 2030 - while energy think-tank Ember has found that more than 10 EU countries' grid plans do not account for recent influxes of renewables, which is liable to distort the figures.

Either way, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is called upon to ""strengthen financing and de-risking initiatives"" for grid investments in the future.",euractiv.com,news,EurActiv.com,,0.1686274509803922,454842790,10,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/12264694-800x450.jpg,

More deals for new Mercedes-Benz owners today.

Since 2022, Mercedes-Benz Malaysia has rolled out a diverse range of all-electric EQ products and today there's even more reasons to own one thanks to limited time offers.

Now you can get motor insurance support, a home wallbox, service packages and charging credits thrown in with your new Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle. You can even own your Mercedes-Benz all-electric vehicle with Agility+ payment plan to ensure the Guaranteed Future Value of your car and get up to a year of complimentary monthly repayments. Terms and conditions apply.

For any EV owner, battery lifespan is a major concern. Rest assured that Mercedes-Benz has partnered with CATL, the world's leading battery manufacturer to expand its global procurement of battery cells.

The new CATL plant in Hungary supplies CO₂ neutrally produced battery cells for Mercedes-Benz's European production sites. Not only are these batteries sustainably-produced, they're also built to last. To ensure customer peace of mind, they each come with up to 10-years warranty or up to 250,000 km, whichever comes first.

And if you really want to preserve your vehicle's battery health for many years to come, the steps are super simple. Just charge your battery in short bursts and set the vehicle to stop charging at 80% capacity.

You can charge your Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle at home using a wallbox, or out in public with AC or DC charging stations. Access to a free and comprehensive charging directory can be done via PlugShare, which can project onto any Mercedes-Benz EQ vehicle's infotainment display via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Just note that charging via DC rapid charging makes more sense when the battery is already at a low state-of-charge.

Charging up isn't something you have to do daily either. You can optimise energy use under the ""Range"" menu and adjust brake regeneration on the fly with paddle shifters. In our test drives of the Mercedes-Benz EQ vehicles, we found high brake regeneration worked best in urban areas while low regeneration kept the car 'coasting' without draining energy on the highway.

In Malaysia, Mercedes-Benz offers one of the largest portfolio of electric vehicles, including the large and upmarket EQE SUV, EQS SUV models, the limousine-like EQS and EQE, the versatile EQB, and the compact EQA.

The latest variants of the EQE and EQE SUV are exceptionally good value.

President Joe Biden's administration was close to completing talks on a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine, according to a US official, a move intended to cement longer-term support for Kyiv in its war against Russia's invasion.

OpenAI said it had cut off five covert influence operations in the past three months, including networks in Russia, China, Iran and Israel that accessed the ChatGPT-maker's artificial intelligence products to try to manipulate public opinion or shape political outcomes while obscuring their true identity.

Germany was providing as much as €500-million in additional military aid to Ukraine, including air defence missiles, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said.

""We will continue to support you in this defensive struggle,"" Pistorius said on Thursday during a visit to Odesa, Ukraine, to meet Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, German broadcaster ARD reported.

The package includes missiles for medium-range Iris-T SLM air defence systems and a smaller number of shorter-range SLS missiles, drones for reconnaissance and combat in the Black Sea and spare parts such as replacement tubes for artillery systems supplied by Germany and engines for Leopard battle tanks.

Some of the weapons were about to be delivered to Ukraine, Pistorius said.

While Ukraine's allies are stepping up efforts to send more air defence assets, the US and Germany have been cautious about delivering weaponry that can hit targets inside Russia. Pistorius said this month he wanted Germany to deliver another €3.8-billion in military aid to Ukraine this year.

President Joe Biden's administration was close to completing talks on a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine, according to a US official, a move intended to cement longer-term support for Kyiv in its war against Russia's invasion.

The agreement would see the US support Ukraine's defence and security along a wide range of capabilities, including air defences and drones, and ramp up efforts to build up the country's defence industrial base to allow for more production of artillery and ammunition.

The US official detailed the state of the talks on condition of anonymity. The Financial Times earlier reported the development.

The move comes at a critical time in the war with Russia building up troop formations near Ukraine's border and stepping up air attacks on the country. Ties between Washington and Kyiv have also been strained by Biden's decision to skip a summit next month to discuss Ukraine's blueprint for peace that is being organised by Switzerland.

While several G7 leaders plan to attend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on the leaders of China and the US to join. The White House has said the US will be represented in some capacity. Beijing has instead called for an international conference that would bring both Russia and Ukraine to the table.

Biden announced last year that the US and other Group of Seven nations would pursue bilateral security pacts with Ukraine and encouraged other allies to do the same. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this month during a visit to Ukraine said he believed the countries would be able to sign a 10-year accord in a ""matter of weeks"".

""These agreements send a clear message that Ukraine can count on its partners for sustainable, long-term support. That's not a matter to be debated from one year to the next -- nor is it a commitment by any one country,"" Blinken said.

OpenAI said it had cut off five covert influence operations in the past three months, including networks in Russia, China, Iran and Israel that accessed the ChatGPT-maker's artificial intelligence products to try to manipulate public opinion or shape political outcomes while obscuring their true identity.

The new report from the ChatGPT-maker comes at a time of widespread concern about the role of AI in global elections slated for this year. In its findings, OpenAI listed the ways in which influence networks used its tools to more efficiently deceive people, including using AI to generate text and images in larger volume and with fewer language errors than would have been possible by humans alone. However, the company said that ultimately, in its assessment, these campaigns failed to significantly increase their reach as a result of using OpenAI's services.

""Over the last year and a half there have been a lot of questions around what might happen if influence operations use generative AI,"" said Ben Nimmo, principal investigator on OpenAI's Intelligence and Investigations team, in a press briefing on Wednesday. ""With this report, we really want to start filling in some of the blanks.""

The company said it defined its targets as covert ""influence operations"" that were ""deceptive attempts to manipulate public opinion or influence political outcomes without revealing the true identity or intentions of the actors behind them"". The groups were different from disinformation networks, Nimmo said, as they could often promote factually correct information, but in a deceptive manner.

While propaganda networks have long used social media platforms, their use of generative AI tools is relatively new. OpenAI said that in all of the operations it identified, AI-generated material was used alongside more traditional formats, such as manually written texts or memes on major social media sites. In addition to using AI for generating images, text and social media bios, some influence networks also used OpenAI's products to increase their productivity by summarising articles or debugging code for bots.

The five networks identified by OpenAI included groups such as the pro-Russian ""Doppelganger,"" the pro-Chinese network ""Spamouflage"" and an Iranian operation known as the International Union of Virtual Media, or IUVM. OpenAI also flagged previously unknown networks that the startup says it identified for the first time coming from Russia and Israel.

French President Emmanuel Macron is set to host his US counterpart Joe Biden next week as the two leaders seek to step up cooperation on Ukraine.

Biden's first state visit to France will take place on 8 June and reciprocates Macron's trip to the US in 2022, the French presidency said. The two presidents will discuss the need for continued and unwavering support for Ukraine.

Days before the state visit, Biden is also due to attend the ceremony for the 80th anniversary of the battle of Normandy that led to the liberation of France and Europe in World War 2.

The meeting comes as European allies have grown increasingly concerned about what would happen if the US scales back its support for Ukraine, and how they could cover Ukraine's financial and military needs.

Biden's visit also comes a day before European elections, with Macron's centrist political alliance lagging far behind Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party in polls of voting intentions.

Sweden is looking at ways to unilaterally block imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) if Hungary stops or succeeds in watering down the European Union's proposed latest sanctions on Moscow.

EU member states are discussing sanctions targeting key Russian LNG projects, as well as a ban on using the bloc's ports to re-export supplies destined for third countries, as part of an effort to limit the Kremlin's ability to generate revenues from the fossil fuel. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has opposed the package and sanctions require the unanimity of the EU's 27 member states.

""If the sanctions package doesn't fit its purpose we are prepared to navigate on our own,"" Swedish Energy Minister Ebba Busch said in an interview on the sidelines of a meeting of ministers in Brussels. ""That's not optimal, but we are looking into the possibility of finding a way to further stop and put sanctions on Russian imports, specifically LNG.""

Busch didn't elaborate on how exactly the government would target energy imports from Russia, but said new measures that allow individual member states to effectively ban Russian LNG shipments without new sanctions were insufficient. The rules require countries to take into account the bloc's energy security, while nations like Spain have said that imports could simply be shifted to other EU countries.

Germany and the Czech Republic have called for the EU to set up a high-level working group on how to cut the remaining energy imports still coming from Russia after the dramatic reductions seen since the invasion of Ukraine.

While Sweden's imports of Russian gas are small, any measures would further signal member states' growing impatience over Hungary's continued obstacles on aid for Ukraine and sanctions, but also highlight disunity within the bloc.

""The aim of this whole war on Russia's side is to divide and conquer,"" Busch said. ""But Sweden will not wait if we don't succeed with the 14th sanctions package.""

Separately, Sweden is proposing to introduce broad EU import tariffs on Russian goods as soon as possible, with the proceeds going toward supporting Ukraine, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. Other countries like the US, UK and Canada have already introduced similar measures.

A senior Czech official urged allies to step up financing for an initiative aimed at delivering ammunition to Ukraine, saying only a quarter of those who made commitments had come through on financing.

More than three months after Czech President Petr Pavel publicised the effort to procure some 800,000 shells from sources outside the European Union, Tomas Kopecny, the Czech envoy overseeing the initiative, said only five countries had finalised payments so far.

""It's taking longer than we expected,"" Kopecny told reporters in Prague, where Nato foreign ministers were gathering to discuss aid in preparation for the alliance's summit in July in Washington. ""The main reason is the speed of the processes in different countries -- and the political will.""

The official warned that the pace needed to pick up, because the procurement process to arm Ukraine was competing with Russian efforts to tap a global supply of ammunition that Kopecny estimated at a ""single-digit million"" level. The 800,000 figure is a benchmark set by Pavel, but if resources are focused, Ukraine's allies could source as many as two million shells, he said.

Only one of the EU's big countries, Germany, had come through with funding of almost €600-million, Kopecny said. Ten other countries are going through domestic procedures to approve payments, whether through parliamentary passage or budget processes, he said.

Kopecny said Kyiv has been receiving stocks of ammunition for months -- and that the influx would ""multiply"" as of next month. He cited ""trustworthy commitments"" for some 500,000 shells, worth about €1.7-billion.

Moldova and Ukraine reached an informal agreement to keep natural gas flowing to the pro-Russian enclave of Transnistria after a transit contract with Gazprom expires at the end of the year.

Under the preliminary deal, a new route via Turkey is a viable option for getting Russian gas to Transnistria, the separatist region in eastern Moldova on the border of Ukraine, Moldovan Energy Minister Victor Parlicov said in an interview. Ukraine is closing its territory to Russian gas transit on 1 January 2025.

The arrangement comes as energy traders are watching how the end of Russian gas flows through Ukraine will affect Europe next winter. Allowing supplies to Transnistria may provide some encouragement that Ukraine transit deals with other countries might still be possible.

Ukraine's gas network operator in April rejected the renewal of interconnector agreements that would allow Russian gas to transit through the main cross-border point, Sudzha, next year. In the Moldova-Ukraine agreement, Gazprom could deliver the gas to Turkey and then via Bulgaria and Romania, but it would still have to go through Ukraine because of the design of the pipeline.

After the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Moldova gave up Russian gas, buying exclusively on the European market. But Gazprom continues to supply fuel to Transnistria, which provides Moldova with most of its electricity.

The European Union agreed to hike tariffs on imports of Russian grain to curb the Kremlin's revenues and prevent those shipments from destabilising the region's farm sector.

The tariffs, which also apply to Belarusian grain, will be in place from 1 July, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said on X. EU ministers also made the decision to tackle illegal Russian exports of stolen Ukraine grain into EU markets, he said.

These countries -- Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, and Serbia -- find themselves in what we have termed an ""arc of instability"" between Russia and the European Union.

This paper, a collaboration between two scholars from Carnegie Europe and one from Carnegie's Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, is the first of four looking at the issues facing these in-between states. It examines how Russia seeks to maintain influence and leverage in them, the weaknesses it seeks to exploit, and the changing narratives it uses to win the loyalty of swing voters and deter the West. The three subsequent publications will look in more detail at the situation in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova.

All of these in-between states are outside of the European Union and NATO, but are building stronger ties with the EU: several are prospective members of the union. They also maintain many connections with Russia, and are home to pro-Russian political forces and business interests. Many still buy Russian gas. Armenia is a member of two Russian-led institutions -- the Eurasian Economic Union and (for now, at least) the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) -- but is in the process of reevaluating the utility of membership in these organizations.

Since 2022, the EU and the United States have deployed substantial new political and economic resources to support these in-between states. The EU has relaunched its enlargement process, which had been stalled since 2013, and given candidate status to Moldova, Ukraine, and (more conditionally) Georgia -- something that would have been unthinkable a little more than two years ago. It has set up the European Union Mission in Armenia (EUMA) to monitor the border, the first such mission in a country that is a member of the Russia-led CSTO. Moldova is being weaned off of its dependence on Russian gas.

Still, it would be complacent to assume that the European trajectory of these in-between countries is a given. The enlargement process still has a long way to go before the candidate countries achieve actual membership, leaving skeptical EU governments with many opportunities to exercise vetoes. Public opinion in the in-between countries is growing more pro-European, but societies are still divided. In all these countries, a large section of the population says they want good relations with both Russia and the countries of the European Union. In Serbia, for example, 51 percent of people want to be on good terms with both Russia and the EU (13 percent are pro-Western but want to maintain ties with Moscow, while 38 percent want Russia and the West to be given equal treatment), according to a 2022 poll by the International Republican Institute (IRI).

What path these countries take will be largely determined by developments beyond their control -- in particular, the course of the war in Ukraine and complex intra-EU discussions about the future of the European project. If Russia is even partly successful in its war of aggression in Ukraine, destabilization or military action against its other neighbors cannot be ruled out. Conversely, Ukrainian military success against Russia and an accelerated path toward EU accession for Ukraine increases the European prospects of other states.

Geography matters. The states of the Western Balkans are surrounded by EU countries, which necessarily limits Russia's political ambitions there -- even as disillusionment with the EU over the slow pace of enlargement gives Russia leverage. The same cannot be said for Moldova, less still for Georgia and Armenia. Georgia's border with Russia and three-decade-long conflicts over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, recognized as independent by Moscow in 2008, make it vulnerable to any shifts in Russia's war with Ukraine. It is likely this sense of vulnerability that drives the Georgian Dream government's soft rapprochement with Russia on many issues since 2022.

When it comes to Armenia and Moldova, geography is nothing less than critical. There are many similarities in their political profiles: both countries are small and poor by European standards, and both currently have pro-European governments and large societal constituencies that are still close to Russia. Armenia, however, is far from the EU, sandwiched between Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and Türkiye (and has no diplomatic relations with Azerbaijan and Türkiye). Russia is still by default its main security and energy provider -- a dependence that the Armenian government is signaling it wants to begin to break. Moldova's two neighbors, by contrast, are Romania -- a friendly EU country -- and Ukraine, a fellow candidate for joining the union. The support of both neighbors has allowed Moldova to make the EU rather than Russia its main gas supplier since 2022, and to begin accession negotiations with Brussels without suffering (so far) a major backlash from Russia.

Workers from both Armenia and Moldova go abroad to seek employment and send home remittances. Again, there is a sharp contrast in their choices. Moldovan passport holders (including in the breakaway territory of Transnistria) enjoy visa-free travel to the EU, and many Moldovans now have Romanian passports as well, meaning that they can find employment in Europe, which in turn exacerbates the country's brain drain. By contrast, as many as 300,000 Armenians still work in Russia, although many have returned home since 2022.

In addition to the war in Ukraine, for which 2024 will be a critical year, the medium-term future of Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova will be determined by three other geopolitical factors in which the EU and Russia will play a role: the countries' domestic security concerns,the choices and decisions made by political leaders, and how successfully and rapidly the EU's revamped enlargement policy proceeds.

The most public manifestation of the confrontation between Russia and the West in the in-between countries is in the realm of ideas. Since 2022, Moscow has changed its messaging. Today's weakened Russia puts less emphasis on its role as security patron and energy provider and more on an ideological message: that it provides an alternative pole to the West and in particular to the ""global hegemon"" of the United States, which is portrayed as the puppet master of unwilling European countries.

To that end, Russian President Vladimir Putin has appropriated Western vocabulary about ""values,"" ""choice,"" and especially ""sovereignty"" to boost Russia's alternative vision. In a speech to the World Russian People's Council on November 28, 2023, Putin said:

We are now fighting not just for Russia's freedom, but for the freedom of the whole world. We can frankly say that the dictatorship of one hegemon is becoming decrepit. We see it, and everyone sees it now. It is getting out of control and is simply dangerous for others. This is now clear to the global majority. But again, it is our country that is now at the forefront of building a fairer world order. And I would like to stress this: without a sovereign and strong Russia, no lasting and stable international system is possible.

In the fight for the hearts and minds of people in Eastern Europe, the Russian leadership rarely claims that it is more prosperous than the West. Rather, it concentrates on criticizing two key aspects of the West. The first is Western countries' alleged double standards and inability to live up to their lofty rhetoric; the second is their moral decadence.

A stress on ""traditional values"" and on gender and LGBTQ issues in particular is designed to enlist the support of conservative constituencies in Eastern Europe for Russia. The traditionalist agenda requires zero effort from its supporters, but allows them to consider themselves morally superior simply because they do not belong to the LGBTQ community.

The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), which has strongly supported Russia's war in Ukraine, is a key ally in propagating this message. Several Orthodox churches in Eastern Europe are either directly affiliated with or have close relations with the ROC, allowing Moscow to bypass governments and local media to spread a pro-Russia message in hundreds of parishes.

In Moldova, for example, despite the government's pro-Western stance, around 90 percent of Orthodox believers belong to the Moldovan Orthodox Church, which is in communion with the ROC. Even though dozens of priests have switched their allegiance since 2022 to the Romanian-language Metropolis of Bessarabia, which is part of the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Moldovan Orthodox Church leadership has been equivocal about the war in Ukraine and many of its leading priests are strongly pro-Russian.

The Georgian Orthodox Church is also closer to Russia than much of the general public and has taken a relatively soft position on the war, trying to maintain relations with both the Moscow Patriarchate and the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. By contrast, Armenia's national church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, is an Oriental Orthodox Church not affiliated with either the Russian or Ukrainian churches. It shares an agenda of ""traditional values,"" but not Russia's geopolitical agenda regarding Ukraine.

Russia and the EU are courting both core constituencies in the in-between states and those who might be called swing voters: the many people who are not firmly committed to either a Western or an Eastern trajectory for their country. In all these countries, the political situation is highly volatile. Moscow clearly believes that even in countries that have made a formal commitment to EU membership, the game is not lost.

This means that Russia will work hard to support political forces with a pro-Moscow orientation in elections, such as the upcoming presidential and parliamentary votes in Moldova. Despite the official ban on Russian state media broadcasting there, Moscow still manages to reach a wide audience by using the local networks of the pro-Russian Gagauzia autonomous region, as well as social media. In its propaganda, the Kremlin portrays Moldova's integration with the EU as a smokescreen for the country's absorption by Romania and promotes anti-LGBTQ narratives presented as ""traditional values."" The latter resonate with the public especially well because they are supported by the Moldovan Orthodox Church and pander to deep-seated prejudices in Moldovan society: in opinion polls, over 70 percent of Moldovans say they would not accept an LGBTQ person as their neighbor.

In Serbia, a hybrid authoritarian-democratic government professes that EU membership is its strategic goal but declines to align with Western sanctions against Russia. It still courts Russian diplomatic support in fighting Kosovo's independence while routinely voting against Moscow at the UN General Assembly. A similar situation is unfolding in Georgia, where the ruling Georgian Dream party has formally promoted EU accession while expanding various forms of cooperation with Russia. In the weak democracies of Moldova and Armenia, pro-European governing parties contend with opposition parties that want to tilt the country back toward Russia.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the geopolitical orientation division runs along ethnic lines. Bosnian Serb leader of the Republika Srpska (RS) province Milorad Dodik's policies vis-à-vis Russia -- such as refusing to join in sanctioning Russia and maintaining close relations with the country -- enjoy support among his constituents. According to an IRI survey from 2022, 89 percent of Serbs in Bosnia have a favorable view of Russia, compared to only 27 percent of Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) and 39 percent of Bosnian Croats. According to a National Democratic Institute poll from 2021, 82 percent of Bosnian Serbs (mostly living in Serb-dominated RS) are against NATO membership, while 90 percent of Bosniaks and 92 percent of Bosnian Croats are in favor.

Public opinion in Moldova lags far behind the pace of international developments. According to a 2023 IRI poll, over half of Moldovans (52 percent) still believe Russia to be Moldova's most important economic partner. In a question on this issue, for which respondents could choose more than one answer, the EU got only slightly more: 68 percent. In reality, the EU overtook Russia in Moldova's foreign trade over two decades ago, and now trades over five times more with the country than Russia does.

This reality has prevented a major realignment in the country's domestic politics. Even though pro-EU President Maia Sandu is the most popular and most trusted politician in Moldova by a wide margin, with a positive rating of over 40 percent among decided voters, populist pro-Russian parties still fare quite well, with their combined support hovering around 40 percent.

In Armenia, meanwhile, public opinion has turned away from Russia -- the country's traditional main ally -- following Moscow's failure to act during Azerbaijan's seizure of the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia last fall. In an IRI opinion poll conducted in December 2023, when asked for their assessment of international partners, 89 percent of Armenians named the country's relationship with the United States as ""good"" or ""very good,"" and 87 percent said the same of the European Union. In contrast, only 31 percent had the same opinion of relations with Moscow, while 66 percent said the relationship with Russia was ""bad."" This marks a calamitous decline from October 2019, when 93 percent of respondents said the relationship with Russia was ""good"" and just 6 percent said it was ""bad.""

Still, 48 percent of Armenians said that Russia was the country's most important economic partner (it is indeed its biggest trading partner), and 31 percent said it was the country's most important security partner: a higher figure than for the EU, but lower than for the United States. In other words, Russia remains for many a patron of convenience and necessity, if not necessarily of choice.

In this context, it is important for Russia to broadcast the message that the West and Ukraine will not prevail in the war -- and that nonaligned European countries should be careful about investing fully in alliances with the EU and NATO.

Since 2022, the consensus among political elites and experts in the West has been that Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has strengthened Western solidarity and the two main Western alliances, the EU and NATO. The proof of this is the unanimous adoption and renewal of EU sanctions packages against Russia and the fact that EU enlargement has been relaunched -- something that was a very distant prospect prior to 2022. The Western narrative also holds that NATO has become more powerful after two previously neutral countries, Finland and Sweden, joined the alliance.

The Russian narrative is that this is an illusion. NATO is painted as an American hegemonic project imposed on unwilling Europeans, while the EU, also under American influence, allegedly works against the interests of its own population by opposing Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described U.S.-EU relations as ""the relationship of a suzerain and his vassals.""

The Kremlin constantly points to any evidence of cracks in the two Western alliances as evidence that the in-between countries should be careful about joining them. Hungary and Slovakia, for example, are portrayed as harbingers of change in the EU. In his December press conference, Putin praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán for his stand against other EU leaders over Ukraine, along with the recently elected prime minister of Slovakia, the populist Euroskeptic Robert Fico. These two leaders, Putin said, ""are defending their countries' interests. But there are too few politicians like this; I do not know why they do not exist. Maybe this has to do with Europe's excessive dependence on the Big Brother -- the United States.""

Russian officials frequently forecast disaster for the European Union. In December 2023, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov predicted that ""the EU will collapse"" under the burden of Ukraine's accession. Mikhail Sheremet, a parliamentarian from annexed Crimea, said that EU sanctions against Russia would destroy Europeans' prosperity and eventually the union itself. He said: ""With each package of sanctions, the leaders of European countries not only lose face and respect in front of the international community, but elicit annoyance and growing discontent in their own countries, leading the EU to its death.""

In the Western Balkans, a Euroskeptic message will always find its target. Russia tells these countries that they should be allowed to freely choose their international alignments (in contrast to Ukraine, which, according to Moscow, has no such choice). Russia accuses the EU and NATO of using empty promises of Euro-Atlantic integration to subdue the region's Orthodox nations and settle Balkan conflicts at their expense. The EU, Moscow insists, will make Serbia recognize Kosovo without granting any reciprocal concessions, and will turn North Macedonia into a semi-Albanian state. NATO membership is said to be wrong for Bosnia and Herzegovina as it will jeopardize peace. The EU is portrayed as weak and insincere in its promise to accept the Western Balkans into its ranks. And even if they were to join, Russia says the countries would be treated unfairly.

In May 2022, for example, Russia's ambassador to Sarajevo, Igor Kalabukhov, argued in a piece for Glas Srpske, an RS-published daily, that Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership in the ""institutionally and morally"" decadent EU would bring it no benefits and entail the loss of its sovereignty. His colleague Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, ambassador to Serbia, accused EU and U.S. mediators between Prishtina and Belgrade of a lack of fairness. He also condemned Western pressure on Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić. Most recently, Russia accused the West of destabilizing Serbia by inciting the protests that followed the country's controversial December 17 parliamentary elections.

The region's security architecture (or lack thereof) is still shaped by the legacy of the 1990s wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo. Almost all of the Balkan countries have now joined NATO, with the significant exceptions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Serbia. In Serbia, the memory of NATO's bombardment of Belgrade and other towns in 1999 and its role in facilitating Kosovo's independence also prevent the country from joining NATO, even though Belgrade has engaged in security cooperation with the United States.

The same legacy also fuels continuing pro-Russian sentiment among the Bosnian Serbs. Thanks to the ethno-federal structure sanctioned by the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian War, Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the countries where Russian influence is at its strongest in the region. The leadership in RS -- the Serb-majority entity that, alongside the Bosniak- and Croat-dominated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), makes up the country -- makes no secret of its close links to the Kremlin. Bosnia and Herzegovina has had a NATO membership action plan since 2018 but will struggle to join the alliance, as it could reignite the conflict with RS. The commitment to speeding up integration into NATO was dropped from the agenda of Bosnia and Herzegovina's state-level cabinet, which includes Dodik's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, the principal Serbian party.

With RS holding wide-ranging powers within the loose federation (powers that are constantly expanding, thanks to Dodik's brinkmanship), the entity can act as a quasi-state, pursuing its own external policies. In September 2022, Dodik met Putin in Moscow ahead of the Bosnian elections. Because of the RS veto, Bosnia and Herzegovina has not joined Western sanctions against Russia in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In addition, RS and its representatives can block decisions in central institutions such as the cabinet and the federal parliament.

Internally, Dodik has been playing an increasingly disruptive role. He has upgraded the RS police force with weaponry supplied by Russia, raising fears that an RS force separate from Bosnia and Herzegovina's integrated army could reconstitute itself. Dodik has repeatedly threatened to withdraw RS from state-level institutions, including the judiciary, the tax authority, and the military. Russia typically backs Dodik through the Peace Implementation Council. In addition, Russia has called for the abolition of the Office of the High Representative (OHR), which has historically contained Serbs' secessionist ambitions, notably through the so-called Bonn powers that allow the head of the OHR (who comes from an EU member state) to sack officials and impose legislation. Dodik has furthermore openly defied decisions by OHR head Christian Schmidt, and is now a defendant in a trial that he has dismissed as a political witch hunt. Although Russia is a key ally in these domestic squabbles, the Serb leader has other patrons, too -- notably Hungary, which has vetoed the imposition of EU sanctions.

Despite all this, the European Union maintains a gravitational pull. In December 2023, the European Council reconfirmed its commitment to authorize membership talks with Sarajevo, should certain conditions be met. Russia, however, is exploiting cynicism about the EU and resentment against the West (chiefly the United States) by focusing on the bitter legacy of the 1990s, on alleged Western double standards, and on the extremely slow pace of EU enlargement.

There are plenty of local grievances and conflicts to exploit. In 2018-2019, pro-Russian actors took key part in the demonstrations against the Prespa Agreement that resolved the decades-old name dispute between (North) Macedonia and Greece. In Serbia, the main anti-Western argument upon which Russia relies is the West's sponsorship of Kosovo's independence. The message is that the West works against national sovereignty. The Kosovo leadership, including Prime Minister Albin Kurti and President Vjosa Osmani, has repeatedly accused Russia of fomenting tension in the Serb-populated north, which has seen an uptick of violence over the past year. Following the shoot-out between Serb militants and the Kosovar police at the Banjska Monastery in September 2023, authorities in Prishtina said they were investigating a possible Russian connection.

Moscow's agenda is aimed at obstructing EU and U.S. efforts to integrate the region into the West, not at establishing Russia as a political, diplomatic, and economic hegemon, a feat that even the Soviet Union failed to accomplish in the early Cold War period. Russia therefore acts as a spoiler, seeing the Western Balkans as yet another arena in the competition with the United States and its allies.

Moldova is constitutionally neutral with no commitment to join NATO, unlike its two neighbors, NATO member Romania and aspirant NATO candidate Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, however, Moldova has found itself in a completely new international and security environment. Moscow's indiscriminate use of force just across the border and public statements that it intended to conquer vast territories -- and potentially attack Moldova as well -- changed the mood overnight.

The West's renewed interest in the region and the EU's eagerness to overcome its enlargement fatigue worked to the advantage of Moldova's governing party, the pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS). In less than two years, Moldova -- together with Ukraine -- managed to acquire EU candidate status and start formal talks on accession. These are achievements that in prewar times would likely have taken decades to complete at best. Moldova has also intensified its security cooperation with NATO, breaking a long-standing taboo based on fear of a Russian backlash.

Opinion polls suggest that the Moldovan public lags behind the government in perspectives on the war next door.Two years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as many as 30 percent of Moldovans said that Russia posed no threat to their country. Even many of those who opposed the Kremlin's intervention are in favor of accommodating Russia. In terms of national security, 58 percent of Moldovans believe that neutrality still offers the best protection for the country, while support for NATO accession has increased only marginally to 30 percent up from 20-25 percent in the prewar years. Support for EU membership is much stronger at around 60 percent, though the fear of provoking Russia is also tangible, with only 19 percent favoring the idea of quitting the Commonwealth of Independent States (the organization of former Soviet countries).

Even though the war has come dangerously close to Moldova's borders, so far it has failed to bring security issues to the forefront of public attention. In an August 2023 IRI poll, only 5 percent of Moldovans named war and conflict among their key concerns. The leading concerns were high prices (43 percent), corruption (27 percent), and low incomes (24 percent). Frustrated and disoriented by the socioeconomic difficulties exacerbated by the war, Moldovans are looking for easy explanations and solutions. According to a WatchDog.MD poll done in February 2023, over 40 percent of Moldovans deemed Russia a fascist state, while over 30 percent considered Ukraine to be run by fascists. Only around one third declared their readiness to defend their country in the event of a Russian invasion, and upward of 67 percent believed that President Maia Sandu should go to Moscow to negotiate a new gas contract. These findings suggest that economic problems largely eclipse security concerns for the majority of Moldovan society.

Russia is eager to take advantage of this confusion, and the war has made Moscow even less scrupulous in its methods. Over the past two years, the United States and EU have sanctioned a number of Russia-linked individuals for attempts to undermine Moldova's sovereignty, while Chisinau has expelled dozens of Russian diplomats for hostile actions. There is ample evidence that Moscow and its local proxies, led by the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, have been buying votes, staging anti-government protests, running disinformation campaigns, and spawning a plethora of new political parties to promote a pro-Russian agenda and sow confusion in the run-up to the autumn presidential election. Moscow views the upcoming vote as an opportunity to thwart Moldova's EU ambitions and bring pro-Russian forces back to power. The latter, despite being mired in numerous corruption scandals, still enjoy high support in Moldovan society, deftly capitalizing on socioeconomic difficulties.

Outside Ukraine itself, the most dramatic change in posture toward Russia in a post-Soviet country since 2022 has been in Armenia. For the past thirty years, Armenia's security concerns have centered on Azerbaijan and the future of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and its Armenian population. A military alliance with Russia first struck in 1996 and then renewed and extended in 2010 was seen as the best guarantee of Armenia's security and also of the status quo around Karabakh, which had been in Armenia's favor since the ceasefire of 1994.

Azerbaijan's victorious military campaign of 2020, followed by the war in Ukraine, put a strain on the Armenian-Russian alliance. Following an Azerbaijani military incursion into Armenian territory in September 2022, Armenia tried to trigger the security provisions of the Russia-led CSTO. Neither Russia, which also has a strong relationship with Azerbaijan, nor any other CSTO members came to Armenia's aid. Since then, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has publicly questioned the utility of Armenia's CSTO membership, and his officials have stopped attending CSTO meetings.

Anti-Russian sentiment in Armenia deepened further after Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh stood aside and allowed Azerbaijani forces to take the disputed region by force in its entirety in September 2023. Despite a forced exodus of the local Armenian population, Moscow did not criticize Azerbaijan for the takeover of Karabakh and instead lashed out at Pashinyan's government.

This is the context in which Armenian-Russian relations have soured rapidly and the Pashinyan government is looking to the West. Armenia is now turning to other partners beyond Russia to ensure its security. This means procuring weapons from France and India; accepting the EU civilian border-monitoring mission, EUMA, in southern Armenia against the objections of Azerbaijan; and hosting a (largely symbolic) U.S. military training exercise in September 2023. At the same time, Armenia seeks to strengthen its relationship with Georgia as a way of getting closer to the EU and increasing trade via the Black Sea with EU countries.

The EU can lay claim to being one of the most successful economic projects in history. Almost all countries that have joined it have become more prosperous, and this economic pull continues to attract neighboring states to aspire to join the union. This leaves Russia at a disadvantage and means that its pitch to its neighbors does not focus primarily on money. Russian foreign direct investment in all of these countries is minimal compared to the sums the EU and other countries such as China and Türkiye spend on major industrial and infrastructure projects.

Moscow's strategy is a different one. Having learned from the failure of Soviet propaganda, modern-day Russia rarely challenges the fact that people in the West enjoy higher living standards. It does, however, successfully cast doubt on the West's ability to extend its own prosperity to the societies of Eastern Europe. Russia revels in showcasing discrepancies between generous Western promises and the gloomy realities of Eastern Europe. These exposures are usually followed by offers of a bird in the hand instead of two in the bush.

Putin's own rhetoric about the impact of the Moldova-EU Association Agreement is a case in point. According to the Russian leader, ""Moldovan goods have almost lost their traditional place in Russia and have not gained a foothold in other markets."" Putin's claim that the deal has led to a decrease in bilateral trade between Moldova and the EU was false, but it helps illustrate the way Moscow frames its message to neighboring countries: the benefits of cooperation with Russia may appear more basic, but they are easier to grasp. Be it Moldova's fruit, Armenia's cognac, or Georgia's tourism industry,Russia's neighbors would do better to stick with less affluent but less choosy Russian customers, because they have no chance of succeeding in the EU. Essentially, Moscow tries to persuade the societies of Eastern Europe that they are not good enough to achieve affluence in the Western system.

Discounted gas has long been an instrument Russia has used to wield influence. As of 2021, Moldova was 100 percent reliant on Russian gas. The country suffered an energy crisis in 2022 after Russia drastically cut supplies and Ukraine also reduced its exports of electricity. Today Moldova has fully weaned itself off of Russian gas and is increasing electricity imports from its European neighbors to the west.

In December 2023, Putin openly lobbied Moldovans, claiming that their choice to receive gas from the West was political and would hurt consumers. He said:

Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries. Only recently, it was the poorest of them all. Today, Ukraine holds this title. But if one of Europe's poorest countries, which has been buying our energy resources at a price that was quite low, wants to follow in Germany's footsteps, go ahead. Today, Germany buys its energy resources from the United States and pays 30 percent more compared to what it imported from the Russian Federation. So, if they have some extra money to spend over in Moldova, let them go down this road.

The same message is being sent to Armenia, which currently pays Russia $165 per thousand cubic meters of gas, well below the market price in Europe.

A paradox of the Ukraine war is that even as Armenia's political and security relationship with Russia has deteriorated sharply, Armenia's economy has benefited from an influx of Russian migrants and Russia's need for trading partners. In 2023, Armenia-Russia trade volumes were worth more than $7.3 billion: a record number.

Russia uses sticks as well as carrots. In late 2023, Russia banned imports of agricultural produce from both Armenia and Moldova, supposedly on sanitary grounds. Farmers in both countries are heavily reliant on the Russian market. This followed a suspension of Armenian dairy exports in March 2023. Restrictions on the border crossing at Upper Lars in Georgia in the Caucasus mountains also hurt Armenian businesses that are reliant on this route to trade with Russia.

Russia has many opportunities to apply economic pressure tactics against Moldova and Armenia, just as it has done against Georgia in the past. However, the Kremlin must balance risky tactics such as cutting off gas exports or banning agricultural goods against the prospect that this will alienate the public in those countries and encourage their leaders to diversify their economies.

In 2006, Georgia and Moldova responded to a protracted Russian ban on wine exports by fundamentally restructuring and modernizing their wine industries. Even though Georgian wine eventually returned to the Russian market in 2013, it also expanded its inroads into other markets around the world, from China to Western Europe. While Russia is now once again the main export destination for Georgian wine, the country's ambitions would have been far narrower if Russia had not forced the issue.

Moldova is also diversifying its export markets. The EU overtook Russia as the country's leading export destination back in 2014, and that margin has gradually increased ever since. The war and the ensuing collapse of traditional transport routes dealt a final blow to Russia's status as a major market for Moldovan goods. In 2021-2023 export volumes halved, decreasing Russia's share in Moldova's exports to a negligible 3.5 percent. If sanctions against Russia are tightened or trade routes via Georgia shut down, Armenia may be forced to do the same and support for Russia among Armenia's traditionally Russian-oriented business community could fall.

Russia's ill-fated invasion of Ukraine has dealt a severe blow to its ability to project military and economic power in its neighborhood. A number of countries that are not members of either the EU or NATO, and that in the prewar years looked set to remain forever in a gray zone between Russia and the West, have suddenly found themselves much better positioned to make progress on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration and strengthen cooperation with both the EU and the United States. Many impediments remain, however, not least the unanimity principle in EU decisionmaking, which can still slow down or halt the accession prospects of candidate countries. In a country such as Armenia, whose government aspires to closer alignment with the West, European states face a more immediate problem: how to assist a government that is heavily reliant on Russian gas and wheat and that -- as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union -- is disqualified from pursuing a free trade agreement with the EU.

Moreover, even though pro-European sentiment has grown, societies in countries such as Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova are divided, and opinion polls suggest there are many ""swing voters"" who are receptive to the messages of both Russia and the West.

The Kremlin's appeal has never been limited to solely financial or military issues. Its ever- deepening confrontation with the West has pushed Moscow into creating more sophisticated and comprehensive messaging in its attempt to present its vision as a viable alternative to a Western-led international order. Russia is good at taking advantage of local conflicts, capitalizing on preexisting tensions, and recruiting the support of disgruntled segments of society.

Negative messaging about the West gets an especially sympathetic hearing in those segments, especially among Orthodox Christian believers, who regard themselves as adherents of ""traditional values"" and are skeptical of the liberal values promoted in Western countries. Russia also appeals to the economically disadvantaged, such as rural farmers and migrant workers who do not see immediate obvious economic benefits of European integration and are more used to selling their products to Russia than to EU countries or working there.

In three forthcoming papers, Carnegie scholars will map out the more specific and differing challenges facing Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova as they navigate relations with both Russia and the West. Despite their many differences, these three countries share a predicament in that their medium-term futures are highly dependent on the course of the war in Ukraine. In all these countries Moscow continues to send the message that its historic interest there is deep and long-term, and that the West can be an unreliable partner.",carnegieendowment.org,news,Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,,0.04313725490196085,454791071,7,https://carnegie-production-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/media/images/serbia-putin-new.jpg,eng-9612340

The remains of Ferdinand I (1861-1948; reigned 1887-1918) were moved from Coburg, Germany to the Bulgarian capital Sofia on Wednesday. The coffin was placed in the Royal Palace of Vrana on the outskirts of Sofia with special honours as national guardsmen lined up on both sides, the daily says.

The ceremony was attended by political figures, but President Rumen Radev and Prime Minister Diminar Glavchev were absent. Only some of the main political parties were represented at the event.

Historian Plamen Pavlov, who teaches at the University of Veliko Tarnovo, comments for Trud that it is not easy to make a straightforward assessment of King Ferdinand's reign, because too much negativism has amassed against him over more than a century. ""As head of state, he contributed a lot to the development of the nation, its modernization, the armed forces and the overall progress of society, which is beyond doubt. He was quite popular among the people,"" Pavlov says. Associate professor Lachezar Stoyanov of Sofia's New Bulgarian University says we should detach ourselves from ""the emotions of the past, the great disappointment after World War I, when Bulgaria suffered its second national catastrophe and Ferdinand was declared the main culprit"".

On the morning talk show of BNT1, the main channel of Bulgarian National Television, Metropolitan Antonii, who represents the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (BOC) in Western and Central Europe, says that the BOC appreciates Ferdinand's foresight in letting his son, the future King Boris III, become an Orthodox Christian. The decision cost Ferdinand a temporary expulsion from the Catholic Church.

POLITICS

The government plans to bar President Rumen Radev from representing Bulgaria at the Washington NATO Summit in early July, 24 Chasa has learned from a high-level government source. Both the head of state and the head of government are usually invited to such meetings, and it is up to the Council of Ministers to decide who gets to lead the national delegation. Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev is more likely to represent the country in the US capital, the daily predicts.

It recalls that Glavchev and Radev clashed this past weekend in connection with a Sofia meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Although the president is the supreme commander of the Bulgarian Armed Forces, he was not in Bulgaria at that time, visiting Budapest first, and then Switzerland, thus missing a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. From Hungary, in unison with the ideas of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Radev broached the subject of NATO countries possibly sending troops to Ukraine. Prime Minister Glavchev and other politicians reacted by saying that no one intends to deploy troops in the war-torn country.

The matter is also discussed in other media. SegaBG.com describes the controversy about who should go to Washington as ""a war of institutions"". It quotes Vice President Iliana Iotova as saying that the president has received a personal invitation to the summit. Iotova commented: ""Following the stance he took these days, I believe such voices should be heard."" The website expects that the matter will be resolved after the June 9 elections in Bulgaria. Given the very short time to elect a new regular government and prime minister in the period between the elections and the Washington Summit, the choice will most likely be between President Radev and the current caretaker Prime Minister Glavchev, SegaBG.com says.

A cable sent by Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev to Bulgaria's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Lachezara Stoeva shows that the caretaker government in Sofia exerted unprecedented pressure for a last-minute change of Bulgaria's geopolitical position ahead of a UN vote on a resolution on Srebrenica, Bird.bg says in a report, quoted in other media. Stoeva ignored Glavchev's instructions, and Bulgaria supported the resolution, which it had co-authored. This transpired from diplomatic documents accessed by the website staff. Quoting own sources, Bird.bg says the reversal in the government's position came after communication between Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and ex-Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borissov.

On May 23, the UN adopted a resolution designating July 11 as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica.

Russophiles often say that we in the Western world do not understand ""the boundless Russian soul"", that the Russians are a mystical unknown, law expert Petar Kichashki writes in Trud. Kichashki says the truth is that, first, ""the Russian soul"" is ""deeply irritated by the fact that we belong in the Western world"".

""Second,"" he says, ""we may or may not know Russia well, but they definitely don't know us. Russian society is deeply unfree, and with the war in Ukraine going on, it is also rather isolated. They are immersed in their own boiling cauldron and refuse to see the processes unfolding in the Western world. A most telling example of the failure of the Russian autocracy to understand freedom is the less-than-sensible argument of what they call 'the collective West'. Russia, they say, is at war with this imaginary collective West. Russia is locked in a dispute with it, in a war with it, and presents an alternative civilization to it. This is undoubtedly a lobotomized concept, but in addition to its being obviously less than sensible, there is something else. The very fact that Russia describes the free world as 'collective' clearly shows that it does not understand the nature of freedom and does not know what it is talking about.""

The analyst notes that both conservatism and liberalism are ideologies in the free world; theirs is a dispute between democratic and free people. Discussing the war in Ukraine, he argues that the fact that the free world is helping Ukraine does not mean that we are engaged in the war on a par with Kyiv.

""Three Years On, Laura Kovesi Is Bulgarized,"" caps an article about the European chief prosecutor published on SegaBG.com. The author notes that Bulgarians had expected the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) to intervene where the national authorities failed to do their job, uncover cases of large-scale fraud involving EU funds, take high-ranking Bulgarian officials to court, and possibly have them sent to jail. Nothing like this has happened, however, in the three years of the EPPO's existence. One of the reasons may be that the prosecutors working in Bulgaria on behalf of the EPPO are Bulgarians, and they observe the national procedural rules. The Bulgarian office of the EPPO is a scaled replica of the dependencies, clashes and intrigue in the national prosecution service, the author says.

A poll which was launched by the 24 Chasa daily a week ago and attracted 3,120 respondents online by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, shows that 22.4% of those polled (the largest group) intend to cast their ballots in the June 9 early parliamentary elections to keep a party they do not like from power. Another 19.7% will vote with the hope that a stable government will emerge at last after six snap elections in three years.

ECONOMY

The replacement of the first batch of 43 cartridges of Russian nuclear fuel at Reactor Unit 5 of Bulgaria's Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) with fuel from Westinghouse Electric Sweden AB, which was completed on Wednesday, was marked with a formal ceremony attended by Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev, Energy Minister Vladimir Malinov, US Ambassador to Bulgaria Kenneth Merten and senior Westinghouse executives, the media report.

Kozloduy NPP Executive Director Valentin Nikolov's words that the plant will terminate its nuclear fuel supply contract with Russia is highlighted in the main story in Duma. Nikolov said that the remaining Russian fuel will be used as a reserve. According to the daily, the price of the US fuel is similar to that of the Russian fuel, but generally, the price level has increased. Therefore, Kozloduy has asked the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission to approve a 30% hike for the electricity generated by the plant as of July 1. Later, the plant withdrew its proposal after government intervention, and suggested a lower price, not very different from the current one, Duma says.

The paper goes on to cite data from the Electricity System Operator showing that the production of electricity from baseload capacities in Bulgaria between January 1 and May 26, 2024, decreased by almost 20% year on year, and total electricity production dropped by 11.41%. Consumption declined as well. Bulgaria is turning lastingly from an exporter of electricity to an importer, Duma sums up.

The rains that have poured over Bulgaria in May have left cherries, strawberries and vegetables tasteless, 24 Chasa says in its main story. Indeed, this part of the year is usually wet, but rain can ruin the cherry crop, fruit grower Miroslav Chernikov tells the daily. He hopes that the weather gets better and the fruit that ripens later will be of higher quality. If it continues to rain, part of the cherry crop may be lost and the Bulgarian market may be dominated by cherries from Turkiye and Greece, Chernikov warns. He adds that there is no such risk with apricots.

Ministry omits important,"According to independent global energy think-tank EMBER, Hungary has the planet's third highest share of solar energy in domestic electricity production. The Ministry of Energy has presented this data as a world-class achievement. In 2023, Hungary generated 18.4 per cent of its electricity with solar power plants, surpassed only by two warmer climate countries, Chile (19.9 per cent) and Greece (19 per cent) - the Central European country outperformed solar powerhouses like Australia, Germany, and Spain.

According to the Ministry, the result is primarily due to the significant solar energy capacities that have been recently developed in Hungary. The expansion rate set records with approximately 1.1 gigawatts in 2022 and more than 1.6 gigawatts in 2023. In this year's February, the total installed capacity of solar systems exceeded the previous target of 6 gigawatts set for 2030.

According to representatives of domestic solar organisations, there is no reason to doubt the credibility of EMBER's data. In fact, this year Hungary is even expected to climb to the second place globally, thanks to new plants coming online one after another as the result of projects that had started years ago. The result also reflects that in Hungary,

over the past 10-15 years, virtually no other type of electricity generation capacity has been built - only solar.

The data cherry-picked by the Ministry, however, has several caveats. Compared to the rest of Europe, Hungary is at the last or second-to-last place year after year in terms of the share of domestic electricity production. Which means that by international standards, there is an

enormous proportion of imported electricity.

According to the data of MAVIR, the state company responsible for operating Hungary's power grid, 25.4 per cent of the country's total gross electricity consumption was imported in 2023. The import share was 27.2 per cent back in 2021, after which both production and consumption decreased.

With a domestic gross electricity production of 34.8 thousand gigawatt-hours (GWh), electricity imports amounted to nearly 20 thousand GWh, of which about 9 thousand GWh was re-exported. Compared to its potential, Hungary produces a meagre amount domestically. The main problem with this is that

imported electricity is much more expensive than covering consumer demand with domestic production

- evaluated Ernő Kiss, president of the Hungarian Photovoltaic and Solar Collector Association (MNNSZ) to our newspaper.

Kiss believes this is particularly unfavourable considering that before 1990, Hungary was practically self-sufficient in electricity.

Another slightly disheartening fact highlighted by the data promoted by the Ministry is the disproportionately large share of solar energy within the domestic renewable energy production mix. According to the energy authority, energy production of solar power plants increased by 38.1 per cent to 6,537 GWh last year, while wind power plants produced only a tenth of this amount, 644 GWh. In terms of capacity, the ratio is even worse: the installed capacity of solar panels is slightly more than 6,000 megawatts, compared to the only 350 megawatts of the country's wind turbines.

Due to the administrative restrictions of the Orbán administration, no wind power plants have been built in Hungary since 2011, while wind energy has been booming not only across Europe but also globally over the past decade.

Internationally, in terms of production ratio, solar and wind energy systems are largely balanced,

as they complement each other well: wind power plants are more productive in the winter months, while solar plants perform better in the summer.

When discussing the one-sidedness of the Ministry's data, another important factor is that geothermal energy developments have been lagging behind in Hungary, despite the country's globally outstanding geological conditions.

How is it possible that solar capacity expansion has broken records in the past two years, while the government has been placing administrative obstacles in the way of new developments since 2021? First came a quasi-ban on the authorisation of commercial and industrial consumption-reducing solar plants, followed by the suspension of feed-in opportunities for household-sized small power plants in 2022. The restrictions on the latter two categories were later largely or entirely lifted.

Associations across the industry think that

the recent boom in power plant development is predominantly driven by projects approved before 2021.

Since the development of solar power systems is a very lengthy process in Hungary, these older projects will continue to significantly increase capacities even in 2024. The boom was also staggering regarding household-sized plants -- their installed capacity increased from 0.72 gigawatts in 2020 to 2.32 gigawatts in 2023, according to MAVIR. In their case, the dreams were shattered by the feed-in stoppage and the transition from net to gross metering.

Citing limited network capacities, the government thus allows a narrow scope for the solar sector. However, both residential and investor interest would call for much more than what these limited horizons permit. At this March's publication procedure, the Ministry of Energy reported of an unexpectedly high interest by investors, targeting the installation of about 5 gigawatts of commercial plant capacity and 2.5 gigawatts of storage capacity.

Following the continuous trend since 2021, the energy authority has decided that new commercial-sized solar power plants that would feed back to the grid will not be granted connection opportunities this year, either. What's new about the announcement is that the Ministry also stated that such developers cannot expect connection opportunities until 2030, and thus the regular publication procedures are suspended as well.

With this they prevent the construction of solar plants financed by investors. Instead, it's most likely that gas turbine plant capacities will be built with public funds.

All while a gigantic portion of electricity imports could be replaced without any support"" - commented Ernő Kiss.

The cabinet, however, gives green light to newly built industrial consumption-reducing solar power plants that do not operate on a feed-in basis. As we have also reported - based on Vsquare's information - Chinese companies building battery and electric car factories have realised that the Orbán government is unable to meet their energy needs, so they will generally build their own solar power plants. These solutions will most likely be the driver behind the domestic solar sector in the near future.

As of yet, there is no unequivocal explanation to the question why policymakers continuously scrap capacity tenders while citing the limited capacity of Hungary's power grid. According to Kiss,

the solar stoppage is driven purely by political considerations,

giving way to distortions in data reporting, too. As per the official position of MAVIR and network distribution companies, capacity shortages are indeed prevalent, a condition that has been unchanging for years. However, nowhere else in Europe is the expansion of solar energy restricted due to network load.

Meanwhile, in 2024, the Utility Cost Protection Fund, now bloated to 1340 billion forints, could easily provide resources for the distribution network's development, especially amidst today's plummeting energy prices.

The solar sector is currently performing very poorly, with no new developments due to capacity shortages and the various restrictions. Projects authorised years ago are the only things contractor companies have to work on. These projects are still expected to provide the industry with some momentum this year, but the residential sector's downturn is total.

The phasing out of net metering and the introduction of gross metering, offering much less favourable returns,

have caused a shock across the sector from which no one has recovered

- claimed Ádám Szolnoki, president of MANAP Industry Association, to our newspaper.

With the new accounting rules, private clients hardly ever consider installing solar systems anymore, while most of the many projects started under the previous regime have run their course. Consequentially, layoffs are on the agenda for contractor companies, with businesses shutting down, moving abroad, or changing their profile to focus on general electrical work instead - Szolnoki explained the situation.

In addition to the delays in payments for the EU-funded residential solar program since 2022, similar problems are anticipated in the government's budget-funded 2024 solar program, too. The Ministry only announced last week that the payments for the 75 billion-forint program have begun.

On a positive note, it could be pointed out that Hungary has now come very close to meeting its commitment to the European Commission targeting 12 gigawatts of installed solar capacity by 2030. Besides already operating plants, projects that have only been granted the possibility of grid connection are also counted towards this objective - he added.",24.hu,news,24.hu,,0.1529411764705881,454760602,72,https://s.24.hu/app/uploads/2024/05/d__us20240130012-masolat-1-1024x576.jpg,eng-9607859

""Last week in Tbilisi, the seventh ministerial meeting of the Strategic Partnership for the Development and Transmission of Green Energy from Azerbaijan, through Georgia, the Black Sea to Romania, and Hungary took place. Representatives from Transelectrica, Azerenerji, Georgian GSE, and Hungarian MVM Zrt agreed to expedite the establishment of a joint venture to implement the Green Energy Corridor project, which will be registered in Bucharest,"" he said.

An Italian technical consulting firm, CESI S.p.A., is overseeing the undertaking.

The establishment of this green energy corridor will facilitate the trade of decarbonized energy, in the form of electricity and hydrogen, between the South Caucasus and the EU.

To note, on December 17, 2022, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania, and Hungary signed an agreement on a strategic partnership, which includes the construction of an energy bridge to transport green energy (from Azerbaijan's forthcoming wind farms) from the Caucasus region to Europe.

As part of this agreement, a 1,000 MW, 1,195-kilometer-long undersea electric cable is set to be constructed.

Over time, the cable will have the capacity to transport up to four gigawatts of green energy from the Caspian region to the EU.

Additionally, a system for supplying green hydrogen from the Caspian region to the EU is being explored in tandem with this cable.

The island nation is a remarkable example, as it meets all its electricity and heating needs for households and industry with renewable resources and green energy.

The Iceland Geothermal Conference, held for the fifth time in Reykjavík, provided an excellent opportunity for participants to learn about the technologies used by the world's leading country in the use of geothermal energy. Iceland's best practice demonstrates that geothermal heat is not only a stable source of energy, but also a green energy that has a positive impact on the quality of life, reports Magyar Nemzet.

The Hungarian delegation held talks with Gudlaugur Thór Thórdarson, who agreed that

They also discussed the forthcoming National Geothermal Strategy, enabling Hungary to be among the first to respond to the European Parliament's January resolution calling for accelerated investment in the sector, strengthening its position in the international geothermal sector. Attila Steiner, State Secretary, spoke at the Arctic Green Partnership Forum, which was held in parallel, and pointed out that the Hungarian EU Presidency, starting in July, intends to focus on geothermal energy as a priority issue. All the more so as

The delegation noted that the measures outlined in the National Geothermal Strategy, currently being prepared, could make geothermal energy a key sector of the Hungarian green economy. The current domestic energy use of 6.4 petajoules could double by the beginning of the next decade. The future lies in green energy, making better use of its favorable potential will strengthen energy sovereignty, contribute to increasing emission-free energy production and keep energy prices affordable.

During the program, the delegation was able to learn about Iceland's good practices and innovative solutions, discovering the country's famous Krafla power station, where the world's hottest geothermal well was drilled. The delegation gained an insight into the complex ways in which geothermal energy is being harnessed in Iceland, from extensive district heating to greenhouse vegetable production.

Bence Gonda stressed that although geothermal energy has been used in Hungary for decades,

In the autumn of 2022, the National Assembly adopted a new legal framework for the exploration, extraction and utilization of geothermal energy. This supports Hungary's energy sovereignty in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way through the increased use of geothermal energy. As proof of the success of the new regulation, the Supervisory Authority for Regulated Activities received almost 100 valid applications for exploration permits in 2023. Thanks to the investments that will be launched, the annual replacement of natural gas could reach 1-1.2 billion cubic meters by 2035.

Hungary, which will assume the Council presidency on July 1, 2024, will present the program for its six-month term.

Council conclusions on promoting Sustainable electricity network Infrastructure

The Council is expected to adopt conclusions on promoting electricity network infrastructure. These conclusions emphasize the importance of interconnected electricity network infrastructure for the functioning of the internal market, competitiveness, and achieving climate goals. The EU's electricity network must be planned over the long term at the EU level and coordinated between countries at the transmission network level, but also at the distribution network level. Additionally, the importance of energy security is highlighted, as Europe must be prepared for new threats. The conclusions also stress the importance of funding in implementing investments.

Finland welcomes the attention not only to transmission networks but also to the development of distribution networks as a prerequisite for the clean transition. Well-maintained electricity networks are considered a competitive advantage for Finland.

Finland wants to leave sufficient flexibility for member states to develop and expedite permitting processes. The promotion of new technologies requires rapid and efficient state aid control procedures by the European Commission.

Ministers to discuss the progress of the REPowerEU Plan

In spring 2022, the Commission presented the REPowerEU plan, which aims to end the EU's energy dependency on Russia by 2027. The plan includes guidelines for stopping the import of Russian gas, oil, and coal.

The EU's energy reforms and investments must focus on improving energy infrastructure, thereby promoting the security of gas supply, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). Russia's share of EU imports of natural gas has fallen from 45% to about 15% within a couple of years.

Dependence on Russian fossil fuels is also reduced by saving energy, diversifying energy sources, and accelerating the transition to clean energy.

Topics also include the Green Deal and National Energy and Climate Plans

Ministers will exchange views on the European Green Deal and how it can help transform the EU into a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy.

In other matters, the Commission will provide an update on the status of national energy and climate plans (NECPs). Member states must submit their final updated plans to the Commission by the end of June. These plans outline how the member states intend to achieve the EU's energy and climate targets for 2030. Finland's final plan will be submitted to the Commission immediately after Midsummer.

As Cold War-style rhetoric continues to intensify in the wake of Sweden and Finland's accession to NATO, Hungary's pro-Russian president Viktor Orban is now courting Belarus to expand ties and build Hungary's second nuclear power plant.

On Wednesday, despite European Union sanctions on Russian ally Belarus, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó visited MInsk, where he publicly stated, ""our position is clear: the fewer sanctions, the more cooperation!""

The two countries signed a deal in which Belarus will assist Hungary in the construction of its second new PAK reactor. The first reactor, according to Reuters, being built by Russian state-run nuclear company Rosatom, has been in the construction process since 2014. Rosatom will also build the second reactor, with cooperation from Belarus.

Hungary's first commercial nuclear power reactor began operations in the early 1980s, and it now has four nuclear reactors in operation, generating approximately half of its domestic electricity needs, according to data from the World Nuclear Association. Two new reactors currently being built by Russian Rosatom received broad parliamentary support.

""Of great importance is the agreement signed here today on nuclear energy cooperation, which allows us to use the experiences Belarus gained here while constructing reactors with a similar technology,"" Szijjarto stated, adding that Budapest would be boosting cooperation with Belarus in areas that are not targeted by sanctions, which the Hungarian foreign minister suggested were not working.

Belarus has been under EU sanctions for rigged elections, oppression of the opposition and allowing Russian troops to use the country as a staging ground for attacks on Ukraine.

May 29 (Interfax) - Energy operators in Azerbaijan, Romania, Georgia and Hungary have signed a memorandum to create a joint venture as part of the implementation of the Black Sea Energy Caspian-Black Sea-Europe Green Energy Corridor project.

The document was signed this week by Romanian power grid operator Transelectrica, Azerenerji, the Georgian State Electric System and Hungary's MVM, Romanian media reported.

The parties will take steps to create a joint venture to implement this project. The joint venture will operate in Romania, the memorandum says.

As previously reported with reference to the Ministry of Energy of Azerbaijan, the energy ministers of the four countries met on May 15 in Tbilisi and noted the need to accelerate processes related to the creation of the joint venture. As a result, it was decided to create a joint venture in Bucharest.

The initial feasibility study report from the Caspian-Black Sea-Europe Green Energy Corridor project prepared by CESI was presented during the discussions in Tbilisi, as well as a presentation of the fiber optic component. The participants agreed that the first task of the feasibility study was complete.

In addition, the meeting welcomed Bulgaria's intention to participate in the joint venture, and discussed the interest and steps taken by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in the context of strengthening regional energy security, the transition to green energy and building connections between the Central Asian, Caspian and Black Sea regions.

An agreement on a strategic partnership for the construction of a Black Sea Energy undersea electric cable with a capacity of 1 GW and a length of 1.195 thousand km was signed in Bucharest on December 17, 2022. It was announced that Bulgaria would join the project in June 2023. The cable will supply green electricity produced in Azerbaijan through Georgia and the Black Sea to Romania for onward transport to Hungary and the rest of Europe.

Some are new to the circle, like the recently promoted Portuguese minister Maria Carvalho - previously a lawmaker in the European Parliament's energy and industry committee. But most ministers know each other well after two intense years of tackling the bloc's energy crisis and actioning the EU's ambitious climate plans.

The agenda continues to be dominated by these two big-ticket items: a stock-taking of REPowerEU - the bloc's emergency plan to wean itself off Russian gas - and an assessment of the Green Deal.

While Russian coal has been entirely banished and oil relegated to a few select refineries in Eastern Europe, Russian gas remains dominant in Austria and Hungary while the Kremlin's liquified natural gas continues to arrive in Western European ports.

Berlin and Prague will push for a new high-level group to complete the EU's exit from Russian energy, Reuters reported.

Conflict ahead

The meeting will see the European Commission updating ministers on the 27 national energy and climate plans. Each EU countries must submit its final plans by 30 June and collectively, the documents will give the clearest indication yet as to whether Europe is on track to meet its 2030 climate and renewable objectives.

The plans are also expected to expose divisions within the Council.

France and Czechia lead a 14-strong alliance of pro-nuclear countries pushing for acknowledgment of low-carbon electricity equally to renewable power - and easier access to finance. They face resistence from a pro-renewables 13-country alliance led by Austria and Germany.

A whopping eight points raised by various countries will be up for discussion, a record for the term. EU diplomats attribute it to national capitals jostling to shape the next Commission's priorities.

Saying goodbye to the Belgian presidency

The meeting is the last gathering of energy ministers chaired by Belgium, who expect to conclude their biggest priority for their six-month term: following up on the EU electricity grid plan from late 2023.

The presidency has crafted a document which focuses on closing the grid investment gap, strengthening the electricity system's resilience and increasing the speed and scale of the grid expansion.

Two main barriers must be overcome: ""differences in product specifications"" across EU countries - equipment must often be tailor-made to suit the specificities of EU countries' grids - and speedier permitting.

He believes the land is effectively borrowed from his young daughter, so he must do all he can to preserve it for the future.

Kemencei, 28, wife Cintia and Boroka, almost two, moved to the farm outside Ladanybene three years ago. They keep horses, pigs and chickens on an area of 4.5 hectares, which they partly lease for grazing.

They do not use pesticides, keep their animals free range, and dig the land as little as possible to preserve the structure and moisture of the rich soil. They grow their own vegetables and slaughter or barter the meat they need, while trading the rest with families who choose a similar lifestyle.

Kemencei said while becoming fully self-sufficient seems an unrealistic goal, they rely minimally on external resources.

""This land, we have not inherited from our fathers, but we have it on a lease from our children ... so we try to live and farm the land in a sustainable way,"" he said, sitting in their cozy kitchen where a chunk of pork sizzles in the oven.

While there are no statistics on how many families are following a similar lifestyle in Hungary -- part of their choice is not necessarily to engage with central institutions -- anecdotal evidence suggests it is a growing trend.

Some want to rein in the costs of living, while for others it is to escape a consumer-driven society or live a more environmentally friendly life.

Kemencei estimates there are around 1,000 families trying to embrace some form of sustainability, either alone or as part of informal barter arrangements, or as part of more structured eco-villages.

He said a loose grouping called Sustainable Regression had around 600 to 800 members -- although not all have committed to all aspects of sustainable living.

Reuters spoke to six other families, many of whom had left jobs in the formal economy, who were now growing much of their own food. Some had their own energy and water supplies.

Akos Varga and wife Gabi, both in their late 50s, sold their IT and solar panel business four years ago to live a freer life on a farm in Nagybereny, in western Hungary.

Varga believes small, self-sustaining communities where mutual trust matters will spread.

""We thought we had achieved what we wanted and asked ourselves if this is really happiness. And we could not say yes to that,"" Varga said. ""We were seeking being close to nature.""

For Kemencei, the trusted networks matter too. A small pot-bellied pig traded with a friend is eaten from nose to tail. A rooster is swapped with another friend who is a beekeeper.

""We sometimes slaughter chickens for barter trade ... but only from a place where we know the farming is similar to ours,"" Kemencei said.

""We don't want to change the world here ... or become some kind of superheroes, there are plenty of those out there, we would like to produce most of what we need.""

Currently, they do not live off-grid. They have the internet, and buy electricity and gas for heating. But their water comes from a well and they hope to install solar panels and a wind turbine when they can afford it, Kemencei said.

They can get by on about 250,000 forints ($680) per month, outside of emergencies. They buy milk, sugar and other basics that they cannot grow themselves.

The family have a walipini greenhouse for plants -- a hole in the ground covered with polyethylene glazing. The name means ""place of warmth"" in the language in Bolivia where the practice comes from.

""We should reduce our wants just a little, as now we live in a world where we sit on a galloping horse and when the horse dies, we just jump on another one,"" he said.

Mr. Mach, your party is known to be highly critical of EU regulations, and in fact would like Czechs to be able to vote in a referendum on whether they want to stay in the EU or leave. So I assume that you're running in the elections in order to try and change something in the way that the European Union works or the set course. Is that right?

""Yes, you are absolutely right. We oppose regulation in general on the European Union level. And the strongest regulation ever is the Green Deal. It is supposed to completely ban combustion engines from the European Union market as of 2035. It makes energy, electricity, and other energy sources very expensive, and it makes Czech businesses less competitive in comparison with the rest of the world. I think it really endangers our industry, it makes the life of ordinary people very difficult because it makes energy expensive. My goal in the European Parliament is to have a new vote on the Green Deal. We want to completely vote it down.""

""There is a chance, for the first time in the history of the European Parliament, that the opposition could have a stronger vote, and push through on some issues. ""

So you feel that at this point, Euro critics stand a bigger chance of gaining a voice in the European Parliament?

""Yes, I do, for the first time in history. We can observe that from the very beginning of the EU, it has been ruled by a grand coalition of the Party of European Socialists and European People's Party. Those who opposed giving more power to the EU were considered, by the majority, as enemies and as people who have no right to participate in the decision-making. Now, there is a chance for the first time in the history of the European Parliament, that this opposition could have a stronger vote, and push through on some issues, including the Green Deal.""

Even if that turns out to be so, climate change is a problem that is not going to go away and needs to be addressed. You may argue that Europe is not financially in shape to implement the Green Deal. But what would you do instead?

""First of all, I think that the Green Deal is counter-productive. Under the Green Deal, the emissions of carbon dioxide are much more expensive in Europe than the emissions of the same volume of carbon dioxide in China. In China, they also have an emissions trading scheme, but there the price is different. (The price is set by the government or the European Union, depending on how many permits it issues.) Due to the fact that the same volume of C02 emissions is more expensive in Europe than in China, this directly leads to businesses closing in Europe and going to China. And paradoxically, production in China, India, or Brazil, is often more expensive for energy.

""Due to the Green Deal, C02 emissions in Europe went down by maybe one-third, but global emissions rose significantly because the production moved from Europe elsewhere.""

""So, by adopting the Green Deal, we will completely undercut our economy, and the impact on the global climate is rather the opposite. We can observe that due to the Green Deal, C02 emissions in Europe went down by maybe one-third, but global emissions rose significantly because the production moved from Europe elsewhere. It simply does not work. My idea is that it would be much better if in the Czech Republic we could decide ourselves what to do. For instance, I myself would be in favour of re-forestation - I think that this would be a much better solution for our country. We would have better forests and more forests, and it would be a small contribution to the global climate as well.""

Turning now to some very divisive issues in this campaign. Opinion polls show that what Czechs are most concerned about is migration and safety. Looking at migration first, Czechia is one of the 15 EU member states which has just sent the Commission a letter asking for it to look for new ways to address the problem of migration with the help of third countries. What is your take on the present Migration Pact and what would you want to change about it?

""If a migrant from North Africa arrives in Europe, and he doesn't want to come to the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic doesn't want him - why should we be obliged to accept him or pay instead?""

""We strongly oppose the Migration Pact, and just like I want a new vote on the Green Deal, I also want a new vote on the Migration Pact. We have criticized the government, who in our opinion, was not telling the truth. They said there are no quotas, they said we would eventually have an exemption, because we have hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, and I claim that neither of these things are true. In the Migration Pact, the Commission is supposed to set the number of migrants that each country should have, calculated on the basis of population numbers and the GDP of the EU. For the Czech Republic, it should be a 3% share. There is an option that instead of taking in migrants, you can pay out - which would be very expensive for the Czech Republic. If a migrant from North Africa arrives in Europe, and he doesn't want to come to the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic doesn't want him - why should we be obliged to accept him or pay instead? There is no logic.""

But we are a part of the European Union, and the EU has a problem. So how would you go about resolving it? Would you support the suggestion that the EU should cooperate with third countries outside of the EU for the problem to be resolved there, so there isn't such an influx? How would you go about it?

""First of all, each member state should be completely responsible for protecting its borders. In the Czech Republic, people can only arrive to the Schengen area by plane, and we completely protect these borders. No one without a proper visa or passport can enter the country illegally by plane. Countries like Hungary and Poland have built fences to protect their land borders. The same responsibility should lie with the countries that have a maritime border, and they should be responsible for turning the ships that take illegal immigrants back to their country of origin. This is the first point - every country from the Schengen area should protect its external borders. If the EU can help with something, it could negotiate with Libya and maybe Turkey, so the EU, on behalf of the member states, could open some migration centres on their territory, where the migrants would wait for a decision as to whether a member state would accept them or not.""

Staying on the subject of security and looking at the war in Ukraine, the Czech Republic has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the war began and has sent military and humanitarian aid. Some parties are now increasingly pushing for peace negotiations. What is your take on this? Should the country continue helping, and if so, in what way? And what should be the stance of the EU?

""We have called for peace negotiations from the very beginning. I am afraid that the current strategy of the West and Ukraine is wrong and inefficient. If the current goal of Ukraine and the West, at least as it is officially declared, is to get the whole territory of Ukraine back under its control, it seems to me that the current strategy is not working. I'm afraid that the current strategy will only lead to a situation where Ukraine will have no more soldiers to fight, which would be a clear victory for Russia. I think we should change our strategy, and peace negations are the obvious way how to deal with this situation.""

In the meantime, are you against further military aid to the country?

""I think that what should come in the first place should be a basic elementary agreement on a cease fire, which would open the door to peace negotiations. Because, if the official position of the West and Ukraine is ""We are ready to negotiate only after all Russian troops leave Ukrainian territory"" then that is simply not realistic. They need to accept that peace negotiations should start, there could be a cease fire, and that could open up a space for the negotiations to proceed. I think that maybe a referendum could be organized under some international surveillance.""

A referendum on what?

""In the eastern territories of Ukraine, in the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk republics referenda could take place in which people could vote on whether they want to be part of Ukraine, whether they want independence or whether they want to belong to Russia. In my opinion -if there is a clear tendency of these people to declare their independence from Ukraine, then the civilized way how to resolve this is a referendum and not a war.""

Turning back to the workings of the European Union - decision making and the right of veto. The right of veto is still implemented in three areas of EU decision making. I understand that you are strongly against abolishing that right in those areas?

""Yes, in my opinion, international cooperation should be based on unanimity, that is on the right of veto. Therefore, I was strongly against the Lisbon Treaty back in 2009, because it gave more powers to the EU, it moved many areas of decision-making from unanimity to a qualified majority vote. So we oppose any proposals to get rid of the unanimity principle in the few remaining areas where we have it.""

But it also complicates decision making sometimes, so how would you address that?

""I would love it if the EU moved back to being as it was before Maastricht, or I would love an EU that would look like EFTA, the European Free Trade Association.""

""In my opinion, no one should prevent countries who want to have some common policy to have it, but we should not force countries who don't want it, to participate. For example, countries that want to have the euro can have it, but countries who want to retain their own national currency should not be forced to give it up. Another example is that some countries are part of the Schengen area and some are not. Therefore, I don't think we need a qualified majority, I think we can have a European Union where countries participate or not in different areas, on the premise of voluntary participation. Those who want to have some policies can have them, and those who don't want to participate should not be forced to do so.""

It sounds like you would prefer a European Union as it was 25 years ago, a looser alliance of states, rather than it being closer-knit?

""Exactly. I would love it if the EU moved back to being as it was before Maastricht, or I would love an EU that would look like EFTA, the European Free Trade Association. If you look at EFTA, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, they don't have any system of tax redistribution or subsidies, they do not need a common currency to trade. EFTA is based on unanimity, everyone in EFTA has veto power over everything, and it works quite efficiently.""

""I oppose any enlargement. We don't like the fact that we are out-voted in more and more areas, or that our taxpayers' money is used for something else than in favour of Czech, and any enlargement would only add to this.""

Looking at the future European Union, are you in favour of expansion?

""I think it should be clear from what I have said, that under the current situation, with the many powers of the EU, the vast regulation, redistribution, and qualified majority voting, I oppose any enlargement. We don't like the fact that we are out-voted in more and more areas, or that our taxpayers' money is used for something else than in favour of Czech citizens, and any enlargement would only add to this.""

Why is it important for Europeans to go to the polls in these elections?

""Because the European Union has the power to decide on legislation. It decides on how expensive energies are, what we can use for driving, whether some engines are banned or not. The civilized way to have your say is to vote and be represented in the body where these decisions are taken. Those who favour these decisions, as well as those who oppose them, have the right to be represented in the European Parliament. I encourage everyone to take advantage of this right to vote in the European elections.""",english.radio.cz,news,Radio Prague International,,0.1450980392156862,454667105,1,https://english.radio.cz/sites/default/files/styles/twitter/public/images/eaa0ade127cc4aa0a35e78ffa5542960.jpg?itok=ZH_gZkdw,

In a statement, they called Iceland, a leader in geothermal innovation, a ""remarkable example"", noting that it covers household and industry electricity and heating needs entirely with renewable resources and green energy.

They said the Geothermal Conference organised in Reykjavik for the fifth time had served as an excellent opportunity for participants to learn more about how Iceland is a global leader in the utilisation of geothermal energy. The statement said the practice employed by Iceland was a ""model"" in demonstrating that geothermal heat was not only a stable source of energy, but, as eco-friendly green energy, also had a positive effect on the quality of life.

The Hungarian delegation and Thordarson were in agreement on the primary importance of geothermal energy today, noting it was valuable, safe, sustainable and renewable alternative source in the energy mix. They touched on Hungary's National Geothermal Strategy currently being finalised, which could help Hungary be the first member state to respond to the European Parliament's opinion issued in January urging the acceleration of investments in the sector.

The statement said Steiner had addressed the Arctic Green Partnership Forum held simultaneously with the Iceland Geothermal Conference. The state secretary said Hungary will place special emphasis on the topic of geothermal energy during its upcoming EU presidency in the second half of the year, noting that Hungary had long been among the top five countries in Europe when it came to the use of geothermal energy.

Over the course of the programme, the Hungarian delegation got to learn more about Iceland's best practices and innovative solutions, and was shown the country's most modern power plant along with the Krafla power plant where the world's hottest geothermal well was drilled.

At the ministers' meeting, Bence Gonda, the deputy head of the Supervisory Authority for Regulated Activities, emphasised that that though Hungary had been using geothermal energy for decades, the goal in the new regulatory environment and based on the National Geothermal Strategy was to exploit the country's favourable geothermal resources as efficiently as possible.",dailynewshungary.com,news,Daily News Hungary,,0.7647058823529411,454664970,13,https://contentf5.dailynewshungary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Hungarian-delegation-visits-geothermal-innovation-world-leader.jpg,eng-9603643

The Strategic Collaboration and Investment will enable Lenovo to further accelerate its ongoing transformation, enhance its global presence, increase geographic diversification of its manufacturing footprint, and capitalize on the growth momentum of the IT and Business Services industry in the MEA region. The Strategic Collaboration serves as a strong endorsement of Lenovo's existing strategy, strong execution, operational excellence, commitment to sustainability, and continuous investment in innovation.

The Strategic Collaboration, alongside a proposed US$2 billion Investment in zero coupon convertible bonds (""Bond Issue""), provides Lenovo with greater financial flexibility to implement its proven strategy, and will further drive its global transformation into a solutions and services-led business. The Strategic Collaboration includes a planned establishment of a regional MEA headquarters in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and a new PC and server manufacturing facility in the Kingdom to serve customers in the region. KSA is entering a new era of clean energy and has a goal to produce 50% of electricity from renewables by 2030. In support of that goal and Lenovo's own 2050 net-zero target, Lenovo will be able to contribute to this vision and at the same time benefit from KSA's clean power and sustainable manufacturing initiatives to help reach its own targets. It will also enable Lenovo to enhance its global supply chain resilience and flexibility by adding another location to its existing global footprint, and to serve customers in the MEA region more nimbly.

The MEA region continues to see strong growth momentum fueled by an increasing number of large-cap projects and its strong economies, with the region's IT and Business Services market size expected to reach close to US$38 billion by 2027, according to IDC estimates.** Building on Lenovo's industry leadership in the MEA region and globally, the partnership with Alat will help Lenovo tap into the robust growth in the region, unlock the transformative potential of digital technologies, and further enhance Lenovo's position as a global technology powerhouse.

Yuanqing Yang, Chairman and CEO of Lenovo, said: ""Through this powerful strategic collaboration, Lenovo will have significant resources and financial flexibility to further accelerate our transformation and grow our business by capitalizing on the incredible growth momentum in the MEA region. Looking ahead, Lenovo plans to build a tech & manufacturing hub in Saudi Arabia and will help define the future of the region as a center of innovation which Alat will benefit from. This is a huge vote of confidence in our company, our market leadership, and our future growth potential.""

Alat, a PIF company, was launched on February 1, 2024, and will create a global sustainable technology manufacturing hub in Saudi Arabia focused on advanced industrials and electronics. Initially its key strategic business areas will be semiconductors, smart devices, smart buildings, smart appliances, smart health, advanced industrials, next gen infrastructure technologies, electrification, and AI infrastructure. More information can be found here.

Details of the Strategic Collaboration and Investment

As part of the agreement, Lenovo will set up a regional MEA headquarters in Riyadh, which will include a customer center and a research and development center focusing on the MEA Region. Lenovo will also establish a new PC and server manufacturing facility in the KSA, extending the company's existing global footprint which already includes 30+ manufacturing sites around the world spanning Argentina, Brazil, China, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, Mexico, and the USA.

In addition, the parties have entered into a Bond Subscription Agreement in which Lenovo will issue US$2 billion in convertible bonds to Alat, the net proceeds of which will be used for repaying existing debts of Lenovo and general corporate and working capital purposes. The Convertible Bonds are due in three years after issuance and will be convertible to equity at maturity at an initial conversion price of HK$10.42 per share. This represents an approximately 10% premium over the average VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) for the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date of the Bond Subscription Agreement. The closing of Lenovo's issuance and Alat's subscription of the Convertible Bonds is subject to, among others, Lenovo shareholders' approval, and obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Strategic Collaboration Framework Agreement, Alat will have the right to nominate a non-executive director candidate to Lenovo's Board subject to normal procedures for director appointments in Hong Kong.

Proposed Warrants Issuance

Additionally, Lenovo's Board has approved a Proposed Warrants Issuance for 1,150,000,000 Warrants at an issue price of HK$1.43 per Warrant. The proposed three year Warrants issuance will enable Lenovo to raise additional funds to support future growth, while at the same time broadening its capital base, and is a further vote of confidence in the company's ongoing transformation, global market leadership, and growth momentum. Once approved at Lenovo's General Meeting, the Warrants will be issued via a private placement handled by Citigroup Global Markets Asia Limited.

Decreases in demand follow the EU Council Regulation's coordinated reduction measures passed in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

As of 2022, natural gas and electricity made up two-third of the EU's energy portfolio, with renewable energy representing a growing tenth.

The EU imports 90% of its natural gas, but decreased the fuel's imports by 18.4 million terajoules last year, about 20% of 2022 rates.

A measurement of energy consumption, one terajoule equals one trillion joules.

The EU's highest producers of natural gas, the Netherlands and Romania, each produced more than 350,000 terajoules in 2023, just about enough energy to satisfy demands from Hungary or Austria. Germany produced 143,532 terajoules of natural gas last year, about 3% of its nearly 3 million terajoule demand.

The five nations that use the most natural gas all reduced consumption last year, with Germany reducing the fuel's use by 2.96 million terajoules, nearly 4% of overall demand compared with 2022. At the same tine, Italy cut its own natural gas budget by 10%, and France by nearly 12%, each adding up to more than a million terajoule reduction.

Only six member states reported increased natural gas use last year, with Finland's use jumping more than 25% and Sweden's by 11%.

To respond to it and achieve green and low-carbon transition, it calls for support from more quality production capacity.

The new energy production capacity around the world today falls significantly short of meeting the demand of the market, especially huge latent demand in developing countries.

The narrative of so-called ""overcapacity"" in China's new energy industry as well as the protectionist measures stemming from it hinder the development of green industries of the world and the concerted efforts made by the international community to respond to climate change.

The development of China's new energy industry has made significant contributions to the global green and low-carbon transition, in response to the needs of countries to alleviate energy crises and address climate change.

In 2022, China's exports of wind power and photovoltaic products resulted in a reduction of approximately 573 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions for other countries.

According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, over the past decade, the average cost of electricity per kWh from wind power and photovoltaic projects around the world has cumulatively decreased by more than 60 percent and 80 percent respectively, and a significant portion of this achievement is attributed to China's innovation, manufacturing, and engineering projects.

China's green capacity has brought positive spillover effects to other countries. In Kazakhstan, the 60MW Shelek Wind Farm invested and built by a Chinese company helps reduce over 160,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions on an annual basis. In the United Arab Emirates, the Al Dhafra Solar Project contracted by a Chinese company supplies electricity to 200,000 households and reduces carbon emissions by 2.4 million tons each year.

The claim that China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity just cannot hold water.

In order to achieve the temperature goals set out in the Paris Agreement and help countries fulfill their commitments to peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, it is needed to increase investment in the clean energy sector and enhance the supply of new energy products globally.

For instance, the new energy vehicle (NEV) industry is seeing a huge demand globally. According to the International Energy Agency, the global demand for NEVs is expected to reach 45 million units by 2030.

Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto pointed out that overcapacity doesn't exist, and there is indeed a lack of capacity.

China's green capacity poses no threat to the development of other countries' industries. Instead, it promotes their industrial growth through extensive cooperation and healthy competition.

According to Peter Fischer, chief economist of the Swiss daily Neue Zurcher Zeitung, it is with China's assistance that the West has gained access to more cost-effective solar panels and wind turbines. Furthermore, China's innovative NEVs can drive the transformation of European car manufacturers, which ultimately benefits consumers.

An article on the website of The Diplomat said that Southeast Asian nations are actively courting Chinese electric vehicle companies in a collaboration that not only strengthens the imperative transition away from fossil fuel vehicles, but also fuels economic growth through technological exchange.

It is contradictory to emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change while labeling China's renewable energy industry as ""overcapacity."" Such accusations of ""overcapacity"" are merely excuses for protectionism. Facts have long indicated that such practice benefits no one and will eventually backfire.

Adopting protectionist policies and setting up trade barriers not only disrupts the global investment landscape of green industries but also hampers the efficient allocation of green resources worldwide.

This leads to inefficient capacity and redundant construction, increasing the cost of low-carbon transition in countries that adopt these policies. Furthermore, it will hinder the global development of clean energy and impose significant negative impacts on the world economy.

As Bloomberg recently argued, despite implementing steel protectionist measures over the past decade, Washington has failed to prevent the decline in employment within the U.S. metal manufacturing industry. Instead, these measures have increased costs in other sectors of the U.S. economy and reduced competitiveness of the industry. If these measures were to be applied to the new energy sector, they would further weaken America's ability to tackle climate change.

Blocking technological progress and suppressing high-quality production capacity is not the right path for economic development. China stands by its basic national policy of opening up and is ready to work with all parties to uphold fair competition and benefit from cooperation together.

It is hoped that relevant countries will maintain an open mindset, abide by market economy principles and international economic and trade rules, and provide a fair, transparent, open, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises.",newsghana.com.gh,news,News Ghana,People's Daily,0.3725490196078431,454632427,4,https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/photovoltaic-power-project-in-Yangzhou.png,

By Sofia Sanchez Manzanaro

In April 2024, the trial of nine people accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the German government began in Stuttgart. The case suggests what can happen when, in extreme circumstances, people feel politically alienated.

The suspects were, in the words of German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, 'driven by hatred towards our democracy.'

Local voices

Participation by residents in local decision-making across Europe can bolster public trust in their systems of democratic rule and limit the risk that dissatisfaction with governance veers towards violence, according to James Scott, a professor of regional and border studies at the Karelian Institute of the University of Eastern Finland.

'The important thing in the process is that people are involved - that they have a sense that we are co-making a decision,' said Scott, who is also an expert on populist movements. 'Not only are we deciding on it, but we also see that these decisions lead to concrete results.'

He leads a research project that received EU funding to examine and help spur more inclusive forms of local governance in Europe. Called EUARENAS, the project began in January 2021 and is due to run through October 2024.

The project is entering its final five months as Europe gears up for EU legislative elections that take place twice a decade. On 6-9 June, voters in the 27 EU Member States will choose 720 members of the European Parliament.

Along with the Council of Ministers representing national governments, the Parliament decides on European laws covering everything from food safety and airline passenger rights to car emissions and electricity supplies.

The assembly also acts as the EU's budget authority and plays a key role in the formation of each European Commission leadership team following the legislative ballot.

Elections to the EU Parliament are in part a barometer of voter sentiment towards national governments and can trigger political changes within Member States.

In the last EU legislative ballot in 2019, voter turnout rose for the first time since the initial European Parliament elections in 1979. Europe's two main political families - the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists - saw their seat totals drop by more than 30 each.

Mind the gap

Many people in Europe view their governance system as too distant to be influenced, leading to a polarisation of public debate and a rise in anti-democratic political forces, according to Scott.

To counter this trend, EUARENAS has studied examples of social movements and local government actions to expand political participation. It also encouraged grassroots initiatives such as neighbourhood assemblies, participatory budget communities and ""citizen panels"".

The project has brought together academics, local authorities, policy experts and social activists in seven European countries: Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK.

'Many organisations are out there trying to promote a closer sense of citizen engagement, belonging and ownership of governance processes,' said Scott.

The EUARENAS team has analysed and enacted pilot programmes in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the UK.

Opening up

One initiative by the project is a housing and urban development plan involving residents of the Polish coastal city of Gdansk.

'We didn't want to create the master plan from the top down but instead to involve the communities affected by it in the decision-making process,' said Scott.

In the Italian city of Reggio Emilia, residents represented in neighbourhood panels designed an agenda to address the main challenges people face. High among their concerns was the climate crisis.

In the Estonian town of Võru, which is grappling with an exodus of young people, EUARENAS identified ways to enhance their quality of life and employment prospects.

Residents of Võru addressed education on mental health and the well-being of youngsters, with one initiative placing stickers with QR codes in two schools. The codes linked to mental health websites.

A prominent role played by young people in the area was reflected in first-hand testimonies collected by EUARENAS.

Lasse Rihard Sissas, a ninth grader from Võru, cited his strong connection to the region and its natural beauty. He recommended more learning opportunities for people his age and called for the creation of a local university.

'It would be nice if there was a university here,' Sissas said in a project video. 'Young people would stay.'

Regardless of the particular local challenges, more inclusive decision-making at that level can limit the risks of social divisions and political exploitation of them by reactionary political forces, according to Scott.

'Decision-making has to be more democratic, more open,' said Scott.

Bridge-building

In the German trial in Stuttgart, prosecutors have charged the nine suspects with plotting a coup aimed at installing an aristocrat in power. German police reportedly foiled the alleged plot during raids in 2022.

The court proceedings are among three German trials this year involving a total of 26 defendants, all of whom are accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the federal government.

One challenge in nurturing grassroots involvement in public debates is that people who harbour extreme views are more reluctant to voice them, according to Pierangelo Isernia, a professor of political science at the University of Siena in Italy.

'They think they will be exposed and attacked because of their ideas,' he said.

Isernia led another EU-funded project into how liberal democracies can tackle political polarisation through more inclusive decision-making. Called EUCOMMEET, the project wrapped up in February 2024 after three years.

Language lessons

It featured an experiment involving a total of more than 400 people in five EU countries: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Poland.

The participants exchanged views on the climate crisis - a topic that Isernia said has had an increasingly polarising effect in Europe and beyond.

Initially, the exchanges took place locally by involving people from the same city. Then the conversations became national and, finally, European with a concluding plenary session in which people from at least three countries exchanged views.

The sessions each involved eight to 10 people. In a reflection of the experiment's cross-border nature, an open-source online platform allowed the participants to communicate in their native languages.

'People could discuss in their language and understand what others were saying,' said Isernia. 'We showed that this is possible.'

A main finding of EUCOMMEET is that exchanges of these kinds among people help reduce divisions over any given topic.

Isernia said he hopes that platforms like the one developed by the project will be integrated into future EU efforts to involve the general public in policy considerations.

For instance, he recommends that the next European Commission organise 'short-term consultations' to capture evolving public opinions.

'Surveys are not enough to understand what people really think,' said Isernia. 'You need to see how a person evolves in their thinking through a conversation and deliberative processes are the best way of understanding this.'",moderndiplomacy.eu,news,Modern Diplomacy,,-0.2862745098039216,454629905,1,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/european-union.jpg,

Israel's military attack targeting two Hamas operatives, which ended up killing at least 45 Palestinian civilians and wounding another 249 people, highlighted once again the concerns that the Biden administration and many in the international community have raised about the high human costs of an Israeli military operation in Rafah. The deadly strike was widely criticized around the world. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a ""tragic accident"" and promised a complete investigation in a speech to the Israeli Knesset Monday night.

Yet again, another incident in the Israel-Hamas war exposes the hollowness of many of the statements and policy moves aimed at enhancing protections for civilians caught in the crosshairs in a war between Hamas and Israel.

More than three months ago, US President Joe Biden was asked in an MSNBC television interview if an invasion of Rafah was a red line, Biden replied, ""It is a red line."" In that same interview, Biden voiced criticisms of Israel's conduct in the war, saying that Netanyahu was ""hurting Israel more than helping Israel,"" and he argued that the Israeli prime minister ""must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken."" Like the ""red line"" in the Syrian civil war articulated by the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice president, it seems like there are few or no consequences for crossing this red line, though the Biden administration is still waiting to hear more facts on this attack before making a determination about its policy approach.

For the past few weeks, the Biden administration has engaged the Israeli government in extensive discussions about the military operation in Rafah, aiming to prioritize the protection of civilians. Even after hundreds of thousands of civilians moved to get out of the way, innocent civilians and international aid workers continue to be killed in military operations targeting Hamas and its military capabilities.

As I outlined in a special MEI assessment at the six-month mark of the war, the Biden administration this spring has made more statements and taken policy steps to increase the level of humanitarian assistance getting to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. But it remains to be seen what major impact these statements and measures have had on Israel's conduct of the war. For sure, Hamas continues to cynically use innocent civilians and hides behind them as shields, complicating the military effort; but the loss of innocent civilian lives continues to mount.

Moreover, America's growing isolation in the world regarding how it speaks and acts on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza is increasingly evident. The Biden administration, which has episodically talked about a ""values based"" foreign policy, has struggled to apply this framework to the Gaza war. It held two ""Summits for Democracy"" aimed at stressing its support for such a foreign policy, but none of these exercises have seemed to generate policies or principles that the Biden administration has been able to apply to this war, no doubt a complicated task.

Adding to this dismal scene is the fact that Biden's chief rival in the 2024 presidential election, former US President Donald Trump, has told donors that he would crush pro-Palestinian protests and deport demonstrators if he is elected president again. The lack of empathy for Palestinian civilians remains apparent across America's political spectrum.

Mirette F. Mabrouk

Senior Fellow and Founding Director of the Egypt program

The costs of the ongoing conflict in Gaza continue to soar. Just two days after a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that ordered Israel to ""immediately halt its offensive in Rafah,"" a nighttime Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp of displaced Palestinians sheltering in an area that had been designated as a humanitarian safe zone. As of Monday evening, at least 45 people were reported killed and hundreds more injured, either in the initial explosions or the subsequent fires they ignited that raged through the camp.

While the human costs of the conflict continue to escalate -- 1,200 Israelis killed in the original attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, and 250 taken hostage, and over 36,000 Palestinians killed since then (the majority of whom are women and children), according to the Gazan Ministry of Health -- there have been other costs as well. While none of them will compare to the toll of the civilian deaths, they might well have greater regional ramifications, including the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Egypt and Israel.

Over the past 55 years, the Camp David Accords have been the bedrock of regional stability. Once Egypt made peace with Israel, it removed itself from any military conflict, effectively guaranteeing that Israel would not be attacked by any Arab army. Over the decades, the relationship between the two countries developed into a solid one -- never on a people-to-people basis, but in terms of intelligence, security, and political cooperation. One of the very few weak points in this relationship has always been the status of the Palestinians. Public opinion in Egypt is consistently and overwhelmingly empathetic with the Palestinians, and the current conflict in Gaza has intensified that sentiment significantly. The Egyptian government has had to tread an extremely fine line between managing the country's diplomatic commitments and taking into account public opinion. However, the conflict has created one diplomatic challenge after another. At the beginning, Israel lobbied the European Union to pressure Egypt into taking Palestinian refugees, something Cairo refused to do, both for its own security as well as, more importantly, to avoid being complicit in another forced displacement of Palestinians. The Egyptians felt that the Israelis were continuously testing their boundaries; while Israel stated that it was not its intention to force Palestinians into Egypt, it pushed them up against its border in Rafah, leaving them with nowhere else to flee, setting up a reverse exodus.

Tensions have only continued to rise since then. The raising of the Israeli flag in Rafah, also in violation of the 1978 treaty, caused resentment across the border, leading the Egyptians to close the Rafah border to aid for the first time since the conflict began. They maintained that since Israel was now an occupying force in Rafah, it had to live up to its obligations under international law and take responsibility for the people it occupied. When Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that ""the key to preventing a humanitarian crisis in Gaza is now in the hands of our Egyptian friends,"" his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry shot back his country's ""categorical rejection of the policy of distorting facts and disavowing responsibility adopted by Israel,"" asserting that Israel was ""solely responsible for the humanitarian catastrophe currently endured by Palestinians in Gaza"" and calling on it to ""assume its legal responsibility as the occupying power by allowing aid access through the land ports that are under its control.""

And to further exacerbate tensions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared last April that Israel had to have control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the 14-km buffer zone between Egypt and Gaza, which the Egyptians have warned is in violation of an amendment to the peace accords. Egyptian security personnel were also worried that the presence of Israeli troops right on Egypt's doorstep would increase the risks of a border incident.

And then, on May 27, initial Israeli reports emerged of an exchange of gunfire across the border between Egyptian and Israeli forces, resulting in the death of an Egyptian soldier. Both militaries said the incident was under review and they ""were discussing"" it with each other. Later that evening, Egypt warned against ""compromising the security and safety of its security forces,"" a high-level source told Egypt's state-linked Al Qahera News.

Preliminary investigations showed that Egyptian security personnel had reacted to an exchange of gunfire ""between Israeli forces and members of the Palestinian resistance, which led to shooting in several directions,"" the source said, adding that Egypt would take the necessary measures to prevent the incident from recurring. In fact, the incident exemplified one of Egypt's major concerns since October of last year: that the conflict would spill over its borders. That eventuality isn't in anyone's interest.

In what would be a devastating blow to the Palestinian economy, Israel is poised to terminate the safeguards supporting correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) between Palestinian and Israeli banks. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced last week plans to halt the transfer of clearance revenue -- Palestinian taxes collected by Israel -- to the Palestinian Authority. Additionally, he will not extend the indemnity granted to Israeli banks that facilitate fund transfers to Palestinian financial institutions. CBRs are indispensable for enabling financial transactions between the Palestinian economy, Israel, and the global market.

The Israeli government has been granting temporary ""letters of indemnity and immunity"" to protect Israeli banks from both domestic and international perceived risks or legal repercussions linked to transactions with Palestinian banks. These indemnity letters have been routinely renewed, typically for periods ranging from six months to a year, by the Israeli finance minister. The indemnity period that concluded in September 2023 was renewed for six months, whereas the one that concluded on March 31, 2024, was extended at the last minute for only three months.

The failure to extend these letters would plunge the economy of the Palestinian Territories into complete collapse. The Palestinian economy primarily functions using the Israeli shekel as its de facto currency, making it dependent on financial linkages with Israel for transactions both domestically and internationally. These transactions are exclusively facilitated by the Bank of Israel and private Israeli banks. Disrupting this connection would impede critical banking services, including fund transfers, card transactions, and check clearing.

Furthermore, it might manifest in a humanitarian catastrophe. Fuel shortages would ensue rapidly, as fuel is supplied daily from the Israeli market. Import activities from Israel and international markets would grind to a halt, leaving Palestinian traders unable to compensate their Israeli and global counterparts. This disruption would precipitate a supply shock in food and other essential goods, causing prices to soar and eventually leading to severe shortages. Additionally, electricity, water, internet, and phone supplies would be disrupted, as payments to Israeli suppliers would be largely unfeasible.

This crisis would unfold against a backdrop of a multifaceted, decade-long economic and fiscal crisis, compounded since October 2023. Recent reports estimate a GDP decline of over 80 percent in Gaza, while unemployment there has soared to 75 percent. Whereas in the West Bank, Israeli closure policies and the suspension of at least 144,000 work permits for Palestinian workers in Israel and Israeli settlements have led to the loss of 300,000 jobs. The Palestinian Authority is operating on shallow aid handouts while accumulating arrears against domestic suppliers valued at 50 percent of GDP.

If Smotrich implements his threat to suspend the existing CBR arrangement without establishing an alternative system to facilitate the necessary clearance and transfer requirements, the Palestinian banking system's connection to the global market will be severed, and the economic crisis developing in the West Bank will likely transform into a humanitarian catastrophe.

Perhaps Ireland's, Spain's, and Norway's decision to recognize Palestinian statehood will help resurrect the vision of a two-state solution, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defiantly rejects despite the international community's long-standing support for it. Perhaps, as Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez rushed to clarify, this is not to be seen as a move against Israel -- Netanyahu decried it as a ""reward for terrorism"" -- but as a contribution to peace. Perhaps more European countries will soon follow, joining the global grouping of over 140 states (out of 193 members of the United Nations) that support Palestinian statehood. Perhaps. But at this difficult juncture, with Rafah coming under heavy fire despite calls by the International Court of Justice, the United States, the European Union, and others to spare the city, it is hard not to write this diplomatic initiative off as yet another sign of internal European division, revealing Europe's continuing failure to exert coordinated pressure on Israel.

The diplomatic move by Ireland, Spain, and Norway was widely expected, in light of their respective national debates and growing public support for bold gestures in favor of Palestine's long-standing claim. What is more interesting -- and politically relevant -- is that other European countries that have been leaning toward the same approach are for now refraining, among them Malta, Slovenia, and Belgium. Indeed, during its presidency of the Council of the European Union (January to present), Belgium has been increasingly vocal about Palestinian rights; but upcoming national elections, among other factors, may have suggested some caution. In fact, with the several national election cycles in play and the election of a new European Parliament scheduled for June 6-9, European governments have decided to handle the sensitive Middle East file differently depending on domestic political circumstances and the color of their ruling parties.

Against this patchy background, Ireland's and Spain's decision (Norway is not an EU member) is more significant for breaking EU ranks than for its concrete legal implications. The fewer than 10 EU members that had already recognized Palestinian statehood almost all did so in 1988, before they entered the EU (they are mostly former members of the Warsaw Pact). Until this past week's recognition declarations, only Sweden had similarly broken ranks within the EU on Palestine, in 2014. Moreover, the fact that the current Swedish government has a different stance on the Palestinian question from the social democrats who ruled the country in the mid-2010s shows how volatile the issue can be. What is sorely missing is a pondered approach that would apply to all 27 EU member states, transcending national political cycles and today's agendas. While views within the EU have converged somewhat since the outbreak of the ongoing war, an EU-wide consensus remains elusive.

It would be too cynical to dismiss the entire EU diplomatic effort after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack as futile. The EU High Representative Josep Borrell has relentlessly worked to coordinate a common European position at critical turning points of the conflict, sometimes successfully so. The Spanish and Belgian presidencies of the EU have worked in tandem during 2023-2024 to persuade Israel that a resumption of peace talks is instrumental to the political -- as opposed to just military -- defeat of Hamas. And with the Israeli government deeply reluctant to change the parameters of its open-ended military campaign that has killed tens of thousands, EU heavyweights Germany and France have become increasingly critical of Israeli policy. French President Emmanuel Macron notably stated in February that the recognition of Palestinian statehood is no longer a taboo for Paris.

Yet the EU has for now failed to coalesce around measures that would exert tangible pressure, signally in the field of trade and economic relations (the EU is the biggest provider of Palestinian assistance and Israel's largest trade partner). It is reported that sanctions were for the first time seriously discussed during the latest meeting of EU foreign ministers; but predictably, an agreement was not within reach at this time.

While it is important that the EU remains actively involved in the resolution of the conflict, as it is doing by engaging Arab countries, its international agency remains to date hostage to its internal differences and political cycles. With uncompromisingly pro-Israel Hungary taking over the presidency of the EU Council in July, distilling a common and meaningful European Union position will continue to be a challenge.

The April 13 Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel was a wakeup call for both the Middle East and the international community. In addition to bringing the region to the precipice of open state-on-state conflict for the first time in nearly half a century, it also highlighted the increasing importance of an integrated air-defense strategy in the Gulf. There is now a motivation and opportunity to address this long-standing gap in combined capability against air threats becoming more pronounced and severe.

As regional chiefs of defense gather in the coming weeks, we should watch for three areas indicative of positive change to address this long-standing shortfall.

First, there must be an honest assessment of air-defense capabilities and needs across the Gulf countries. The missile and drone threat from Iran is a serious one. As a result, the Gulf states must come to a consensus on interoperable systems that provide exquisite situational awareness, early warning, and effective shootdown capabilities. The United States must ensure that the best American systems are considered in this mix -- more rapidly and responsively than we have in the past. Good, integrative technology in the hands of well-trained partners can make up for the downsizing of US forces in the region and place the emphasis where it needs to be -- on effective regional self-defense.

Second, there must be a commitment to better information sharing among all the Gulf states, as this has historically been a problem. Too often, the United States plays the role of information broker. The essential issue here is trust between all the Gulf states. A good way of moving forward would be to agree on creating an Arab state-generated ""common operational picture"" to which Western military capabilities (eventually including Israel) could contribute. A common Gulf air operations center and exchange of liaison officers would also be good indicators of progress.

Finally, there must be an effort to create, sustain, and expand processes among the Gulf states to operate more effectively. One way to do this is to build on the developing ""missile conferences"" to address anomalies in the air environment and strive to share information and devise action plans. Having effective processes and approaches is a critical way for military organizations to build confidence in themselves while at the same time promoting trust with their partners.

The motivation to address this long-standing shortfall in defense capability is clear and present -- let's hope the Gulf countries take advantage of this and move forward with true integrated capability.

On May 23, as US President Joe Biden welcomed his Kenyan counterpart, William Ruto, for a state visit, the White House took a major step toward cementing the 60-year-old bilateral relationship between the United States and Kenya. By pledging to designate Kenya as a Major Non-NATO Ally, a first for a sub-Saharan African country, the US sent a resounding message of trust in the region. This crucial move not only boosts Kenya's stature as a key US ally, but also marks a turning point for the Biden administration's faltering ""partner-led, US-enabled"" policy toward the continent. With regional players in Africa gravitating toward multilateralism through the BRICS bloc led by China and Russia, the US has found itself on the back foot, especially in light of South Africa's support for Russia in the Ukraine war and opposition to US policy on the war in Gaza. Russia's influence has also been steadily growing in West Africa and the Sahel, with the junta in Niger kicking out US troops despite Washington's construction of a more than $100 million drone base to aid in the fight against terrorism and its provision of military assistance. Even Djibouti, home to US Africa Command's main base in the Horn of Africa, has refused to allow American forces to launch strikes from its territory against the Houthis amid their ongoing attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. But in this hour of uncertainty, the US has found strong support from Kenya, and it is clear that its partnership with Nairobi will extend far beyond the African continent.

Kenya stood strong with the US amid difficult times, lending support during Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine by participating in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and abiding by the US-imposed Russia sanctions, even at the cost of millions in lost trade and concerns over food security. Kenya has also shown its commitment to global security by deploying 1,000 special forces police to Haiti to lead a United Nations-backed international mission and joining Operation Prosperity Guardian, the US-led multinational maritime security effort formed in December 2023 to respond to the Houthi attacks on Red Sea traffic.

In stark contrast, Djibouti, once hailed as a key part of the US's War on Terror, has now become its most unreliable partner in the region. This is exemplified by its disregard for US concerns, such as allowing an Iranian spy ship to dock off the coast from a Chinese military base in Djibouti, potentially providing vital intel to the Houthis. Djibouti's lack of cooperation has only further underscored Kenya's position as a reliable and trustworthy regional partner.

The US's initial plans to establish a military base in Berbera, Somaliland, were thwarted due to Somalia's ongoing proxy war with Somaliland. This was a result of President Biden's failing Africa policy, which prioritizes a ""one-Somalia"" approach through ""partner-led, US-enabled"" efforts, further complicated by the Ethiopia-Somaliland maritime access deal. With the looming eviction of US troops from Niger, Kenya is the most economically and politically feasible option to rehouse them. Indeed, President Biden seem to have already taken a proactive step in that regard by initiating a new military base in Wajir County, Kenya, alongside the existing base in Manda Bay, to accommodate them. With Sub-Saharan Africa facing numerous security challenges, from the ongoing civil war in Sudan and the precarious peace in Ethiopia to the instability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as across West Africa and the Sahel, Kenya's significance as a Major Non-NATO Ally and a reliable regional partner cannot be overestimated.

Moving forward, President Ruto will have to manage issues as varied as dealing with the withdrawal of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia and potential resulting resurgence of al-Shabaab, handling the warring factions in the Congo, finding a win-win solution for Ethiopia's maritime access issue to address its dispute with Somalia, managing the delicate alliance between Somalia and Turkey, and contending with the ongoing civil war in Sudan -- not to mention the looming uncertainty of the upcoming US election in November.

Decreases in demand follow the EU Council Regulation's coordinated reduction measures passed in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

As of 2022, natural gas and electricity made up two-third of the EU's energy portfolio, with renewable energy representing a growing tenth.

The EU imports 90% of its natural gas, but decreased the fuel's imports by 18.4 million terajoules last year, about 20% of 2022 rates.

A measurement of energy consumption, one terajoule equals one trillion joules.

The EU's highest producers of natural gas, the Netherlands and Romania, each produced more than 350,000 terajoules in 2023, just about enough energy to satisfy demands from Hungary or Austria. Germany produced 143,532 terajoules of natural gas last year, about 3% of its nearly 3 million terajoule demand.

The five nations that use the most natural gas all reduced consumption last year, with Germany reducing the fuel's use by 2.96 million terajoules, nearly 4% of overall demand compared with 2022. At the same tine, Italy cut its own natural gas budget by 10%, and France by nearly 12%, each adding up to more than a million terajoule reduction.

Only six member states reported increased natural gas use last year, with Finland's use jumping more than 25% and Sweden's by 11%.

In all, demand for natural gas dropped nearly 20% over the last two years, 13% in 2022 and a further 7% in 2023. The EU required 12.72 million terajoules fewer last year, compared to the year prior.

Last year's levels of natural gas demand are the lowest in a decade, and comparable to rates of usage in the mid-1990s.",europesun.com,news,europesun.com,,0.2549019607843137,454617550,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/OTg1M2QxMzEtZDZ.jpg,

To respond to it and achieve green and low-carbon transition, it calls for support from more quality production capacity.

The new energy production capacity around the world today falls significantly short of meeting the demand of the market, especially huge latent demand in developing countries.

The narrative of so-called ""overcapacity"" in China's new energy industry as well as the protectionist measures stemming from it hinder the development of green industries of the world and the concerted efforts made by the international community to respond to climate change.

The development of China's new energy industry has made significant contributions to the global green and low-carbon transition, in response to the needs of countries to alleviate energy crises and address climate change.

In 2022, China's exports of wind power and photovoltaic products resulted in a reduction of approximately 573 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions for other countries.

According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, over the past decade, the average cost of electricity per kWh from wind power and photovoltaic projects around the world has cumulatively decreased by more than 60 percent and 80 percent respectively, and a significant portion of this achievement is attributed to China's innovation, manufacturing, and engineering projects.

China's green capacity has brought positive spillover effects to other countries. In Kazakhstan, the 60MW Shelek Wind Farm invested and built by a Chinese company helps reduce over 160,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions on an annual basis. In the United Arab Emirates, the Al Dhafra Solar Project contracted by a Chinese company supplies electricity to 200,000 households and reduces carbon emissions by 2.4 million tons each year.

The claim that China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity just cannot hold water.

In order to achieve the temperature goals set out in the Paris Agreement and help countries fulfill their commitments to peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, it is needed to increase investment in the clean energy sector and enhance the supply of new energy products globally.

For instance, the new energy vehicle (NEV) industry is seeing a huge demand globally. According to the International Energy Agency, the global demand for NEVs is expected to reach 45 million units by 2030.

Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto pointed out that overcapacity doesn't exist, and there is indeed a lack of capacity.

China's green capacity poses no threat to the development of other countries' industries. Instead, it promotes their industrial growth through extensive cooperation and healthy competition.

According to Peter Fischer, chief economist of the Swiss daily Neue Zurcher Zeitung, it is with China's assistance that the West has gained access to more cost-effective solar panels and wind turbines. Furthermore, China's innovative NEVs can drive the transformation of European car manufacturers, which ultimately benefits consumers.

An article on the website of The Diplomat said that Southeast Asian nations are actively courting Chinese electric vehicle companies in a collaboration that not only strengthens the imperative transition away from fossil fuel vehicles, but also fuels economic growth through technological exchange.

It is contradictory to emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change while labeling China's renewable energy industry as ""overcapacity."" Such accusations of ""overcapacity"" are merely excuses for protectionism. Facts have long indicated that such practice benefits no one and will eventually backfire.

Adopting protectionist policies and setting up trade barriers not only disrupts the global investment landscape of green industries but also hampers the efficient allocation of green resources worldwide.

This leads to inefficient capacity and redundant construction, increasing the cost of low-carbon transition in countries that adopt these policies. Furthermore, it will hinder the global development of clean energy and impose significant negative impacts on the world economy.

As Bloomberg recently argued, despite implementing steel protectionist measures over the past decade, Washington has failed to prevent the decline in employment within the U.S. metal manufacturing industry. Instead, these measures have increased costs in other sectors of the U.S. economy and reduced competitiveness of the industry. If these measures were to be applied to the new energy sector, they would further weaken America's ability to tackle climate change.

Blocking technological progress and suppressing high-quality production capacity is not the right path for economic development. China stands by its basic national policy of opening up and is ready to work with all parties to uphold fair competition and benefit from cooperation together.

It is hoped that relevant countries will maintain an open mindset, abide by market economy principles and international economic and trade rules, and provide a fair, transparent, open, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises.

The 4,040 solar panels were installed by Budaörs-based Forest-Vill Ltd, which will install an on-site energy storage system in the next phase of development.

The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and will provide a significant portion of the Tápiószele plant's energy needs from renewable sources, according to a press release sent to the Budapest Business Journal.

An important milestone in Ganz's energy efficiency investment in Tápiószele was reached in May 2024, when the 2 MVA solar power plant park was completed on the site of the company's main production facility. As part of the Factory Rescue Program, the company has started to improve the energy efficiency of its transformer factory and turn it into a modern production facility.

The construction of the solar power plant, implemented as part of the Energy Use Optimization Program launched in 2023, was carried out by the Budaörs-based company Forest-Vill Ltd, which installed 4040 solar panels on an area of 3.7 hectares.

The planned annual energy production of the solar PV system is 2,830 MWh, which will cover a significant part of the site's annual electricity consumption of 3,500-3,600 MWh.

The manufacturing company is currently able to use around 60% of the electricity generated by the small-scale solar power plant, but the use of the solar farm can be increased by installing drying technologies using natural gas, electrifying the heating of the production halls and integrating additional electricity consumers.

This will be helped by the fact that the two companies will continue to work together after the completion report, as Forest-Vill has also committed to installing a hybrid system of lithium-ion and so-called NAS battery energy storage on site. The hybrid system will be able to operate the two technologies in parallel, combining the high charge/discharge capacity of lithium-ion batteries with the longer-lasting capacity of NAS batteries. The two systems have a combined capacity of 5.2 MWh.

This will also allow Ganz to store some of the electricity generated locally from solar power and use it at off-peak times. Forest-Vill has begun the design work, with preparation and installation of the energy storage systems to take place by the end of the year. Once the completed systems are commissioned, the next major task will be to optimize the power generation, use and storage, as well as operation on site, which will be completed in 2025.

""The Energy Use Optimization Program is an important milestone in Ganz's development. In addition to improving our products and manufacturing, our priority is to optimize the operation of the factory and make it sustainable. By building a solar farm, we will significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and take a big step towards our goal of zero emissions. Forest-Vill's expertise will help Ganz achieve its sustainability goals and increase the competitiveness of our products in the international market."" said Gergely Gál, managing director of Ganz Transformers and Electric Rotating Machines Ltd.

In addition to the solar power plant, the program includes other improvements that will help Ganz increase the energy efficiency of its transformer and rotating machine plants in Pest County. Besides the installation of new state-of-the-art machines, the company will further reduce its gas consumption by insulating the factory halls and service buildings. Thanks to the programme, Ganz plans to reduce its CO²emissions by almost 40% by the end of 2024.

""In recent years, solar power generation in Hungary has reached unprecedented levels, and this trend is not over yet. Now advanced energy storage technologies make it possible to use the electricity generated by solar panels at night. We are proud to work with one of Hungary's leading manufacturers and to support Ganz's sustainability goals,"" said Csaba Németh, managing director of Forest-Vill Ltd.

Forest-Vill has extensive experience in the development and construction of electricity grids and has grown dynamically in recent years to the point where, in addition to its core business of building substations, it can now also undertake the construction of high-performance solar farms from design to full implementation, relying primarily on its own pool of experts. The company also has extensive experience in the construction of electricity storage facilities, including the design and full construction of the country's largest 20 megawatt energy storage to date with a capacity of 60 megawatt-hours in Szolnok.",bbj.hu,news,Budapest Business Journal,,0.4666666666666666,454594654,23,https://bbj.hu/uploads/banners/20245/ganz_solar park_01.jpg,eng-9598435

Companies would be largely free to rely on carbon offsetting to back up their claims to be climate friendly, under a leaked draft inter-governmental position on a European anti-greenwashing directive, sparking criticism that one set of standards might apply to companies and another to the products and services they sell.

In an updated compromise text, dated 22 May and seen by Euronews, Belgium has made what may be its final attempt to forge an inter-governmental position on a proposed Green Claims Directive before it hands over the rotating presidency of the EU Council to Hungary in July.

A key sticking point over months of back-room talks has been the extent to which offsetting, where firms buy tradable carbon credits to balance their greenhouse gas emissions, should be permitted to back up corporate claims regarding their climate impact.

The European Parliament has agreed such offsetting should only be used for 'residual' carbon emissions - those that remain when a firm has exhausted all practicable means to reduce them in-house.

However, the latest draft suggests member states may push for broader opportunities to use certified carbon credits - whose advocates say reflect and promote genuine climate mitigation measures such as renewable energy deployment or reforestation projects - when they enter final-stretch negotiations with MEPs.

However, with even the Parliament permitting a limited use of offsetting, the Green Claims Directive looks set to be at odds with separate rules on environmental claims related to products and services, adopted in March and banning any climate-friendliness assertions, from bananas to budget flights, that are based on carbon offsetting.

This raises the possibility of a situation where a company is banned from selling 'low carbon' or 'green' flights based on offsetting, but could assert in its advertisements that the corporation as a whole has reduced its carbon footprint or is on a path towards 'net-zero' - a pledge that has been made by everyone from tech giants to flat-pack furniture makers and big oil.

""Carbon offsetting doesn't magically erase emissions - it simply greenwashes them using an accounting trick,"" said Margaux Le Gallou, a specialist on greenwashing practices at the Brussels-based Environmental Coalition on Standards, an NGO. ""If the Council allows the use of carbon credits without limits, companies will have little incentive to reduce their emissions.""

""The Green Claims Directive must align with the science and EU climate commitments under the Paris Agreement by banning the use of carbon credits for everything beyond residual emissions,"" le Gallou told Euronews.

But is not all good news for companies, notably petroleum firms: the compromise text adds a definition clarifying that a company's total carbon footprint would be based on scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

The climate pledges of most petroleum firms are based on scope 1 and 2 emissions, meaning greenhouse gases emitted directly by the firm, and those related to the energy it consumes, for instance through electricity from a coal- or gas-fired power plant. Scope 3 covers emissions only indirectly linked to a company, including the end use of its products.

The compromise text was due to be discussed by national delegates in a Council environment working group today (28 May). The Belgian presidency hopes to schedule it for adoption by senior diplomats on 5 June, then environment ministers at a 17 June summit.

New analysis shows that a combination of regulatory and market-based instruments, together with financial and other support schemes, has led to significant progress being made across much of Central and Eastern Europe in phasing out fossil fuels in favour of renewables. 'Prosumers' -- private households with wind and solar installations, in particular play a key role.

A report published this week by Bankwatch, a network of grassroots, environmental and human rights groups across Central and Eastern Europe, suggests that the EU's Green Deal, and its approach of combining a lift in climate ambition with new financial and other support instruments, has started to change the perception of the CEE region as a laggard when it comes to clean energy transition.

Ahead of two CEE presidencies of the European Council (Hungary and Poland), the new European Commission should now build on this progress and step up its support for the energy transition in CEE countries, the report, which analyses progress made in eight CEE countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia) over the last five years, argues.

The Green Deal is one of the greatest legacies of the current Ursula von der Leyen Commission (2019-24). A firm priority introduced at the inception of the Commission's term with strong political leadership, it has been followed up with multiple strategies and pieces of legislation. It has given the EU a solid impetus to tackle important environmental challenges such as climate change or biodiversity loss.

However, the Commission's mandate comes to an end in 2024 with most climate policies adopted. While debate remains about the level of ambition that will eventually have been achieved, the time has come to implement the new standards to make sure the EU's 2030 climate objectives can be fulfilled.

It will be the task of the incoming Commission to ensure consistent implementation across Europe. Particular focus will need to be on those countries and regions where challenges are higher than elsewhere, due to a higher reliance on fossil fuels or a lack of political support to change.

That is the case in many Central and Eastern European countries. The region is dependent on the EU to advance the climate agenda, with EU policies, funds and other tools instrumental in driving the transition.

EU funds also help to drive policy change thanks to financial support for specific clean energy measures. The post-pandemic recovery fund helped to make some CEE countries commit to phasing out coal by a certain date while providing the funds needed for introducing renewables and improving energy efficiency.

More recent events, particularly the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, also had a major impact on the latest developments in the CEE region, disrupting the energy system.

However, important challenges remain to CEE countries embarking on a lasting energy transition, not the least of which is governments continuing to plan for a high reliance on fossil gas.

Plans for new nuclear meanwhile compete with a faster rollout of renewables and energy efficiency measures, and there are technical difficulties in integrating renewables into the grids.

Then there are those governments that are simply reluctant to fully embrace climate objectives, putting the transition in serious jeopardy.

To overcome these challenges, Central and Eastern Europe needs to play a central role in the next phase of the European Green Deal that will be shaped by the next European Commission. A failure to do so would come with serious risk, as the strongest political opposition against the European Green Deal often comes from this region.

A successful contribution of the region to Europe's energy transition is especially important given the central role it plays in other areas: first and foremost security -- being on the front line of a hostile Russia -- but also in terms of its contribution to the EU's economic competitiveness through key sectors such as IT.

The Commission will start its mandate and propose new priorities concurrently with two Council presidencies from the CEE area: Hungary in the second half of 2024, and Poland in the first part of 2025. These presidencies offer an occasion to put the spotlight on the region and make sure climate action is enabled to the fullest extent there.

However, both countries present problems. While Hungary's political ambition for the energy transition is underscored by a goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, enshrined in a 2020 law, its National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) presents weak interim targets, prioritising gas and nuclear power.

Political decisions, such as the construction of combined cycle gas turbine plants and reliance on Russian fossil gas imports, hinder a robust energy transition, suggests Bankwatch.

Furthermore, Hungary relies on EU funds to roll out its energy transition. However, the government's uncooperative attitude to the EU, including its rule of law conditionality mechanism, is putting these funds into jeopardy, impacting crucial energy transition initiatives.

Other challenges in Hungary's energy transition landscape include the dominant influence of major industrial actors shaping government policies, hindering the move towards a carbon-neutral and decentralised energy economy. Limited freedom of information and government control over media further impede meaningful public discourse on the energy and climate crisis.

Poland has the highest share of fossil fuels in its power mix, mainly coal and lignite, out of the eight countries profiled at 72.9 per cent of its electricity mix in 2023. It has yet to set an end date for the phase out of coal.

However, some progress has been made even under very difficult circumstances with the previous conservative populist Law and Justice (PiS) government signalling severe unwillingness to engage in any dialogue regarding the phase-out of coal before 2049.

Nevertheless, renewables increased in their share of power generation by 74 per cent between 2019 and 2023, and there is hope that the new Polish government will set much more ambitious energy transition targets. The country's new Secretary of State for Climate Urszula Zielińska said in January 2024 that the new government plans to set an end date for coal.

Another report published this week, by Beyond Fossil Fuels and Polish Green Network meanwhile reveals that Polish energy communities eager to deploy more solar are being stymied by a combination of push-back from established state-owned energy companies, a lack of financial support, inadequate grid infrastructure, and a web of regulatory uncertainties.

As a result, although Poland's solar capacity has more than doubled in the last three years, only 30 of the EU's 9,000 energy communities are located in Poland.

Poland's installed solar capacity surged to over 17 GW in 2023, making it the fourth-largest solar market in the European Union with over 1.3 million micro solar installations contributing to the energy mix. But the Energising Communities: Transforming Poland's Power Sector with Locally-owned Renewables report finds that despite the immense public appetite for solar, communities that seek to combine their resources and launch an energy cooperative face a needlessly tough operating environment.

""Energy communities consistently tell us they're eager to seize the potential of solar power to reduce energy bills, create local jobs and cut air pollution. They also recognise that decentralised solar systems have been far more effective in the context of Russia's onslaught in neighbouring Ukraine than the centralised power system,"" says Michal Zablocki from Beyond Fossil Fuels.

""But these voluntary, community-based initiatives face an uneven playing field due to the presence of large state-owned power companies, and must overcome numerous funding, grid-connection and regulatory hurdles.""

Twenty years after the first wave of EU enlargement to the East, there is still significant fragmentation between EU countries when it comes to decarbonising national energy systems.

The energy transition in CEE countries has made progress; indeed, some CEE countries such as Latvia and Romania are now front runners in renewable energy deployment.

However, barriers to a net zero energy system in all CEE countries remain -- many of them political. Governments still do not consider the energy transition a priority, with long-term strategies and policy frameworks missing.

The Hungarian and Polish European Council presidencies present the region with a chance to shine -- but it remains to be seen if the governments of the two countries will make the most of the opportunity.

Do you share this existential concern?

Yes, Europe is mortal. It is important to remember this, especially at a time when its values are under attack. They are under attack from outside, if we think of the war in Ukraine, the challenges posed by Russia's interference and the actions of foreign powers trying to influence our democratic elections. But they are also being challenged from within: we see it in the European Parliament and in some Member States, with governments trying to oppose or undermine the foundations of the European Union. These attempts could succeed if we are not strong enough to counter them. Imagine a European Union in which we could no longer move forward, in which we could no longer define new projects, despite not being satisfied with the status quo. There are areas in which we might need to go further, such as defence, and areas in which we might need to allow for more national flexibility, such as agriculture. If we don't question the situation, if we don't manage to set a course, we shall be heading for disaster. Europe will not survive if it does not evolve.

Against this backdrop, the forthcoming European elections will be particularly important. And they could result in a clear upsurge for the far right...

The far right is on the rise, not everywhere, but in France in particular, as well as in countries such as Portugal, which until now have been relatively unaffected by this phenomenon. In Italy, it has shifted from one party to another, in a system of communicating vessels: Giorgia Meloni is riding high, but she is taking votes from the League (Lega). This development is clearly worrying. The more extremists there are in Parliament, the more complicated it will be to build or find compromises to advance the European cause.

Even if the majority remains pro-European, should we expect the next Parliament to become more right-wing?

The pro-European right is sometimes tempted to imitate the far right because it thinks it can win back its electorate. However, the French example has clearly shown that this does not work. Moreover, pro-Europeans are in the majority in most of the Member States: now they must go out and vote. Abstention is a huge problem because it allows extremists to win more seats. I do not agree that we should take it for granted that the far right will get stronger in the next elections. Look at Germany. When people heard about the AfD's (Alternative für Deutschland) conference on ""remigration"", the plan to expel all foreigners and German citizens of foreign origin, there were massive demonstrations in the streets, and awareness was triggered among the population. As a result, the far right is declining in the opinion polls. We have to fight, because if we give up, we have already lost. All democrats obviously stand in solidarity with our colleague Matthias Ecke, who was attacked in Dresden. This shows that democratic gains are under pressure. As democrats, we support each other in the face of extremist attacks.

The Renew group, to which your party the FDP (Freie Demokratische Partei) belongs, could lose its position as the third party in the hemicycle. Is one of the reasons for this the divisions within the European liberal family?

I do not agree with the narrative that Renew is divided. All the political groups are divided and Renew is no more divided than the others. The Socialists are divided on agricultural issues, the Christian Democrats on economic issues, not a single group in the European Parliament agrees on everything. And that is normal, because MEPs come from different countries, different cultures and different national situations. Renew is present in 24 out of 27 countries, so sometimes there are divisions within the group on certain issues, and some MEPs do not vote in the same way as the rest of the group. But it is extremely united on the fundamentals that led to its creation, namely a very humanist approach to politics and a belief that Europe should be competitive and economically strong.

What makes the FDP unique within Renew?

As elected liberals, we have a particular position; whereas in some countries there is a social liberal party and also a right-wing liberal party, the FDP unites the two. We are generally further to the right than our French colleagues on economic issues and further to the left than them regarding social questions. We place high value on freedom in both an economic and a societal sense. For example, we are in favour of same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples, we are in favour of liberalising cannabis, and we have rather liberal positions on immigration. On this subject, we are in favour of economic immigration to make up for labour shortages. We also have a humanitarian responsibility towards those who are persecuted in their own countries and fleeing war. But we must send back those who do not respect the rules of our countries, who do not have the right to stay or who do not want to integrate, as well as criminals.

You are standing again in the European elections. What are your priorities for the next term?

The first is to take Europe forward regarding defence. This is obviously closely linked to the war in Ukraine, because this has highlighted that we are still partly dependent on aid from the United States. But we do not know what will happen in the forthcoming American elections. I believe, and this is the FDP's programme, that Europe must be more sovereign when it comes to military capabilities. This means more investment in this area, more cooperation between Member States, including in the training of troops and soldiers in the use of drones and other new technologies. The first objective would be to be able to rapidly deploy troops in the field, but in my opinion, we should go further and set ourselves the long-term goal of creating a European army. Such an army should then be equipped with a common command placed under the control of the European Parliament: this would probably be an unthinkable prospect for the French, but it is shared by the German political parties who want a European army. Germany has a complicated history, and one of the lessons it has learnt is that we must not place all the power in the hands of one person who decides everything.

Emmanuel Macron supports a European preference for military purchases in Europe and defends the idea of a European defence loan. What do you think of these ideas, which are not by any means unanimously supported in Germany?

The question of a European loan remains complicated for the Germans, because for us the European Union should not go into debt. Having said that, the idea of a European defence loan requires debate, because we need investment and therefore money. As for a European preference for military purchases, we could subscribe to it, but not immediately, because the most important thing right now is not to buy European but to help the Ukrainians. If, for example, we need to buy arms or munitions and they are not available in the EU, then we should buy them elsewhere. But in the long term, if we can achieve sufficient production capacity in Europe and perhaps even support European champions, let's go for it. I do not believe, however, that we should abolish all competition in the armaments sector. Airbus would not be as good as it is without competition from Boeing. I would also say that ""European preference"" should not end up as ""let's buy French"" or ""let's buy German"". Behind all this is an industrial strategy that should not be guided by national, but by European interests. We need to speed things up and find a common path. Member States, however, have different sensitivities on the subject: four of them are not members of NATO and neutrality is part of the Irish Constitution. To move forward more quickly on defence, we need to see if we can't, as we did with the euro or Schengen, deepen cooperation with many countries, but not with 27.

What about the Franco-German dimension?

We cannot do without it. Europe will only move forward if France and Germany agree and show the way.

Is Europe up to the requirements, the risks and the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine?

Europe reacted quickly, and well. But it must not slacken in its efforts; it must continue. There are strategic and military needs, such as the Patriot or Taurus missiles, for which we must do more and respond to the requests of the Ukrainians. In the end, the Ukrainians are defending our European Union and our freedom. I don't believe at all in the theory that if Putin were to win in Ukraine he would stop there. No, he would not stop there, he would continue, including in EU countries. Our colleagues in the Baltic States are afraid, deeply afraid. Putin is uncontrollable, so nothing can be ruled out. That is why Ukraine must absolutely win this war.

In addition to defence, you mentioned other priorities for the next term of office ...

The second one is competitiveness. We need to be very clear on this point: it has not been a priority during Ursula von der Leyen's term of office. We need to change our approach on this issue and tackle European bureaucracy, excessive documentation and reporting requirements as a matter of priority. We shall need proposals from the European Commission after Ms von der Leyen's departure.

Are you suggesting that Mrs von der Leyen might not be reappointed to head the Commission?

Look at the Sorbonne speech, Emmanuel Macron wants to change the narrative of Europe. When he wanted to change the narrative of his government, what did he do? He changed Prime Minister! And there's the answer. The EPP will retain the Presidency of the Commission. But I'd be happy to have someone else in the job. Mrs von der Leyen is very good at representing the European Union on the world stage, but her first task is to advance European law, and she has not focused on the right priorities. Admittedly, she talked more about defence when the war broke out in Ukraine, which is a good thing. But she has failed to change course on competitiveness issues, and she has let Frans Timmermans[1] continue as if nothing were wrong. Companies from third countries, particularly multinationals, are not investing enough in Europe because the rules are too strict. So, in the long term, we run the risk of losing jobs, particularly in industry, and of losing income, and therefore the opportunity to invest in social welfare, education and so on. So, the lack of foreign investment in Europe is a real problem. One of the major challenges of the next mandate will be to apply the rules we have adopted. For example, we need to see whether the implementation of the Green Deal is in keeping with expectations, or whether we need to reassess the rules. Regarding the end of the internal combustion engine in 2035, for example, we should see whether the projections come true, and ask ourselves what we have to do if they do not. Will we have to distribute more aid, invest more in research, impose constraints on Member States? Electric car charging points are mainly being built in three countries: the Netherlands, Germany and France. What are the countries doing? What do we need to do to make it work elsewhere? There is a real East/West divide on this issue.

Should we not rethink the common trade policy to adapt it to new geopolitical constraints?

Europe's economic success is based on trade. So, the right response cannot be to have less trade. On the contrary, we need to forge trade agreements with our strategic democratic partners around the world. If we don't manage to do this with the United States, Canada or Australia, it will be a failure. It is imperative that we move forward on this.

It is not necessarily a question of trading less, but of doing it differently, by insisting on mirror clauses, reciprocity, fair manufacturing conditions, etc.

We need to improve the rules and conditions of production in terms of labour law, ecology and the fight against climate change. But what does a mirror clause mean -- asking third countries to apply exactly the same rules as the European Union? It is a little naive to think that this would be possible. A great deal of progress can already be made with the certification of production conditions. We also need to combat unfair competition, such as that from Chinese electric cars, which are heavily subsidised. But China is the biggest market in the world, and it is important for our companies to be able to export there. I wouldn't say that everything is simple and easy when it comes to trade, so we have to try to resolve the problems by relying on the WTO and the international rules to which we have subscribed. Another factor weighing on European competitiveness is the excessive price of energy. As a German liberal, I agree with Emmanuel Macron on the nuclear issue. The does not mean discussing old power stations that have been closed down, but about a new way of producing electricity, thanks to smaller plants that use technologies in which Europeans are at the cutting edge. Fear of nuclear power is deeply rooted in German society and there is currently no appetite to invest in this area. Other countries have decided to hedge their bets on it. That is their right and, alongside renewables, it is an option that should not be neglected in Europe because it is a carbon-neutral form of energy. Even though we should not ignore the problems of the waste it produces ....

And your third main priority?

The third aspect is the defence of the rule of law against those who wish to damage the European cause. We have to tell the truth: far-right parties do not want to serve the people of Europe, they do not want to serve the European cause, they want to serve their own interests or those of certain third countries. In this respect, they represent a real danger within our continent itself. We must not close our eyes to this. It is very important for the European Union to guarantee the fundamental rights of European citizens, whether with or against their governments. We achieved a major victory during this term of office with the adoption of the conditionality mechanism, which makes it possible to block European funds be granted to states that do not respect fundamental rights and the basic principles of democracy. The countries that are breaching the rule of law in the Union right now are Viktor Orban's Hungary and Robert Fico's Slovakia. I would say that not everything is rosy in Greece either, with members of parliament being spied on by their own government and the freedom of the press diminishing. The situation is not yet comparable to that in Hungary, but we need to be vigilant.

Europe could be enlarged over the next few years to include new countries. Is it ready for this?

We cannot proceed with further enlargements without first making the necessary institutional reforms. The European Union will not be able to welcome other countries as it stands while it is already not functioning correctly with 27 Member States. In particular, we need to get rid of the unanimity requirement. We also need a stronger European Parliament, which can better control the Commission by being able to investigate and summon the Commissioners. We can draw inspiration from many other national parliaments, which have greater rights vis-à-vis their governments than we do.

Is it fair to say, as some believe, that Ukraine was promised membership of the European Union too quickly?

No, because it was the right decision to grant Ukraine candidate country status. This means that we shall be able to help it better. But it will take many years, even decades, for Ukraine to join the European Union.",robert-schuman.eu,news,Fondation Robert Schuman,,-0.04313725490196074,454585796,4,https://server.www.robert-schuman.eu/storage/images/banque/largeur-975/image-illustration-ee1.png,

To note, on December 17, 2022, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania, and Hungary entered into a strategic partnership agreement, outlining plans for the construction of an energy bridge to transmit green energy (electricity sourced from forthcoming wind farms in Azerbaijan) from the Caucasus region to Europe.

Under this agreement, the Black Sea Energy project aims to construct a 1,195-kilometer-long submarine power cable with a capacity of 1,000 MW.

Eventually, this cable is anticipated to facilitate the transmission of up to four gigawatts of green energy from the Caspian region to the EU.

Simultaneously, efforts are underway to explore the establishment of a system for delivering green hydrogen from the Caspian region to the EU alongside this cable.

And today, it was as long, but talking about Ukraine, the Middle East and other issues.

The last days have been horrible for civilians both in Ukraine and in Gaza, in both places.

On both topics, we have been working to try to achieve a united European position, which is not always easy and certainly, much easier on the issue of Ukraine than on the issue of Palestine and Gaza.

On Ukraine, as always, we had a videoconference with the Foreign Minister [of Ukraine, Dmytro] Kuleba who explained [to] us - and his explanations were supported by images - the Russian attacks against the population, specifically against a Kharkiv shopping mall on Saturday and also, the number of civilian casualties. As I said, with some images that were quite shocking - as shocking as the images of the attack against a refugee camp in Rafah, yesterday night.

With [Minister] Kuleba, we discussed about the needs of Ukraine to continue their self-defence, in particular - as you know - air defence systems, in particular more Patriots, and also the lifting of restrictions on the use of Western weapons against Russian military in Russia.

This is a growing debate. More and more, we take very much into consideration the fact that Ukraine has to resist against attacks which have been launched against its territory from Russian territory, and some Member States have been lifting the restrictions for Ukrainians to be able to use their military support to respond to the Russian attacks from the Russian territory, and not only from the Ukrainian territory, occupied by Russian troops.

One specific issue was the catastrophic damages of the electricity grid in Ukraine, which makes them to cut the power in some moments of the day. This is having a high impact, and unhappily it will [have] a high impact in the upcoming winter. We have to go through the summer, but the number of the electric stations and electric capacities destroyed by the Russians is growing.

Putin is talking about peace negotiations, but his armies are launching another offensive against Kharkiv. They are shelling crowded civilian buildings, and try to undermine the upcoming Swiss Summit on Peace.

We fully support this Summit organised by Switzerland, following a request from Ukraine. The objective of the Summit is to inspire a future peace process. We are working to ensure the broadest possible participation.

In parallel, we adopted the legal acts for the use of extraordinary revenues from Russian immobilised assets. You know that this was politically agreed. Today we approved the legal acts and agreed on my proposal to use 90% of these revenues to [cover] the immediate military needs of Ukraine, through the European Peace Facility.

I will not deny - because I am sure that you already know - that we have had an intense, even heated discussion on this military support for Ukraine, which is facing some obstacles to reach the necessary unanimity to make it effective.

A wide majority of Member States demanded that all pending decisions - and there are quite a lot of pending decisions - to implement the new dedicated Ukraine Assistance Fund under the European Peace Facility, have to be approved soon. In particular, the one that could allow us to use the Russian [immobilised assets'] revenues.

Our leaders gave the political approval to this Ukranian Assistance Fund already in March, and it is still not operational. We cannot let the European Union military support to Ukraine being taken hostage of other decisions, which have nothing to do with this specific issue, especially given the urgency of the situation.

Ukraine needs the arms now, not next year. And we are already in a long delay which has a specific cause, which is the disagreement among Member States - and, in particular, one of them - [about how] to reach the necessary consensus. And today, there has been a strong debate about it.

I hope that at the next COREPER [meeting], this can be solved. I understand they can have concerns and reasons, but the blockage of the decision has to be proportionate to the issue at stake. And in this case, providing military support to Ukraine is one of the most important issues - one of the most important commitments - that we have to fulfil.

I hope that we will soon finalise our long-term security commitments to Ukraine, which will include, in particular, security and defence aspects.

We adopted more sanctions against propaganda entities and individuals, and [we] adopted a new sanctions regime targeting the human rights abuses and repressions in Russia.

We are also paying close attention to the Russian hybrid actions against the European Union and its Member States and look at what could happen in the next European elections. For sure, we will be a target of foreign disinformation and interference.

Estonia reported about the latest border incident caused by Russian border guards - in Estonia, and in other Member States. We expect [from Russia] an explanation about the latest incidents and all Member States expressed their strong solidarity with Estonia and other Member States affected by these actions.

Then, we went to the Middle East. You know that yesterday, we had productive meetings. Today, we were joined by Foreign Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and the Secretary General of the League of Arab States.

Just the fact that this meeting takes place - I think - is an important event. Bringing together to the Foreign Affairs Council, five representatives of the Arab countries and the League of Arab States is an important push in order to increase the cooperation between Europeans and Arabs towards a political solution to the conflict, and increasing humanitarian support for the people in Gaza.

I want to insist, I issued a tweet early this morning about the horrifying news coming out of Rafah, on the Israeli strikes killing dozens of displaced persons. The last figure seems to be around 40 people [killed], including small children being burned. I condemn this in the strongest terms.

It proves that there is no safe place in Gaza. These attacks take place immediately after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered to stop all military activities in Gaza.

Just immediately after, the consequences have been [on the] one side Hamas attacking and launching rockets, and on the other side the intensification of bombing against Gaza. A place where there is no safe place. Attacking refugees camps and killing and burning more than 40 people, among them many children.

You can imagine how horrified we are - all of us - for these sad events. They are more than sad.

Our discussion with the Arab[partners] was a way of understanding their position. They presented us their peace plan. And [we went on] to discuss about how to reinforce our cooperation.

The aim is to work towards a political solution of the conflict. And one of the suggestions and the proposals that the Arab [partners] made us today was to consider the possibility of an International Conference with the title of ""How do we implement the Two-state solution?""

Yes, this should be the purpose. Not to discuss any more about the Two-state solution - ""yes or no"" - because this has been discussed enough, but how to implement it.

This proposal could be merging with the request of the mandate of the European Union Council to hold an international peace conference. We could try to merge the mandate of the European Council with the proposal of our Arab partners.

For the time being, the most important and urgent issue is support to the Palestinian Authority; support to UNRWA; and increasing humanitarian support. It is clear that humanitarian support has been impeded; humanitarian support is blocked at the border. It does not go in.

In some cases, when it goes in, like for example through the [floating] pier - the artificial pier built by the United States - it is being stopped at the pier, because there is no way of distributing it. There is no capacity to distribute it.

So the humanitarian situation is becoming - I am saying that every time I talk to you, but it is true - I cannot imagine how worse it can still become, but it is worse than ever.

We have to intervene and the only thing we can do - we, the European Union - is to participate on the reactivation of the opening of the border in Rafah.

We have been asked for that, I proposed it to the Ministers [for Foreign Affairs], [that] they give me the political green light to reactivate EUBAM [Rafah], our control mission border in Rafah which has been sleeping for years, [so] not active. This could play a useful role supporting the entry of people into Gaza. Enter, in and out.

But this has to be done in accordance with the Palestinian Authority, the Egyptians, and obviously Israeli authorities. We are not going to do that alone, we are not going to be the outsourcers of the security in the border. We are not a security company. We will do that in a clear political understanding of which is the role of the Palestinian Authority in that.

Let's start preparing our capacity to do it if the political conditions are met.

Ministers agreed on reiterating our demand on Israel to implement the International Court of Justice orders, to stop blocking the funding to the Palestinian Authority, and to avoid declaring UNRWA a terrorist organisation and consequently, to prohibit UNRWA to work in Gaza and in the Palestinian territories. These three requests have been expressed in the strongest possible terms, demanding Israel to implement - because the ruling of the Court was putting on Israel some duties, to implement these requirements from the International Court of Justice.

I am not talking about the International Criminal Court, which has still not [pronounced] a ruling, but a demand from the Prosecutor; but the International Court of Justice which is a core entity of the United Nations' system.

The ICJ is the highest court of the UN system. All members of the United Nations have the obligation to comply with these decisions, and we cannot disregard the rules-based world order that we claim every day, that we support and promote everywhere.

We, at the European Union, have been built from the ruins of the Second World War and have always been strong supporter of the International Court of Justice. This is the occasion to emphasize how important it is that the rulings of the Court are implemented.

But as important as this, is to stop the freeze of the tax revenues for the Palestinian Authority. Otherwise, we could melt down the Palestinian Authority, lacking the financial resources to keep a minimum order in the West Bank.

The West Bank is a boiler, and we are not interested in melting down the Palestinian Authority. On the contrary, we have to support the Palestinian Authority, in particular now that the Prime Minister [of the Palestinian Authority, Mohammad Mustafa] came and explained their reforms plans.

Sometimes, we talk about Hamas as if Hamas was the representative of the Palestinian people. It is not. It is the Palestinian Authority who, with all the inconvenience and all the limitations, problems and difficulties, is someone that we recognise that they go to the United Nations to talk to the General Assembly, that come here being invited by us, and [of which] we are the strongest supporter financially. It is the Palestinian Authority.

So, we cannot afford the financial asphyxia of the Palestinian Authority through indiscriminate actions by the Netanyahu government. For now, I will never say again ""Israel"", I will say ""the Netanyahu government"", because it is this government which is taking these decisions.

And these are decisions that could kill the Palestinian Authority, by economic and financial asphyxia.

The Ministers discussed what else we can do, apart from demanding Israel to do these three things, at least.

Finally, the Ministers agreed on something that they rejected at the last Foreign Affairs Council: it is calling for an Association Council with Israel. Something that was not accepted and not agreed in previous discussions, and today it has been agreed because other Member States have been asking for that. We got the necessary unanimity to call for an Association Council with Israel to discuss the situation in Gaza - Israel being represented by the Netanyahu government, obviously - and to discuss the respect of human rights under the obligations that Israel has assumed under the Association Agreement, and how they plan to implement the ruling of the Court.

But what we have seen since the Court has issued its ruling: not a stop of the military activities, but on the contrary, an increase in the military activities, an increase in the bombing and an increase in the casualties of the civilian people, as we have seen last night.

Ministers asked me also to propose further concrete measures to be discussed by the Council to address the situation, because the discussion with the Arab colleagues was very long, very intense. It was a real political discussion, one of the most intense political discussions I have seen in the last four years.

And we were short on time, because I had to go to chair the Syria Conference [Brussels Conference on 'Supporting the future of Syria and the region'] and we have not had enough time to further [exchange] on the analysis of the decisions that we could take in order to address the situation.

For the time being, we have limited ourselves to demand Israel to do these three things, and obviously, to condemn the attacks by Hamas with rockets against Israeli territory.

But I want to stress the importance of the ruling of the International Court of Justice.

The International Court of Justice - I want to repeat it - is at the core of the multilateral system, at the core of the United Nations' system. One cannot defend multilateralism, rule of law at the international level, without being ready to support the implementation of the [International] Court of Justice rulings, which are compulsory for all members of the United Nations.

I am not talking of the [International] Criminal Court (ICC). Yes, you can discuss about it and say ""Well, Israel is not a member, it is not part of the ICC."" It is part of the ICJ. All members of the United Nations have the obligation to fulfil that. And certainly, the [UN] Security Council will have to discuss about what measures can be taken by the United Nations in order to make this court decision be implemented.

Then, we went to Georgia. We had an exchange on developments around the law on transparency of foreign influence in Georgia.

Some Member States considered that they were not so grave, not so important. Others considered - rightly so - that this law is against EU laws and values.

The Venice Commission report was mentioned. In accordance with this Venice Commission, we urge the authorities to withdraw this law.

We have started to consider the most appropriate EU response in case the law is enacted, and take decisions at the next Foreign Affairs Council in June.

But I would like Member [States] to be ready to take decisions every time there is something which does not fulfil our values, which does not [go with] international norms, which does not fulfil the European path - not only in Georgia, but everywhere in the world.

We discussed about the upcoming elections. The Georgian people will have to vote on the trajectory of their country, and government actions may eventually have an impact on the benefits they enjoy as a result of the EU integration. But no decision has been taken.

I debriefed Ministers on Venezuela, and our engagement with Venezuelan authorities regarding a potential deployment of an EU Election Observation Mission. I will communicate about it in due time.

Finally, I was chairing the 8 Brussels Conference on 'Supporting the Future of Syria [and the Region']. I just opened it, and I will go to this Conference again after this press conference ends.

I want to reiterate that the European Union and its Member States have been the strongest supporters of the United Nations Special Envoy [for Syria, Geir Pedersen] and providing a lot of funding to the Syrian refugees and to the neighbouring countries which are hosting them.

The situation is very bad - much worse than last year. When you see the figures of the numbers of the Syrian people who are depending on humanitarian assistance and how many children are among them, and you see the amount of effort that the neighbouring countries have to do in order to take care of these millions of refugees.

We see that there is no improvement in the situation. No, this year is still worse than last year.

So, the international community has to continue providing efforts to support these people in the neighbouring countries, inside Syria and all refugees.

We make a warning about the so-called ""voluntary"" returns of Syrian refugees to Syria. ""Voluntary returns"" means voluntary. The refugees should not be pushed back to Syria, and we should not look to the other side when this happens. And we should not incentivise this by any means.

We consider that there are not [the conditions for] the safe, voluntary, informed, and dignified returns of refugees to Syria for the time being.

This is - I think - everything we have been talking [about] today at the Foreign Affairs Council and at the Syria Conference.

Q&A

Q. Tendría dos preguntas. La primera: cuándo cree que se puede reunir este Consejo de Asociación UE-Israel; si cree que Israel va a asistir - y más dada la escalada diplomática que está teniendo con algunos Estados miembro, sobre todo con Irlanda y con España. La segunda pregunta: ¿si Israel sigue incumpliendo la resolución de la Corte Internacional de Justicia, cree usted o ve ánimo en la sala para que haya sanciones y se puedan aplicar sanciones contra Israel - igual que se hizo con Rusia cuando empezó a incumplir esas resoluciones - o estamos lejos de este escenario?

Gracias. Comprendo que hay una especial atención por parte de la prensa española sobre la reacción que ha tenido el gobierno de Netanyahu a la decisión de España, Irlanda, Eslovenia [y Noruega] de reconocer el Estado de Palestina. Yo no le llamaría diplomática a la escalada. Es todo menos diplomática. Algunas de las cosas que he visto son cualquier cosa menos diplomática. Al contrario, es una agresión verbal absolutamente injustificada y extrema que el gobierno español ya se ha encargado de rechazar.

Con respecto a tu pregunta, para decirle la verdad, hoy no lo he visto. Pero, como les he dicho antes, hoy ha sido un día apresurado en el que hemos tenido que acortar la discusión porque empezaba la Conferencia de Siria. No puedo decirle cuál sería la reacción, en un momento posterior, si Israel - el gobierno de Netanyahu, perdón - continua como está haciendo las últimas horas, haciendo caso omiso de la Corte Internacional de Justicia.

Q. Two questions on Hungary, please. We are constantly hearing new reasons from the Hungarian government why they are still blocking the European Peace Facility (EPF). I am just wondering how you explain that. Is there another reason why they are doing it which they are not naming, and which one could it be? The second question: some Ministers today have raised the question whether it is even necessary for Hungary to agree to all these decisions on the Ukraine Assistance Fund, given that they have secured a drop out, an opt-out for themselves. So, they will not be financing any weapons to Ukraine. My question is: is there a legal pathway to take these decisions without Hungary?

Well, I am not going to speculate about the arguments - the reasons - that one Member may have to support or to justify his disagreement with a legal text. I have seven legal texts pending approval. Seven legal texts pending approval to mobilise resources to support militarily Ukraine. Everybody is saying that we are not fulfilling our commitments, that we are not providing on time our commitments. I have seven legal acts pending approval in order to mobilise about €5 billion to support Ukraine militarily. This delay can be measured in terms of human lives. It is not a financial problem. This is a problem of human lives. And yes, maybe a Member State can have reasons and arguments to disagree on something and to look for other things which are unrelated. But [as] some Member States have said today, it has to be proportional. There has to be a certain degree of proportionality between your concerns - legitimate concerns - and the issues that you are not allowing the others to do.

We have agreed that the Hungarian contribution to the European Peace Facility will not be used to supply military support to Ukraine. This has been already agreed. Their contribution will not be used - not only for non-lethal or lethal - for any kind of military support to Ukraine. But, according to our rules - as far as we interpret these rules, right now - we need unanimityin order to approve these seven pending legal acts. Now it will be the seven legal acts that I need in order to use the revenues from frozen assets and to convert in arms. I will need some more legal acts, and they will be presented to COREPER this week. I do not want to speculate about what is going to be the position of all Member States, but I have been asking them: ""please donot block it."" Otherwise, when we will have the revenue of these assets, we will keep them carefully in our current account.

Q. I would like to follow [up on] the Hungarian issues but from another angle. One general question: the governing parties, the government members and even the Prime Minister [Viktor Orban] himself, claim that the EU policies in Ukraine push the world to the brink of the World War III. I would like to ask your reaction to this. The short question: I am wondering whether the European Union is contemplating the introduction of compulsory military conscription as the [Hungarian] Foreign Minister [Péter] Szijjártó said today in his conference. I am wondering whether he raised this issue in the Council.

La Unión Europea no tiene la capacidad de establecer el servicio militar obligatorio. Estamos muy lejos de tener estos poderes, ¿no?

The European Union has not the capacity to call for a compulsory conscription. We are far away from having this kind of power. This is a national decision. I read in the newspapers that the United Kingdom is thinking about it, but the European Union cannot. I am not even thinking of that because it is far away from our capacities.

About this issue of the policy of the European Union towards the war in Ukraine, this is an interesting [issue] to discuss at the level of [the] European Union´s leaders. This is something that has to be discussed where the leaders of the governments sit and discuss. At our level, [a] much lower, much more modest level, we do not have to discuss these kinds of things. We discuss practical issues. If the Member States decided to create a Fund to support Ukraine - and it was decided, by the way, by the European Council - my duty, and the duty of the Ministers, is to implement it and to overcome the difficulties in order to make this implementation possible.

Philosophical discussions about the Third World War - for sure, important and interesting - were not on the agenda today. Not on my agenda, maybe it could be in another agenda of another institution. Today, [at the] Foreign Affairs Council, the purpose of the discussion was much more grounded [and] lower level: how do we manage to use the resources that the budget has allocated to us.

Q. I would like to have your comment or reaction, if it is possible, if you are aware, about the killing of an Egyptian soldier by the Israeli forces this afternoon and the tensions on the border between the two countries. My question is about the meeting of today. What was the reaction of Member States, after they heard this extensive and comprehensive Arab vision, starting from the ceasefire and the Two-State solution? Can I ask you a clarification? You spoke about the [fact that the] Arab countries asked for a peace conference to look at how to implement the Two-State solution. Are you talking here about the preparatory peace conference or another one?

Bueno, creo que ya se lo he dicho, ¿no? No sé de qué estaba hablando. Estaba hablando de eso, precisamente.

Sobre el incidente al que usted se refiere, no voy a hacer ningún comentario. Si alguien lo tiene que hacer es el ministro egipcio. Sí, hemos sido informados de la tensa situación que hay en la frontera entre Gaza y Egipto. Por eso se nos pide que movilicemos nuestra misión de control de fronteras [EUBAM Rafah]. Se piensa que una misión de la Unión Europea podría actuar con el grado de neutralidad suficiente para hacer ser aceptada por todas las partes.

En castellano se dice ""tirar el guante sobre la mesa"", un desafío. Un desafío constructivo: esto es lo que hoy podría decir resumiendo lo que han hecho nuestros colegas árabes. Nos han tirado el guante sobre la mesa y nos dicen: ""recójanlo ustedes"".

""Están de verdad dispuestos to engage with us, when looking for a solution? To build the Two-State solution that theoretically you support? Are you ready to work with us on this endeavour? Okay, if you are ready, tell us how. How, and not only demanding and asking, but acting. What are you ready to do? Are you ready to engage with us? Here is our plan. What do you have to say about this plan, and [on what do] you agree and [on what do] you disagree?""

This was the purpose of the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to know which were the positions of the Arab countries. Not the League of Arab States, but the ones who came here. Good, now we know. And now they ask us: ""Do you want to engage? Then, how? A suggestion: why don't we organise an International Conference on how to implement the Two-State solution? Would you be ready to participate in that and push for it?""

""Oh, we have the idea of calling for another Conference. Okay, we can merge them. We can do that together.""

These are the questions that today our Arab colleagues have presented to us. The glove is on the table. I hope that we will be able to take the glove, and to give a positive answer to this request. Certainly, there has been the consideration of a double standard, that, yes, we are expressing strong concern but apart from expressing concern there is no action. Apart from the humanitarian side, in which we do a lot. We do a lot, and they thank [us and] they recognise [it]. They thank us: ""yes, you do a lot.""

But the question is not only to provide humanitarian support. It is, when we can, because humanitarian support has been [impeded] - everybody has to recognise it and the Arab states told us clearly: ""Look, do you agree with us on the fact that humanitarian support has been impeded? In an unjustified manner? By whom?"" Well, by the one who controls the border.

People are blaming Egypt about the border in Rafah, but there are many other border points which are under Israeli control, and they are closed. That is a problem, and we have been told: ""What can you do, to try to support more humanitarian support effectively entering and effectively being distributed?""

When I see that today the Israeli parliament - the Knesset - has been starting to study a law to declare that UNRWA will be forbidden to act and work in the West Bank and Gaza, certainly, it is not going to help. Certainly, it is not going to help.

That is why we ask the three things. We demand three things: [first, the] implementation of the International Court of Justice's ruling. There is a lot of things in this resolution, not only to stop military actions, also not to impede humanitarian access. You know what this court ruling says.

Second, to stop blocking the funding to the Palestinian Authority. On which grounds do you take the money of the Palestinian Authority? On which grounds are you going to create a meltdown of the banking system in West Bank? Do you want to bring [it] to the brink of collapse? We do not want [this]. ""Okay, you do not want [this]. What are you going to do in order to prevent it from happening?""

On the third one, it is the issue of UNRWA.

By the way, all Member States have resumed their funding of UNRWA. This week the Commission will disburse the second tranche of support to UNRWA. We are going to pay the tranche due to the Palestinian Authority. But if the Netanyahu government prevents the revenue of taxes that belongs to the Palestinians [from] being received by the Palestinian Authority, who will take [it]? Who will prevent [this] and who will provide the money?",eeas.europa.eu,news,Europa,,-0.1450980392156863,454577174,7,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/themes/custom/eeas_website/img/eu-flag.png,eng-9602099

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, resulting in blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have caused more than $1 billion of damage, leading to the loss of 8,000 MWh of generating capacity from the energy system, the government says.

""The total volume is 16,258 MWh, with a maximum capacity of up to 1,700 MW in some hours,"" grid operator Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app about the amount of energy that could be imported.

It said Ukraine would import electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova.

Ukraine can currently import no more than 1,700 Mwh of electricity from the EU states simultaneously.

Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko told parliament on Friday that Kyiv was negotiating to maximise possible imports of electricity from the EU countries.

The head of Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, said earlier this month that an increase to 2,200 MWh could significantly improve the situation.

Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskiy said last week that 3,500 to 4,000 MWh of interstate interconnector capacity could be installed in the next five years and European grid companies needed to reinforce their substations, install additional transformers, build new transmission lines.

At a press conference after a meeting of his European Union counterparts, Péter Szijjártó said ""the countdown"" to the European parliamentary elections ""is unfortunately bringing about an increase in war sentiment"", with many proposing more money and arms for Ukraine, ""which can only result in further destruction and more deaths"".

He referred to proposals aimed at allowing Ukraine to use Western arms against targets in Russia. ""They talk positively about an initiative for NATO countries to shoot down Russian missiles above Ukraine and, unfortunately, my fellow foreign ministers have not distanced themselves from threats of nuclear war,"" he said, adding that such remarks and ""crazy proposals"" could have ""dangerous and tragic consequences"".

""We don't want to see Hungarians at the frontline of the Ukraine-Russia war, and we do not want young Hungarians to be taken to Ukraine. This isn't our war and we have nothing to do with it,"" Szijjártó said.

""We firmly call on all European politicians mulling mandatory conscription to drop such ideas immediately... Hands off our central European and Hungarians young people,"" Szijjártó said.

Regarding the draft of the 14th sanctions package against Russia, Szijjártó said that it was against Hungary's economic interests in its current form and would also endanger the security of Hungary's energy supply. The government was unwilling to vote for it, he added.

He said the measures would swipe a serious blow to Hungary's agriculture and food industry, and could compromise ""the way Hungary pays for"" its electricity, slow down the Paks upgrade project and violate Hungary' sovereignty concerning the issuance of certain export permits.

He insisted that the previous 13 sanctions packages had done ""a lot more harm to Europe than to Russia"".

On another subject, Szijjártó said Hungary was sticking to its earlier position and would not agree to freeing up a further 6.5 billion euros from the European Peace Facility for arms deliveries to Ukraine.

He said the foreign ministers of Germany, Lithuania, Ireland, Poland and other countries had ""ganged up on him"" at the meeting but ""this hasn't shaken our position"". ""No matter how loud Europe's pro-war politicians shout ... we won't give in to pro-war pressure,"" he said.

He believes that he borrowed the land from his daughter, so he has to do his best to preserve it for the future. Kemencei, 28, and his wife Cintia and their almost two-year-old daughter Boróka moved to the farm near Ladánybene three years ago. They keep horses, pigs and chickens on their four and a half hectares of land, some of which they rent for grazing. A photo series by Reuters.

They don't use pesticides or insecticides, their animals are kept free range and they do as little digging as possible to preserve the structure and moisture of the soil. They grow their own vegetables, get meat by slaughtering their own animals or by trading, and pass the leftovers on to families who have chosen a similar way of life. ""The best thing about this way of life is the freedom,"" Cintia says, ""the fact that we aren't constrained by anything and are our own boss. There's work to be done on the farm every day, regardless of whether you're a man or a woman, things have to be taken care of. ""

According to Kemencei, while total self-sufficiency is an unrealistic goal, they only rely minimally on external resources.

""We didn't inherit this land from our fathers, but are borrowing it from our children, so we are trying to live and cultivate the land sustainably."" - he explains, sitting in their kitchen while a large piece of pork roast sizzles in the oven. Reversing the direction the world is currently going in is no longer possible, he says, but keeping it at the same level is. He would like his child to have the opportunity to grow something besides cacti in her garden, and he believes this is everyone's responsibility.

Although there are no statistics on how many people in Hungary are living this kind of life - many of them deliberately stay away from central institutions - rumor has it that their number is growing.

Many are simply looking to save on costs, while others are looking for an escape from consumerism or simply long for a greener life.

Kemencei estimates the number of families who are striving towards a more sustainable way of life in some way to be around 1000. Some are trying to live consciously on their own, while others are in informal partnerships or are members of structured eco-villages.

Reuters spoke to six other families who have also left their jobs and the organized economy and are growing most of their own food. Some of them have their own water and energy sources.

Ákos Varga and his wife, Gabi were in their late fifties when they sold their IT and solar panel business four years ago to live more freely in Nagyberény, in western Hungary.

Varga believes that the popularity of self-sustaining communities built on mutual trust is going to grow. ""We thought we had achieved everything we wanted in life, and then we asked ourselves if this was true happiness. We couldn't answer with a yes,"" says Varga. ""We wanted to get closer to nature,"" he explains.

Relationships built on trust are also very important to László Kemencei. Through a barter deal, he received a small pot-bellied piglet from a friend, which they subsequently consumed from nose to tail. Another friend of his, a beekeeper, gave him a rooster in exchange for other food items.

""Sometimes we slaughter a few chickens in order to exchange them for something we need, but we only cooperate with places that we know have an approach similar to ours. We try to exchange the chickens for honey or cheese by matching their value. This only works if everyone doesn't produce everything, but whatever they do produce, they do it well,"" he explains.

""We're not trying to change the world, we're not trying to be superheroes, there are plenty of those already. We simply want to produce what we need.""

They are not living totally offline, they do use the internet, electricity and gas for heating. But they get their water from wells, and in the future - as soon as they can afford them - they would like to have solar panels and wind turbines.

Barring any emergencies, they can manage on 250,000 forints (650 euros) a month. They only buy milk, sugar and other basic food items that they cannot produce themselves.

If these plans materialise, they're likely to derail the energy transition in both countries, undermining EU efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

In Bulgaria, OMV Petrom, the Romanian subsidiary of Austrian fossil energy giant OMV, is seeking to resume exploration at the Han Asparuh offshore gas field. The project could pump 13 billion cubic metres (bcm) of fossil gas a year between 2030 and 2040, and 8 bcm a year by 2050. But the company would first need to register a discovery before its license, first granted in 2012, expires at the end of the year.

Since TotalEnergies withdrew from the project earlier this year, following Repsol's exit four years earlier, OMV Petrom is currently the project's only stakeholder. As Bankwatch previously revealed, the Bulgarian government has been actively seeking to acquire its own stake, but thus far without success.

Meanwhile, eager to push the gas project forward, Bulgarian authorities appear to be cutting corners. According to a recent report, plans are underway to 'unite exploration and production licenses under one agreement' in a bid to shorten the period between exploration and production. There are also plans to reduce the time it takes to carry out and appeal environmental impact assessments.

At the adjacent Neptun Deep field, also located in Romanian waters, OMV Petrom, together with Romanian state-owned company Romgaz, could begin drilling for gas even earlier. Set to officially start production in 2027, the project would see 100 bcm of fossil gas extracted over the next two decades. This would make Romania the EU's biggest fossil gas producer. At a time when the country - and the EU as a whole - need to slash fossil gas use, Romania's transmission system operator expects domestic gas consumption to grow significantly.

According to Romania's energy minister, an agreement reached by the Council of the European Union in March urging EU Member States to continue coordinated demand-reduction measures until April 2025 is 'more of a recommendation'. He confirmed Bucharest is intent on increasing fossil gas consumption, and to ensure demand grows, the Romanian authorities are now busy building new gas infrastructure, from power plants to distribution systems.

Although OMV Petrom is still awaiting a crucial environmental permit from the relevant authorities to go ahead with Neptun Deep, which could be issued any day, the future of both the Romanian and Bulgarian fossil gas projects remains uncertain. In Bulgaria, where fossil gas consumption is currently 3 bcm a year, any new fossil gas production would require a substantial increase in either domestic gas consumption or exports.

Yet, there is little appetite in Europe for long-term gas import deals beyond 2035. In fact, if the EU fully implements REPowerEU, its strategy aimed at weaning Europe off Russian gas imports, overall gas demand should halve by 2030. Therefore, given the estimated EUR 4 billion investment in each project, both of these ventures pose not only major climate risks but also economic risks due to the likely insufficient demand for all the gas produced.

In mid-May, the Bulgarian environment ministry held transboundary public consultations over the Neptun Deep project. Local community members, representatives of non-governmental organisations, and officials from both countries were invited to the coastal town of Kavarna to discuss the implications of the offshore gas project. Yet, the discussion was mostly dominated by OMV Petrom representatives, with little intervention from local authorities. Civil society members, including Bankwatch, raised concerns about the project's climate impact, the use of toxic chemicals, and the risk of accidents. But these concerns were largely brushed off by OMV Petrom representatives, who claim Neptun Deep will have no significant transboundary impacts. For their part, the Bulgarian authorities also expressed their agreement with the proposed measures.

Yet, both Han Asparuh and Neptun Deep pose direct threats to EU climate action. The environmental impact assessment for Neptun Deep makes the ludicrous claim that fossil gas drilling would generate 'negative emissions'. However, this claim is based on the assumption that the gas extracted would replace coal in energy production, and that Romania's operating coal capacity is three times higher than it actually is.

In reality, Neptun Deep's climate footprint over its projected 20-year lifespan, including its associated pipeline infrastructure, could reach a staggering 209 million to 227 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), primarily from gas combustion. This equates to around 10 million tCO2e per year, surpassing Romania's current annual coal industry emissions (8.6 metric tonnes in 2022, and decreasing). These findings, taken from a recent report commissioned by Greenpeace Romania, raise serious concerns about the validity of the predicted Neptun Deep figures.

For several years now, civil society have been sounding the alarm over the two projects, their climate price tag and the toll they would take on marine wildlife. In Romania, since the offshore law enabling the Neptun Deep investments was approved in 2022, environmental groups have sent open letters to the Romanian parliament, and warned on ￼￼ occasions of the project.

In late March, Greenpeace activists staged a direct action outside OMV Petrom's headquarters demanding the cancellation of Neptun Deep. A month earlier, Greenpeace filed a lawsuit against the companies behind Neptun Deep and the local environmental protection agency that had approved the project's onshore infrastructure for failing to assess the full scale of its environmental ramifications.

And it's not only activists and non-governmental organisations. Three years ago this month, the International Energy Agency warned that, if the world is to reach net zero emissions by mid-century, there can be no more new oil and fossil gas exploration and production. Failing to do so vastly increases the chances of a full-blown climate chaos. And in a recent report, the OECD concluded that Romania should not approve new oil and gas explorations, since falling gas demand in Europe after 2030 might pose a financial risk for new projects (see page 108). Yet, policymakers in Romania and Bulgaria, much like the profit-driven fossil fuel industry, are evidently looking the other way.

If realised, the Neptun Deep and Han Asparuh projects would cement both Romania's and Bulgaria's dependence on fossil fuels for far longer than the world can afford. While the Romanian government intends to use most of the Neptun Deep gas domestically, there are plans to export Black Sea fossil gas to neighbouring countries, most likely to Hungary and Austria. Under the pretext of energy security, gas exports could mean entrenching the dependence on dirty, expensive fossil gas throughout the region.

To make matters worse, Neptun Deep is being enabled by EU money. While the drilling itself might not be directly in receipt of EU funding, the supporting infrastructure - namely, the pipeline connecting the rig to the national grid, without which the project cannot function - has already received over EUR 230 million via the EU's Modernisation Fund and the European Investment Bank.

EU leaders have repeatedly been speaking of the need for the world to end fossil fuel subsidies. This was also one of the EU's priorities for the UN climate summit in Dubai in November 2023. A month earlier, however, the then Hungarian President Katalin Novak reiterated Budapest's intentions to buy fossil gas from Neptun Deep and called on the EU to finance it.

Sinking public money into any fossil fuel project is effectively stabbing the European Green Deal in the back. EU politicians and institutions should not endorse either Neptun Deep or Han Asparuh. Instead, they should call these projects out for what they really are: climate wrecking balls.

For now, the important decisions are set to be taken at the national level. Both the Romanian and Bulgarian governments need to acknowledge that pumping more fossil gas runs completely counter to the public interest and to immediately withdraw support for these planet-heating follies. In tandem, decision makers must prioritise sustainable energy for their citizens by investing in electricity grids, renewables, and energy efficiency.",bankwatch.org,news,Bankwatch,,-0.03529411764705881,454508057,1,https://bankwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WWW-Use-for-webpage-covers-blog-post-publications-PRs-1-24.png,eng-9614055

""Power supply will be limited for households and industrial enterprises in all regions of Ukraine between 6 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. on May 27,"" the statement said.

""Regional electric companies may resort to hourly power outage schedules if the limits are exceeded,"" Ukrenergo said.

It noted that power supply to critical infrastructure would not be limited.

In turn, media said with the reference to DTEK that power consumption limits in Kiev would be enough to meet 81% of the demand.

According to Ukrenergo, 16,258MW/h of electricity are being imported from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova on Monday, which is a third more than on Sunday.

The company said that the imports might reach the technical capacity of 1,700MW in particular hours. There are no electricity exports, and they are not planned, it said.

Ukraine accepted excessive electricity from Poland between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sunday, May 26, at the request of the Polish electricity system operator, Ukrenergo said.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, resulting in blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have caused more than $1 billion of damage, leading to the loss of 8,000 MWh of generating capacity from the energy system, the government says.

The head of Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, said earlier this month that an increase to 2,200 MWh could significantly improve the situation.

Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskiy said last week that 3,500 to 4,000 MWh of interstate interconnector capacity could be installed in the next five years and European grid companies needed to reinforce their substations, install additional transformers, build new transmission lines.

The head of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, Leo J. Lamberson, is in the center, with Senator Bob Wilson at the left. [MARIA HECKINGER ARCHIVE]

Dear Greece,

You are the land of my birth. Of my mother's birth, and of all the mothers that came before her.

She was unmarried when she became pregnant with me. She was from a small village in the Peloponnese and was therefore unable to keep me. She left, never to return.

I was born in December 1962 in Athens, and adopted from Mitera sometime in 1963/64. My adoptive mother was Greek but had lost her citizenship with her marriage to my adoptive father, a British citizen.

They adopted my brother Alex at the same time.

Both of us have applied to have our citizenship reinstated through our birth mothers who were Greek nationals when they gave birth to us.

My journey away from you was quick. My journey home has taken four years already and I've yet to clear the first hurdle. I submitted my application to the Greek Consulate in London in 2020. I am still waiting for an acknowledgment, for a case number.

Greece. These are my earliest memories of you.

Our house in London, full of exiles. Theodorakis, his musicians, Mercouri and countless others made stateless during the turbulent years of the junta.

I remember also all the long hot summers spent at our beach house near Halkida, where my mother, her sister and two brothers built small houses to accommodate our large extended family. All us children running between them, playing, watching wide-eyed when my uncle brought large blocks of ice wrapped in hessian sacks from the village, then chopped it into chunks and placed in the four iceboxes.

I remember too our small hands carefully carrying the empty ""stamnes"" to be filled from the well - pumped only after 5 p.m., when our sleepy community resurfaced after a seemingly never-ending ""mesimeri.""

We had no electricity back then.

At night we would sing and dance or play cards by the orange light of the oil lamps. Then to sleep in our own beds or top-to-toe if the houses were full of visiting relatives (more often than not); to be woken the following morning by a donkey braying in a far-off field, to sit drinking our milk in the cool shade of the trees, watching as Yiayia started cooking dinner, scooping out the flesh of vegetables into a large bowl, then grating onion, adding herbs, rice and mixing together with the oil harvested from the trees under which we sat.

It is there I learned what family means. What you, Greece means.

It was the summers spent diving for shells and competing to see who could go deepest, burned nut-brown by the sun that sustained, scorched and bonded us forever.

My adopted mother died when I was 14. My adopted father signed over the house to me and my brother and chose a different path, a new wife, a new life. But for us, there was only this life, this family, OUR family and it remains so to this day.

Growing up with two cultures has its challenges. Nowadays they call children like us ""third culture kids."" But then there was no word for it.

In England, we never completely fitted in. We were branded ""Greek"" at the pleasure of whoever, whenever they wanted.

""Don't let her write about Turkey."" I overheard the editor say to no one in particular in my first newsroom job at the beginning of my journalism career. ""She's Greek!""

Meant to defame I suppose, but in truth it made me love you more.

For it was as a journalist that I really got to know you outside of Athens and the community of my summer home.

Over my career I've sat with Greek officials in Phuket City Hall in Thailand, as they tirelessly waited for the handful of Greeks then unaccounted for in the days following the Boxing Day Tsunami.

I have spent weeks outside your parliament, talking to those who'd made their home in Syntagma Square, as successive governments held emergency talks late into the night on the economic crisis and what should be done.

More recently I watched as my fellow countrymen offered water, food, blankets, with an extended hand of friendship on the beach at Skala Sikamias in Lesvos, where 800,000 fleeing war arrived in rubber dinghies.

I have walked with refugees as they made their way through Idomeni, the Balkans, Hungary, Austria and Germany all the way up to northern Finland. I always asked about their journey to reach safety, how it had been, the welcome they received, or lack thereof.

""Yunan, Greece good,"" each would say with a smile and give me a thumbs-up. It filled me with pride.

Greece. Each year as spring turns towards summer my heart is pulled towards you, my homeland. Flights are booked. Friendships dusted off. ""When will you get there?"" we ask each other from across the globe, for we are part of the diaspora that each year comes home to recharge, to take stock and by doing so, live our best lives.

Dear Greece. I have always been told I'm Greek. So do you know what it's like not to be accepted by you?

It's like standing outside of a room, the door locked. I can hear voices inside. They're the voices of my country, talking in my mother tongue. I bang on the door to be let in. Inside they can hear me, but they don't open. I get angry, frustrated and bang louder.

Still nothing, just silence, as if I'm being punished for an unintended sin. So I stop banging and slump to the ground overwhelmed with grief, weeping, deflated, rejected yet again.

For yes, for those of us who are adopted, it's another rejection.

Rejected by our birth mothers, now rejected by the country which gave birth to us.

Dear Greece, agapimeni mou Ellada, I ask that you please, please recognize me as one of your own.

A Jewish University of Virginia student from Israel has filed suit against the school in federal court, claiming he has been the victim of antisemitism on Grounds and that, further, UVa leaders knew and did nothing to stop it.

The wide-ranging suit argues UVa President Jim Ryan and Rector Robert Hardie allowed ""virulent antisemitism"" to run rampant and accuses students of being ""foot soldiers for Hamas,"" the Palestinian Islamist terror group that the Israel has been warring with since Oct. 7 of last year.

The plaintiff, first-year student Matan Goldstein, is suing Ryan, Hardie and two pro-Palestine organizations on Grounds, both of which his suit alleges act as ""sleeper cells"" taking orders directly from Hamas.

PRISON: A raft of hypothermia hospitalizations and other questionable conditions at a Virginia prison uncovered in a recent report deserve further scrutiny, leading Democratic state lawmakers said this week.

Lawmakers pledged to press Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's administration for answers and called for a newly created prisons watchdog to look into the findings of an Associated Press report, which found at least 13 hospitalizations for hypothermia over three years at the Marion Correctional Treatment Center.

The AP also obtained records that showed medical providers expressing concern about temperatures at the prison and another long-tenured employee indicating that he would not be surprised to learn of hypothermia complaints. Previously reported records have detailed allegations that conditions inside the facility were at times so cold, toilet water froze over.

On multiple occasions, Jordan went to the victim's house and had sex with him, prosecutors said.

IN THE NEWS Another scholar leaving Monticello

Another preeminent scholar of early American history will be leaving the nonprofit organization that owns and operates Founding Father Thomas Jefferson's Monticello estate due to friction with its current leadership, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.

The source corroborated previous reporting from The Daily Progress that Frank Cogliano, interim director of the International Center for Jefferson Studies, was offered the role on a permanent basis only to have it rescinded days later.

It is among a number of claims regarding Cogliano that Monticello denies.

Its new president Jane Kamensky, who joined the foundation in January, says she is ""grateful for the dedication and expertise"" Cogliano has brought to the center since he joined last summer.

Despite multiple sources now corroborating the allegations, Monticello spokeswoman Jenn Lyon said, ""The Daily Progress has received bad information.""

RGGI: Gov. Glenn Youngkin's opposition to a multi-state effort to cut greenhouse gases costs Virginia about $150 million a year even after the General Assembly boosted funding for flood control efforts, House of Delegates Democrats say.

In addition, they said Youngkin's veto of a bill that would have let the state tap federal funds for loans with low interest rates to finance clean energy projects, investments in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and similar efforts will cost Virginia still more.

Youngkin said being involved in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which the state left as of the end of last year, would amount to an additional $500 million tax on Virginians' electricity bills as utilities pass on the costs to customers.

The mixed-use Marina City complex will have a 1.2 km-long shoreline on the banks of the Danube. A waterfront, multifunctional promenade and 90,000 sqm of car-free green space will be created. With residential tower blocks reaching 64 meters, most apartments will offer views of the river and the Buda hills.

The investment is put at HUF 400 billion. The project will be served by direct metro connections 10 minutes from the city center and more than 100 shops, restaurants, service facilities, and sports amenities. According to the development plans, more than 2,500 apartments will be built in several phases.

""Since its foundation, Cordia and the Futureal Group have been committed to revitalizing neglected urban neighborhoods,"" Gábor Futó, co-founder of Futureal, said at the cornerstone-laying ceremony for Marina City. Reference projects include Corvin Promenade, Etele Plaza (Hungary's first smart shopping and entertainment center), and the Budapest One office development.

""We are also working on several neighborhood revitalization projects abroad. But we see in this abandoned area a place where buildings have zero local carbon emissions and exceed the strictest, most forward-looking energy requirements. We have envisioned a neighborhood that provides all services locally,"" he added.

Residents of the new scheme will live in an environment that will be entirely car-free as the routes for service vehicles will be underground. A flood protection system is being developed on the site, which will be created by constructing an embankment and applying landscaping elements.

Mayor József Tóth emphasized the role of innovation in District XIII's post-industrialization development through the creation of projects with both residential and business functions and green areas. Futó noted that Marina Center will be next to the river and the Váci út Office Corridor. The site was bought from CIB Bank through an open tender.

""The project consists of several towers along the Danube, the first of which is already under construction and will be completed in two years,"" Futó explained. Around 15 towers are planned, with one launched annually; development will take around 17 years.

""We are able to build 64-meter-high buildings as the built-up density on the site is only 35%, with the rest consisting of green areas. [...] We also have a building permit for around 100,000 sqm of offices. However, if demand is for residential or other uses, we can develop accordingly as the office market currently does not warrant such a large development,"" Futó said.

Heating will be covered by air-to-water and ground-source heat pumps, eliminating the need for natural gas or district heating. Solar panels will be installed on the roofs of residential buildings, supplementing the grid electricity required to operate energy-producing equipment from green sources.

""The reception of our pre-sale campaign has been extremely positive; with nearly 50% of the first-phase apartments already sold, we will soon launch the sale of apartments being built in the second phase,"" said Tibor Földi, president of Cordia International's Board of Directors.

The overall project was designed by the Danish firm Bjarke Ingels Group. Hungary's Garten Studio Kft. is responsible for the landscape design, while Tér-Team Kft. is handling the flood protection system.

Tang Rui, founder and CEO of Shanghai Cantron Robotics, stressed the groundbreaking innovations his company has introduced to the European market.

""What we want to enable is autonomous driving plus combined energy storage to build a mobile energy solution for society,"" Tang told Xinhua in an interview during the conference.

His company's latest product is a Level 4 autonomous driving energy robot equipped with a 104 kWh battery. The robot can be summoned via the Drop'nGo mobile app, offering a convenient charging service that eliminates the need for fixed charging stations.

""Our robot does more than just charging EVs: it can also charge back to the microgrid to help with electricity usage,"" Tang said.

This innovative approach addresses the challenges of infrastructure investment, making it a more cost-effective and efficient solution for accelerating electrification.

Tang is optimistic about the future of his company in Europe. ""The European market is very important for us. Hungary, in particular, is a crucial portal due to its significant battery manufacturing capacity,"" he said.

He emphasized that his company is working with partners in Hungary and other European countries, such as HUMDA, WHB Energy, and IonDynamics Energy.

Meanwhile, chief organizer of the GreenTech conference Karoly Kovacs emphasized the growing importance of Chinese companies at the event, as well as on the broader Hungarian market.

""We have several Chinese exhibitors this year, including major players like Cantron Robotics and BYD. They have brought fascinating innovations such as autonomous electric car charging robots,"" Kovacs told Xinhua.

These robots are not only autonomous but also fully programmable, capable of navigating cities to find and charge electric vehicles before returning to their base.

Kovacs praised the high quality and innovation of Chinese companies' offerings.

""Chinese companies are now at the forefront of innovation across many fields. Their presence in Hungary is increasingly significant, both at the governmental level and among the general public,"" he said.

The Chinese exhibits at GreenTech were interactive, including hands-on demonstrations and presentations.

Kovacs predicted an even stronger presence of Chinese companies at GreenTech events in the future. ""This year, companies like NIO and BYD approached us to participate, showing their keen interest in our conference,"" he said.

Energy Minister Lantos Csaba highlighted Hungary's commitment to enhancing energy security and sovereignty, as it prepares to assume the presidency of the European Union Council in July. ""Our main task will be to restore Europe's competitiveness, particularly in securing energy supply,"" said the minister.

He highlighted Hungary's significant achievements in renewable energy, including over 6.3 GW of solar capacity, ranking the country third globally in solar energy production last year.

Lantos acknowledged the challenges posed by the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy, emphasizing the need for effective energy storage solutions.

Additionally, Hungary is expanding its battery storage capabilities, and continues to invest in nuclear energy. The Paks I and future Paks II facilities play a crucial role in the nation's energy mix.

The minister also highlighted the potential of geothermal energy and biomass as part of Hungary's strategy to achieve energy independence.

""Good morning!"" yells out President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, walking across the stage up to the lectern. The audience -- all journalists, on paper at least -- yells a few good mornings back and stays seated for the Mexican head of state. It's not like the White House press room on the rare times the president ventures out. Things are tamer here. It's 7:17 a.m. Coffee isn't provided.

This is the mañanera: a talk and variety program formally called a presidential press conference that runs over two or three hours and sets the daily tone for political life in America's southern neighbor.

It's a big reason why Mexico's president is arguably the world's most successful politician -- if one were to judge by his high approval ratings in the 60s and up and unchallenged dominance weeks before his constitutionally mandated single term winds down after elections on June 2.

López Obrador shares many traits with other populist leaders. He's a nationalist and a bruiser in the mold of India's Narendra Modi, Hungary's Viktor Orban or Donald Trump -- here some call the GOP standard-bearer ""America's AMLO."" He attacks the media, nurses grievances that are deeply local yet feel familiar to an outsider, picks at institutional foundations like independent courts, and constantly pits ""the people"" against the ""corrupt"" establishment. He's pragmatic on policy, like them too, and plays up his ""wins,"" sometimes facts be damned. Unlike them, López Obrador is a ""man of the left,"" which brings home that style and performance on stage -- rather than ideological consistency or actual job performance -- are the keys to success in our age of politics as spectacle.

He hasn't gotten as much attention outside his country as his predecessors or other major leaders do, and doesn't seek it. But in important ways, the Mexican president's approach is revealing of what works in 21st century politics.

Yes, he is a familiar Latin America type. A line goes from Fidel Castro to Hugo Chávez to him: TV cameras liked them all, and they claimed to have a genuine connection with the forgotten men and women of their country -- in López Obrador's case, with the legitimacy of a landslide election win and massive support. That qualifier is important. American politics resemble Mexico's not because we're both becoming banana republics, but because López Obrador is good at what matters now, as is Donald Trump. He has personalized the highly institutionalized office of the president and broken the hold of long-established parties. That isn't a right or left thing either. Emmanuel Macron, no member of the Populist International, pulled off a similar feat when he broke up France's party system to romp to the French presidency before the age of 40.

Also strikingly, López Obrador has brought the public with him. Even as he has loud detractors, Mexico isn't ""polarized"" the way the U.S. and major European democracies are. He has done that by filling the public space -- and crowding others out -- with a mix of bombast, charm and an ability to connect with voters directly. Trump lost his last election because he overdid the first and lacked the second, but he's also leading polls because at least he's driving the conversation. Joe Biden's problem is that while his legislative record may be impressive, as a figure he's small on our screens and therefore in our minds. Who was the last president to fill as little space in American public life -- maybe George H.W. Bush?

At the mañanera last Thursday, 16 days before AMLO's handpicked successor Claudia Sheinbaum will almost certainly win the election, the president wants to talk about electricity. Mexico had power outages the previous week. Seven men in suits who run the various bodies of government that oversee the power grid follow him onto the stage.

Sound boring? Wait.

They are here, López Obrador says, ""to inform, inform, inform."" The television screen next to him lights up with a picture of a front page of the newspaper Reforma (""a filthy pamphlet of conservatism,"" AMLO narrates) then a montage of prominent journalists talking about the blackouts -- with ominous music as a soundtrack. The unsubtle point: The media is, in his words, ""at the service"" of oligarchical powers, and it exaggerates and lies. ""That is their job,"" he says, ""alarmism and opposing everything our government does.""

López Obrador notes that television anchors make ""five times more"" than him. AMLO talks about money all the time, like Trump. He's ostentatious about his austere life -- AMLO's famous for wearing scuffed shoes -- the same way that Trump is ostentatious about being wealthy. Both connect with people that way.

The press can't help itself, López Obrador says almost with pity, they aren't ""technical experts."" The seven electricity officials are called up to the podium and speak one after the other for an hour. Charts and maps pop up. The government is handling this well, they all say.

When the president comes back up, he replays the top of that press-bashing video and quotes Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels about having to repeat a lie to make it true. ""They think that that way they will manipulate [the people],"" he says. ""They"" is the media, rich people (""fifis,"" he calls them), the political establishment, Americans of course. They stole his first ""victory"" in 2006, when AMLO lost the election to Felipe Calderón, in a vote that he has never acknowledged as legitimate. A former mayor of Mexico City and self-declared outsider, though he began in politics decades ago with the then ruling party, he lost again in 2012 before winning a landslide in 2018. López Obrador enjoys nursing his grievances over an allegedly unfair election -- a ""political lynching,"" he calls it. ""No president has been attacked as much as I have."" There's a guy north of the border who'd disagree and at the same time admire the method; people close to them say they get along. (""Trump is a tough guy,"" says AMLO's former foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard. ""He built good relations with President López Obrador, who is also a tough guy."")

The journalists are props in this live broadcast. A couple are called on. The first is Sandra Aguilar, a pleasant lady who, I later learn, runs a one-person media website. She asks two questions that couldn't be softer. I raise my hand repeatedly, as do others; AMLO doesn't call on anyone else. We get a jab at a U.S. military commander who claimed that ""70 percent of Mexico"" is controlled by the narcos. AMLO says he set him straight. Violence in a southern state comes up and AMLO calls up several ready charts of crime statistics, all favorable to his administration. He takes a dig at the highest court whose judges he wants to rotate out -- one of the reasons why opponents consider him a threat to Mexican democracy. He touts Mexico's low national debt and unemployment. There's more media commentary. The New York Times gets dinged twice. And so on, until he wraps up around 10.

""I offer my apologies,"" he says toward the end, ""because I repeat myself a lot. But it's my job.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.1450980392156862,454331615,4,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,eng-9588640

Diverse and complementary purposes are at hand to facilitate the green transition, the representatives of main developers and operators in Southeast Europe said at Belgrade Energy Forum.

The European Union is determined to accelerate the development of energy storage markets with ample subsidies. Enormous underground water heaters and capacitors at major transmission substations all qualify as batteries.

They are becoming essential for balancing electricity demand and supply, because the wind and sun are largely unpredictable, so-called intermittent energy sources, dependent on the weather. Investors and other panelists with various backgrounds and expertise agreed at a panel on batteries at Belgrade Energy Forum that there is progress in terms of legislation, costs and financing. However, they require banks to participate more in the endeavor.

Senior Associate Panos Kefalas of Aurora Energy Research moderated the discussion. In his view, supported by the other participants, stability and predictability are crucial for the installation of both merchant and subsidized assets. The authorities need to help investors become more confident in revenue streams, to provide a business case, the analyst pointed out.

He highlighted the role of long-term contracts or, for the balancing market, more accurate risk assessment. One year ago, financing batteries was still a no go but now many banks are eager to tap into the opportunity, Kefalas said.

""Current power systems can only handle a specific amount of renewables before they need significant changes in the way they operate, both technically and in terms of power market design. And energy storage is going to be one of the pillars for realizing all these decarbonization agendas,"" he stated. The energy storage sector is only starting in the Western Balkans, and with decarbonization on the agenda, the kinds of challenges that more mature market are facing are about to emerge, he explained.

Director of Janom Energy and Battery Matej Šanta categorizes the firm as a mid-sized private equity investor. He urged for a stable and predictable legislation and grid access.

Besides the required energy laws, bylaws have to give clear guidelines to regulators to adopt new technologies, Šanta said. Batteries and other storage systems depend much on guidance for the permitting process including grid connection, he underscored. As for the emergence of storage markets, the representative of Slovakian firm janom Investments highlighted the role of transparent pricing signals, which companies need to calculate project returns.

Companies need transparent pricing signals to calculate project returns

Janom prefers clear and predictable legislation over subsidies, as it allows it to assess its risks in entering a market, according to Šanta. Another major factor is the openness of electricity transmission and distribution system operators (TSOs and DSOs) and regulators, he added. Their task is to adopt grid codes to allow new technologies, for instance independent aggregation, and even some EU countries still lack them.

""As an investor, we are bringing our experience from other markets, namely in Central Europe and, partially, the Nordics. We need local partners to adapt this experience to local conditions,"" Šanta stated.

President and Chief Executive Officer of Faria Renewables Thalia Valkouma said the focus should be on diversification of storage systems so that different technologies cover all uses. The other major points are expanding the lifespan of such systems and their environmental sustainability, in her words.

Capital expenditure for battery energy storage systems - BESS has been dropping quickly, said Valkouma, whose company is investing and developing projects in Greece and other countries. Faria Renewables was one of the winners at the second battery auction in Greece. It has a strategic target of more than 5 GW.

""We believe that storage is one of the next big things in the energy sector,"" she stressed. Valkouma said grid and storage expansion doesn't match investments in solar and wind power. It leads to ever-increasing curtailments, particularly in Greece, as well as zero and negative prices, which raises investment risk. If renewable energy investments drop, it will create a vicious circle, she warned.

Rimac Energy is oriented toward designing, developing and manufacturing its battery systems in Southeast Europe including software development, data management and localized support, Director Wasim Sarwar Dilov said at the panel. It helps localize control, he underscored, pointing to the rising risks of grid collapse.

Domestic design and manufacturing not only supports the economy, but then BESS is optimized for the local market's needs, Sarwar Dilov asserted.

Rimac Energy's SineStack is a modular and scalable system with a 40% improvement in floor space

Rimac Energy, based in Croatia, has been designing the most technologically advanced battery energy storage system in the world, he claimed. ""Our system is a fully integrated battery energy storage and power delivery solution. We've developed a unique inverter architecture and fully incorporated the power electronics and the thermal management systems and all the power distribution,"" Sarwar Dilov added.

The SineStack, a modular and scalable system with ""a fantastic round trip efficiency,"" takes up very little space, he stressed. The improvement in floor space against other available solutions is 40%, plus there are no additional inverters, according to the company presentation.

Each building block has 830 kWh in capacity and the facility can grow to 150 MWh and more, Sarwar Dilov said. Its lifetime is 20 years with multiple cycles every day, he underscored.

NGEN Group, headquartered in Slovenia, has a total pipeline of more than 1.6 GWh around Europe. Working with Tesla, it has been operating BESS facilities for four years.

The company is developing software for battery storage. Co-founder and CEO Roman Bernard placed emphasis on cybersecurity of any device in the electricity system. ""If we lose frequency in the grid, everybody will suffer,"" he stressed.

In the BESS segment, grid services are technically much more challenging than storing energy from photovoltaic systems, Bernard said. Their top level is the balancing market for transmission system operators, followed by arbitrage, and next is energy supply as another product, he explained.

The EU has made it clear that it would push for the creation of a balancing market, for which BESS operators need motivation, the head of NGEN Group said.

The bottom line is that 5 GW of solar power at noon needs 5 GW of consumption and storage ""to take it out of the grid,"" Roman Bernard added.

Electricity producers recently lost an estimated EUR 1.8 million in one day in Hungary as prices at the power exchange were below zero for nine consecutive hours, said the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Principal for Energy Efficiency Bojan Bogdanović. In his view, the sector needs diversification of balancing and energy storage.

Batteries are one part of the solution and irreplaceable for some applications, while seasonal thermal energy storage and coupling electricity with other sectors can contribute significantly, Bogdanović said. The technology is very affordable, he added.

The energy sector requires diversification of balancing and energy storage, says Bojan Bogdanović from the EBRD

Water in underground pits is heated using excess renewable electricity to be used for district heating in the winter season. As gas stocks in Europe are usually the lowest in January and February and the fuel is the most expensive then, such seasonal storage can replace it in heating, shaving off the price peaks. It also leaves more gas available for combined heat and power plants, Bogdanović asserted.

Turning back to the negative prices phenomenon, he concluded that it makes several other energy storage technologies bankable.

The results of a simulation at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia showed that a 5.3 GW battery with a capacity of 1.77 TWh or two full weeks would be needed to balance the country's annual electricity consumption if it was covered by photovoltaics alone.

The capacity item is equivalent to 16.1% of the 11.01 TWh measured in 2023. The required installed PV power came in at 8.63 GW, said Professor Miloš Pantoš from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. He is also a member of the Supervisory Board of GEN energija. Notably, Slovenia now hosts 1.1 GW in solar power capacity.

The excersise revealed that, in financial and technical terms, batteries aren't appropriate, but the technology is developing fast, according to Pantoš.

""The new paradigm is that consumers will have to adapt to the sources to keep the system in balance,"" he stated. But while consumer response is already emerging with flexibility markets, Pantoš suggested that solutions are necessary on the production side as well. Within a few years, Slovenia may roll out legislation for a capacity firming mechanism, obligating all electricity generation facilities to include a storage system for stability and reliability, he estimated.",balkangreenenergynews.com,news,Balkan Green Energy News,Igor Todorović,0.4274509803921569,454317063,26,https://balkangreenenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Belgrade-Energy-Forum-energy-storage-is-next-big-thing.jpg,

But in office she has proved to be a model citizen of the European, G7 and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Meloni hasn't emulated the EU delinquent Viktor Orbán, Hungary's prime minister, as many expected. She has fully supported Brussels and NATO in backing Ukraine against Russia and has bolstered Italy's alliance with the United States.

She also seems to share some of the EU's views on immigration - though her critics would probably say that's more because she has brought Brussels into her orbit than vice versa.

Last July, Meloni, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte signed a memorandum of understanding with Tunisian President Kais Saied. The EU agreed to direct budgetary support and accelerated EU funding related to macroeconomic stability, economy and trade, renewable energies, and people-to-people contacts.

In exchange, Tunisia agreed to cooperate with the EU on migration control. In particular, it would prevent migrant departures by sea, address migrant smuggling and trafficking, and assist in returning foreigners seeking to reach Europe from Tunisia, to their home countries. In turn, the EU promised to enhance Tunisian citizens' mobility to its member states.

The agreement was controversial in the EU, with some member states saying they weren't properly consulted before it was reached. Their concern included Von der Leyen doing a deal with Saied, who has been dragging Tunisia down the slippery slope of autocracy.

Meloni has focused much attention on Tunisia - visiting it for the fourth time last month - apparently for two main reasons.

One is to establish Italy as a hub of African energy. The other is that Tunisia is a major launchpad to Europe for irregular migrants, and Italy is a leading destination. Although in 2024, Libya has been the main departure point and Spain the main point of arrival, many irregular immigrants make landfall in Italy. Lucio Malan, the Italian Senate's chief whip, recently said, 'Sicily is closer to Tunisia than Sicily is to Rome.'

Controlling migration is probably one of the main drivers of Meloni's Africa policy. Among her other surprises was the first Italy-Africa summit in Rome in January, under the theme 'A Bridge for Common Growth'. It attracted 20 African government leaders and representatives from 46 countries - including Saied. Also in attendance were leaders of the African Union (AU), African Development Bank, EU and International Monetary Fund.

The summit inaugurated the year of Italy's G7 presidency and allowed Meloni to punt her so-called Mattei Plan for Africa, ostensibly based on the 'cooperation as equals' principle. It has six pillars - education, health, energy, water, agriculture and infrastructure.

In her speech to the summit, Meloni underscored energy, saying Italy's goal was 'to help African nations that are interested in producing enough energy to meet their own needs and then exporting the excess to Europe, combining two needs: Africa's need to develop this production and generate wealth, and Europe's need to ensure new energy supply routes.'

She said Italy had been working for some time with the EU on building the connection infrastructure for this energy bridge, citing for example the ELMED electricity interconnection between Italy and Tunisia, and the new SoutH2 Corridor to transport hydrogen from North Africa to central Europe, passing through Italy.

Meloni said Mattei Plan aimed to unleash Africa's potential and guarantee Africa's youth 'the right not to be forced to emigrate, and not to have to cut your roots in search of a better life, which is increasingly difficult to achieve in Europe.'

The EU representatives generally welcomed Italy's plan. Von der Leyen praised it as consistent with the European Global Gateway initiative, which includes a Europe-Africa investment package of €150 billion. As has been observed, it will be essential to integrate the Mattei Plan into an EU frame, as the €5.5 billion announced by Meloni isn't enough to develop a continent-wide strategy.

In his response, AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat lamented Italy's lack of consultation with Africa before announcing the Mattei Plan. Yet he apparently agreed with her in principle that the only effective strategy for managing migratory flows was 'transforming the vast regions of poverty, exclusion and human suffering into a space of prosperity and development.'

There have been other criticisms. A group of mainly environmental African non-governmental organisations rebuked Italy for not consulting civil society and for focusing the plan on fossil fuels. Other critics expressed concern about the EU jeopardising its values by collaborating with the likes of Saied, and for essentially buying the support of African countries to keep migrants at bay.

Some are suspicious of Von der Leyen's support for the Mattei Plan, noting she faces a difficult re-election next month, against growing support for EU anti-immigrant right-wing parties.

Meloni did win a rather unexpected endorsement from African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina, who met her the day after the summit. He declared that the African Development Bank was ready to work with the Italian government because 'the Mattei Plan fits into the priorities of the Bank ... You can count on the African Development Bank as your partner of choice.'

Adesina's approval suggested to Italy's Istituto Affari Internazionali that despite its many faults, Meloni's plan could be salvaged by wider consultation within Africa, not just with elites, and integrating it into a broader European framework.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,,0.3254901960784313,454292797,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ernew.png,

ZALAEGERSZEG, Hungary, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Cutting-edge sustainable energy products from China were on display at the Greentech conference in Zalaegerszeg, Hungary this week, drawing the attention of industry leaders and government officials.

Tang Rui, founder and CEO of Shanghai Cantron Robotics, stressed the groundbreaking innovations his company has introduced to the European market.

""What we want to enable is autonomous driving plus combined energy storage to build a mobile energy solution for society,"" Tang told Xinhua in an interview during the conference.

His company's latest product is a Level 4 autonomous driving energy robot equipped with a 104 kWh battery. The robot can be summoned via the Drop'nGo mobile app, offering a convenient charging service that eliminates the need for fixed charging stations.

""Our robot does more than just charging EVs: it can also charge back to the microgrid to help with electricity usage,"" Tang said.

This innovative approach addresses the challenges of infrastructure investment, making it a more cost-effective and efficient solution for accelerating electrification.

Tang is optimistic about the future of his company in Europe. ""The European market is very important for us. Hungary, in particular, is a crucial portal due to its significant battery manufacturing capacity,"" he said.

He emphasized that his company is working with partners in Hungary and other European countries, such as HUMDA, WHB Energy, and IonDynamics Energy.

Meanwhile, chief organizer of the GreenTech conference Karoly Kovacs emphasized the growing importance of Chinese companies at the event, as well as on the broader Hungarian market.

""We have several Chinese exhibitors this year, including major players like Cantron Robotics and BYD. They have brought fascinating innovations such as autonomous electric car charging robots,"" Kovacs told Xinhua.

These robots are not only autonomous but also fully programmable, capable of navigating cities to find and charge electric vehicles before returning to their base.

Kovacs praised the high quality and innovation of Chinese companies' offerings.

""Chinese companies are now at the forefront of innovation across many fields. Their presence in Hungary is increasingly significant, both at the governmental level and among the general public,"" he said.

The Chinese exhibits at GreenTech were interactive, including hands-on demonstrations and presentations.

Kovacs predicted an even stronger presence of Chinese companies at GreenTech events in the future. ""This year, companies like NIO and BYD approached us to participate, showing their keen interest in our conference,"" he said.

Energy Minister Lantos Csaba highlighted Hungary's commitment to enhancing energy security and sovereignty, as it prepares to assume the presidency of the European Union Council in July. ""Our main task will be to restore Europe's competitiveness, particularly in securing energy supply,"" said the minister.

He highlighted Hungary's significant achievements in renewable energy, including over 6.3 GW of solar capacity, ranking the country third globally in solar energy production last year.

Lantos acknowledged the challenges posed by the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy, emphasizing the need for effective energy storage solutions.

Additionally, Hungary is expanding its battery storage capabilities, and continues to invest in nuclear energy. The Paks I and future Paks II facilities play a crucial role in the nation's energy mix.

The minister also highlighted the potential of geothermal energy and biomass as part of Hungary's strategy to achieve energy independence.

The GreenTech conference featured 80 exhibitors and 20 industry presentations focusing on topics such as artificial intelligence (AI), the circular economy, and green transportation. ■

It added, however, that Moscow is now intensifying its assault on other parts of the front.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault in the northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, visited the region's capital on Friday to discuss the battle for Vovchansk, a town that sits fewer than three miles from the Russian border.

The army said on Friday: ""The Ukrainian defence forces have stopped Russian troops in the Kharkiv sector.

""The situation is under control, counter-offensive actions are under way.""

Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine's commander-in-chief, said on social media that, despite Russia's initial success, ""the enemy has got completely bogged down in street battles for Vovchansk and suffered very high losses in assault units.""

In an attempt to seize the town, Russia ""is currently moving reserves from different sectors to support active assault operations, but to no avail"", Syrsky added.

He warned, however, that the situation was turbulent on the eastern front, where Moscow says its forces have made a string of gains in the past two weeks.

Fighting near the eastern towns of Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove has been particularly ""intense"", he said.

Russia said on Thursday it had made inroads near the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk.

Just three days earlier it claimed to have seized the village of Bilohorivka, a key target for Moscow, which is seeking to wrest control of the entire Lugansk region from Kyiv.

Moscow said it launched the offensive in Ukraine's northeast to create a ""buffer zone"" along the border to prevent future Ukrainian attacks on its territory.

As Ukraine rushed troops to the northeast, Kyiv again accused Moscow of deliberately targeting civilians in strikes.

Ukrainian Railways, the state-owned train operator, reported a flurry of attacks on Kharkiv's railway system overnight that damaged tracks, train carriages and buildings.

""The enemy continues to make deliberate attempts to stop the railway in the Kharkiv region,"" it said on Telegram.

The company shared photos showing smoke rising from a wrecked carriage, twisted metal and debris beside tracks and a depot with some blown-out windows.

It said long-distance and suburban trains were running as scheduled despite repeated Russian strikes on the network, which is vital for both civilians and the military.

Strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, killed at least seven people on Thursday, local authorities said.

More than 11,000 people in the wider region have been evacuated since Russia began its new offensive two weeks ago, according to Oleg Synegubov, a local governor.

Separately, Ukraine fired missiles overnight at the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed head of the region, said the strikes killed two ""chance passers-by"".

Thank you for following today's live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The day's key developments were:

Russia and Belarus will tighten their cooperation in industry and technology in the face of Western sanctions against both their economies, presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday.

We reported earlier that Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally (see post at 12:06 pm).

Russian forces have become ""bogged down"" in attempts to seize the border-town Vovchansk, but have sharpened their offensive elsewhere along the eastern front, Ukraine's top general said on Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Despite initial success , ""the enemy has got completely bogged down in street battles for Vovchansk and suffered very high losses in assault units', said Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky on social media.

In an attempt to seize the town, Russia ""is currently moving reserves from different sectors to support active assault operations, but to no avail"", Mr Syrsky added.

Although he warned that the situation on the eastern front was unstable, where Russia claims its forces have made a series of gains in the past two weeks.

Fighting near the eastern towns of Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove has been particularly ""intense"", he added.

The fresh offensive on the region has seen more than 11,000 people evacuate.

World Bank President Ajay Banga said on Friday that he is ""absolutely"" open to the idea of managing a fund for Ukraine that would pay out a G7 loan to the war-ravaged country.

The sum would be based on the earnings from frozen Russian assets, at least for non-military purposes, Mr Banga said.

""All I know is that if they do decide to give it to us, would I be ready? Yeah,"" Mr Banga said at a meeting of G7 finance ministers called to tackle the concept of such a loan.

He added: ""I could manage a fund of that type. I would need safeguards, I would need to make sure our people understand how to use it.""

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, held a meeting on the regional situation in Kharkiv on Friday.

""We paid special attention to the housing needs of our people who had been displaced from Kharkiv region territories targeted by enemy shelling,"" he wrote on X.

Ukraine has freed at least 50 convicts under a new law that allows them to serve in exchange for the possibility of parole, as part of a wider effort to replenish Ukraine's depleted forces.

It is unclear how many prisoners in total have been released since the law was enacted a week ago.

Denys Maliuska, Ukraine's justice minister, said that 10,000 to 20,000 prisoners could be recruited.

We reported earlier that the number of convicts in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, as prisoners are promised a pardon if they survive six months fighting on the front lines (see post at 9:55 am).

Russia has detained two more senior military figures - the deputy head of the army's General Staff and a senior procurement official at the defence ministry - as a bribery scandal intensifies, investigators said on Thursday.

The arrests of Lieutenant-General Vadim Shamarin and ministry official Vladimir Verteletsky bumped the number of arrested military officials to five in a single month.

The crackdown signals a major effort to crack down on corruption surrounding the awarding of lucrative military contracts at a time when Russian forces are fighting in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Spain on Sunday and will meet with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe on Monday, said sources familiar with his movements.

It comes after Zelensky was forced to suspend all international visits last week amid tense fighting in the Kharkiv region.

Ukrainian forces have ""stopped"" Russia from advancing further into the northeastern Kharkiv region and are now counter-attacking, but Moscow is intensifying its assault on other parts of the front, Ukraine's army said Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Vladimir Putin is ready to halt the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that recognises the current battlefield lines, Russian sources have said.

The Russian leader had expressed frustration to a small group of advisers about Western attempts to stymie negotiations, three of the sources, who are familiar with discussions in Putin's inner circle, told Reuters.

They added that he was also vexed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's decision to rule out further truce talks.

""Putin can fight for as long as it takes, but Putin is also ready for a ceasefire - to freeze the war,"" said one of the sources, a senior Russian figure who has worked with the Kremlin chief.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian President had repeatedly made clear Russia was open to ceasefire discussions, saying the country did not want ""eternal war.""

Ukraine is seeking to maximise possible imports of electricity from European Union countries to compensate for the generation capacity destroyed by the Russian attacks, Ukrainian energy minister said on Friday.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have caused significant damage and blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have cost more than $1 billion (£786 million) of damage to the sector and drained of 8,000 MWh of generating capacity from the energy system, the government said.

Currently, Ukraine can import from the EU states no more than 1,700 Mwh of electricity simultaneously.

""We're negotiating. Our task is to maximise this figure,"" Energy Minister German Galushchenko told parliament.

We reported earlier that Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Now, we are hearing that on Friday Russia arrested more than 20 people in connection with the attack.

Mr Bortnikov repeated Russia's assertion, for which it has not provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack that killed more than 140 people in March.

Ukraine has dismissed the allegation as ""absurd"".

Vladimir Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally Alexander Lukashenko.

Belarus started taking delivery of such Russian warheads - shorter-range less powerful nuclear weapons that could potentially be used on the battlefield - in June last year.

It marked the first movement of such warheads since the fall of the Soviet Union, some of which are three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Vladimir Putin's call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, broadcast through Kremlin briefings to Reuters, should be treated with caution.

Its real aim may be to fragment European support for Ukraine ahead of a peace conference next month in Switzerland.

Ukraine's defence against Russia has lasted for more than two years and interest and patience is wearing thin in some European countries.

Putin is a master at spotting weakness and exploiting it. If he can sow more doubt into the minds of European leaders and populations, Putin knows that he will weaken Ukraine.

The Russian leader has regularly tried to pose as a peacenik since he launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, accusing Volodymyr Zelensky and Nato of forcing war on him.

But he also knows that the conditions he lays out for peace negotiations are unacceptable to the US, Ukraine's main backer, and will be ignored.

Underpinning Putin's offers of peace talks are tactics designed to fragment European support for Kyiv.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has visited the northeast region of Kharkiv amid Russia's renewed offensive in the region.

""The entire city and region of Kharkiv deserve our support, gratitude, and respect, as does every Ukrainian community and person who refuses to give in to the enemy,"" he wrote on X.

Sergey Viktorovich, the Russian foreign minister, has accused Ukraine of already using weapons supplied by the US to attack targets beyond its territory, in what he called ""the conflict zone and against civilian infrastructure"".

Russia has repeatedly said that Western arms shipment will only prolong the conflict and will not change the situation at the battlefield.

The Biden administration insists that US-supplied weapons should not be used beyond Ukrainian territories.

Romanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against a Romanian citizen accused of treason and spying for Russia for more than two years, they said on Friday.

The country's anti-organised crime prosecuting unit, DIICOT, said in a statement the suspect ""collected military information and took photographs of military equipment and staff movements in the border area with Ukraine which he then sent to diplomats from the Russian embassy in Bucharest"".

The alleged surveillance occurred near Tulcea, the southeastern Romanian county - near the country's border with Ukraine - beginning in 2022.

A Romanian court has approved the suspect's arrest for 30 days pending the criminal investigation

The US has interrogated claims by Britain's defence secretary that China was providing Russia with ""lethal aid"" for its war in Ukraine.

Grant Shapps on Wednesday said he had ""evidence"" of China providing or preparing to provide Russia with ""lethal aid"" for the Kremlin to use in its war against Ukraine.

But US national security adviser Jake Sullivan refuted the allegation, saying Washington had not observed that China had directly provided weapons to Russia.

""We have not seen that to date. I look forward to speaking with the UK to make sure that we have a common operating picture,"" Sullivan said.

Beijing on Thursday condemned what it called ""baseless and irresponsible statements made by British politicians"".

Ukraine used Atacms missiles to destroy a space radar in a strike on Crime, sources on the occupied peninsula said.

The Crimean Wind channel said the large Soviet military antenna was struck near the city of Alushta on the eastern coast.

At least six US-supplied Atacms hit the facility, where ""high-ranking military personnel... were located at the moment"", the Telegram channel wrote.

Russia's defence ministry claimed that the missile attack was repelled with its air defence forces shooting down at least three Atacms.

""Explosions were heard in almost all regions of Crimea. Russian air defences were active in many, but they were not very effective,"" Crimean Wind said.

Atesh, a pro-Ukrainian partisan group, claimed that there were many casualties, but said it was too early to confirm the damage to the radar centre.

The number of people locked up in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, Russian independent media reported on Friday.

The report said that some 105,000 prisoners were released between 2022-2023, citing data published in the official journal of Russia's prison service.

Russia started to recruit convicts to fight in Ukraine in 2022, when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the late head of the Wagner mercenary group, began to offer prisoners a pardon if they survived six months at the front.

Mr Prigozhin, who was killed in a plane crash last year, said he had recruited 50,000 prisoners for Wagner.

The first batch of Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots have graduated from F-16 training at an Arizona military base, an Air National Guard spokesman has said.

Capt. Eric Hannigan would not confirm how many have graduated or the exact date of graduation ""out of abundance of caution for their safety"".

The pilots are now headed to Europe for additional training, according to a person with knowledge of their movements.

Ukraine is set to receive more than 60 F-16s from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.

A Ukrainian missile attack has killed two people near Crimea's Simferopol, the head of the Russian-annexed territory has said

Sergei Aksyonov said the missile hit an empty building near Alushta on the peninsula's Black Sea coast.

It came as Russia's defence ministry claimed that their air defences had intercepted three US-donated long-range Atacms missiles over Crimea, reported TASS news agency. Three Ukrainian sea drones firing towards the peninsula were also struck by Moscow's forces, the ministry further claimed.

Ukraine has not issued an official statement.

Unofficial Ukrainian military bloggers reported a number of targets had been hit throughout the peninsula.

Russian bloggers on the peninsula wrote that not all incoming missiles had been intercepted.

We reported earlier than Russia has now seized more than half of the border town Vovchansk amid its renewed ground offensive (see post at 8:29 am).

Read the Telegraph's full frontline dispatch here.

The US should lift its ""absolutely unfair"" ban on the Ukrainian army using American-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia, Ukraine's top national security official has said.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko said that lifting the restriction ""would be beneficial"" for Ukraine and could help to thwart Moscow's renewed offensive.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has said that any strikes in Russian territory would be strictly for ""defence"".

Washington has argued the ban was necessary to avoid further escalation with Moscow.

The United States is expected to announce an additional $275 million (£234 million) in military aid for Ukraine on Friday as Kyiv struggles to hold off Russian advances in the Kharkiv region, said two US officials.

This will be the fourth instalment of military aid for Ukraine after US Congress last month passed a $61 billion (£48 billion) major military aid package, following a six month delay during which Russia gained advantage on the battlefield.

It comes as the Biden administration promised to supply a regular flow of weapons and to ensure they reach the front lines as swiftly as possible.

Russian forces now control more than half the territory of border town Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, a Russian MP has said.

Viktor Vodolatskiy added that the towns of Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk would be Russia's next major targets once it takes over Vovchansk.

Fears that Russia would mount an attack on any Nato member are unfounded, the Hungarian prime minister has said.

Viktor Orban said on Friday that the war in Ukraine, now in its third year, highlights the limitations of Russia's military power.

""I do not consider it logical that Russia, which cannot even defeat Ukraine, would all of a sudden come and swallow the Western world whole,"" said Orban. ""The chances of this are extremely slim.""

Hungary, a member of the European Union and Nato, has refused to provide military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

We reported earlier that the head of Russia's Federal Security Service accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre in March and US officials said they had intelligence showing it was carried out by the network's Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan.

Russian spy chief, Alexander Bortnikov, has now accused Nato of enabling the transfer of militants from terror groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan to Ukraine to help push back against Russian forces.

The Kharkiv region is still recovering after being hit by multiple Russian attacks, said Ukraine's president.

Volodymyr Zelensky said that one of Ukraine's largest printing facilities was struck in the attack, killing and injuring a number of people.

""Book storage and equipment were destroyed by fire. Many Ukrainian publishers had their books printed there...Russia want to burn and destroy all aspects of life,"" Zelensky wrote on X.

Ukrainian military intelligence was instrumental in a fatal attack on a concert hall near Moscow, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service has said.

Alexander Bortnikov said an investigation was ongoing, but it was ""already safe to say that Ukrainian military intelligence is directly involved in this attack,"" he said.

The attack, which killed 144 people, was claimed by an offshoot of the Islamic State group.

Ukraine has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack.

As the joint initiative just turned two, the European Commission released country reports tracking progress.

Diversifying the EU's energy supplies, speeding up the green transition and improving the bloc's energy security are the goals of the REPowerEU plan which celebrated its two-year anniversary recently.

On Tuesday, EU ministers gave final approval to the electricity market reform - also geared towards improving the bloc's energy security. The reform further promotes the expansion of renewable energies and should better protect consumers from escalating electricity prices in the future.

Two years of REPowerEU

Faced with the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022. The plan foresees energy saving goals, the production of clean energy and the diversification of energy supplies - and ultimately ending the dependency on Russian fossil fuels.

Since the adoption of the REPowerEU plan, the EU has successfully reduced gas supplies from Russia. The share of gas from Russia - by pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) - made up 45 percent of all imported gas in 2021, but only 15 percent in 2023. The Union replaced it with gas from other third countries. Norway and the USA have become the largest gas suppliers.

Seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, refined petroleum products and Russian coal imports have been banned through EU sanctions.

Natural gas consumption: How much did member states reduce?

In 27 country reports released for the two-year anniversary of REPowerEU, the European Commission compiled member states' performances between August 2022 and January 2024. Each country report includes a country-specific analysis on a range of points, for example on the key energy figures, diversification of energy supplies, energy price developments or the natural gas demand reduction.

The EU countries had agreed on a voluntary 15 percent reduction target of natural gas consumption and almost all countries have managed to lower their gas consumption. On EU level, the countries achieved a decrease of 18 percent.

21 countries lowered their gas consumption even further than the agreed-upon reduction target, including Denmark (-40%), Finland (-39%), Latvia (-30%), Sweden (-29%), Lithuania (-29%), Estonia (-28%), the Netherlands (-27%), Luxembourg (-26%), Portugal (-23%), Slovakia (-22%), France (-20%), Romania (-19%), Austria (-19%), Hungary (-18%) and Bulgaria (-18%), Italy (-17%), Croatia (-17%), Czechia (-17%), Greece (-16%), Germany (-16%) and Belgium (-16%).

According to the European Commission's data, only five countries did not meet the 15 percent reduction target. Among those are Spain (-12%), Slovenia (-10%), Poland (-8%), Ireland (-4%) and Malta, the only country which increased its gas consumption by ten percent. According to the report, Cyprus does not use natural gas.

Slovenia: Cutting down on consumption, but still reliant on Russian gas

In the case of Slovenia, the REPowerEU report pointed out that while the country 'has taken measures to strengthen alternative supplies of natural gas', it 'effectively remains reliant on Russian gas imported through Austria'.

Data by the Slovenian Energy Agency shows that in 2023 Slovenia imported 68.3 percent of gas from Austria and 28.3 percent from Algeria, through Italy. The agency cannot say with certainty how much of the gas imported from Austria is of Russian origin.

Even though gas importers have not had direct contracts for supply of gas from Russia for 2023 or 2024, the Energy Agency believes that the share of Russian gas was still predominant both in 2023 and in the first part of 2024.

Moving forward on renewables with room for improvement

The EU and its member states are continuously working towards becoming more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels. What have countries achieved so far?

In 2023, according to the European Commission, Portugal for example installed around 1.3 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity, bringing the total to 18.4 gigawatts - in comparison to 5.1 gigawatts in 2021. Additionally, the annual growth rate of installed renewable energy capacity increased to 7.6 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2021. However, the country's energy mix still included 69 percent fossil fuels in 2022.

Neighbouring Spain accelerated its transition towards a decarbonised energy system. According to Spanish grid operator Red Electrica, renewables accounted for 65.2 percent of the Spanish electricity mix in March - an all-time high. Still, the REPowerEU Spain report states that fossil fuels continue to play a central role in the country's energy system, representing 70.1 percent of primary energy imported in 2021.

Croatia quickly deduced its dependence on Russian gas imports by increasing its own production and intensifying the use of the existing LNG terminal. However, Croatia is still highly dependent on energy imports from countries outside the EU. Fossil fuels also continue to play an important role in Croatia's energy mix, as they accounted for 72 percent of gross available energy in 2022.

Moving into a greener direction, the country could soon start to produce green hydrogen: INA, the leading Croatian oil and gas company, recently signed two contracts related to renewable energy projects - one for the production of green hydrogen and the other for a bio-methane production facility. The completion of the construction of both plants is expected in 2026. The green hydrogen project, together with its solar plant and logistic capacity, will be co-financed via the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

The EU's RRF is a tool providing grants and loans to support reforms and investments in member states. It should, among other things, help member states become more sustainable, boost progress with the green and digital transition and achieve the EU target of climate neutrality by 2050.

...just hang on for a year

In Bulgaria, one of the major national energy reforms has been postponed by a year, which means the artificial maintenance of coal capacity will remain for at least another twelve months. This, in turn, could lead to the country not receiving the expected 1.3 billion BNG (around 665.15 million Euro) under the Bulgarian National Recovery and Resilience Plan which is funded under the EU's RFF. The energy reform is a mandatory requirement.

While Bulgarian MPs justified this citing a lack of readiness to switch from a regulated to a free electricity market or funds, several media outlets and experts attributed the decision mostly to pre-election populism.

A reformed energy market for security and a green future

This week, the electricity market reform took its final hurdle after representatives from EU member states and the European Parliament had signed off on the market reforms last December.

Belgium's Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten described the day as a 'milestone for the EU' on the path to a carbon-free and greener future. 'By adopting the electricity market reform, we are empowering consumers, ensuring security of supply and paving the way for a more stable, predictable and sustainable energy market.'

New long-term contracts between governments and electricity producers, under which the state would chip in if the market price drops below an agreed price, are central to the reform efforts.This is meant to incentivise domestic green and nuclear power production by ensuring a return on investments.

It also protects consumers who, in the future, have the right to both fixed-price contracts and contracts with dynamic prices. This would allow consumers to opt for both secure, long-term prices and contracts with changing prices if they want to take advantage of price fluctuations - for example, to use electricity when it is cheaper for charging electric cars or for heat pumps.

How does the electricity market work?

The electricity market in the EU works according to the merit-order principle, defining the order in which power plants connected to the electricity exchange are used to deliver energy and to determine the market price.

Those that can produce electricity at relatively low marginal cost, like wind farms, are used first to cover demand. But as demand rises beyond those initial sources' capabilities, higher marginal cost sources are used.

The final price therefore depends on which sources need to be used to meet demand, as well as fluctuations in the costs of using those sources. For example, a surge in natural gas prices raises the cost of using gas-fired power plants. (AGERPRES: RO - editors: Mariana Ionescu, Cristina Zaharia)

""The Ukrainian Defense Forces have stopped Russian troops in the Kharkiv sector and are conducting counter-offensive actions,"" the military said in a statement on social media.

Despite Russian forces being halted in Kharkiv, Moscow's troops were reinforcing its assault on other parts of the frontline.

The fresh Russian land assault has been raging across the northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Russian forces stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Thank you for following today's live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

We'll be back soon with more updates and analysis from the conflict.

Russia and Belarus will tighten their cooperation in industry and technology in the face of Western sanctions against both their economies, presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday.

We reported earlier that Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally (see post at 12:06 pm).

Russian forces have become ""bogged down"" in attempts to seize the border-town Vovchansk, but have sharpened their offensive elsewhere along the eastern front, Ukraine's top general said on Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Despite initial success , ""the enemy has got completely bogged down in street battles for Vovchansk and suffered very high losses in assault units', said Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky on social media.

In an attempt to seize the town, Russia ""is currently moving reserves from different sectors to support active assault operations, but to no avail"", Mr Syrsky added.

Although he warned that the situation on the eastern front was unstable, where Russia claims its forces have made a series of gains in the past two weeks.

Fighting near the eastern towns of Chasiv Yar, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove has been particularly ""intense"", he added.

The fresh offensive on the region has seen more than 11,000 people evacuate.

World Bank President Ajay Banga said on Friday that he is ""absolutely"" open to the idea of managing a fund for Ukraine that would pay out a G7 loan to the war-ravaged country.

The sum would be based on the earnings from frozen Russian assets, at least for non-military purposes, Mr Banga said.

""All I know is that if they do decide to give it to us, would I be ready? Yeah,"" Mr Banga said at a meeting of G7 finance ministers called to tackle the concept of such a loan.

He added: ""I could manage a fund of that type. I would need safeguards, I would need to make sure our people understand how to use it.""

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, held a meeting on the regional situation in Kharkiv on Friday.

""We paid special attention to the housing needs of our people who had been displaced from Kharkiv region territories targeted by enemy shelling,"" he wrote on X.

Ukraine has freed at least 50 convicts under a new law that allows them to serve in exchange for the possibility of parole, as part of a wider effort to replenish Ukraine's depleted forces.

It is unclear how many prisoners in total have been released since the law was enacted a week ago.

Denys Maliuska, Ukraine's justice minister, said that 10,000 to 20,000 prisoners could be recruited.

We reported earlier that the number of convicts in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, as prisoners are promised a pardon if they survive six months fighting on the front lines (see post at 9:55 am).

Russia has detained two more senior military figures - the deputy head of the army's General Staff and a senior procurement official at the defence ministry - as a bribery scandal intensifies, investigators said on Thursday.

The arrests of Lieutenant-General Vadim Shamarin and ministry official Vladimir Verteletsky bumped the number of arrested military officials to five in a single month.

The crackdown signals a major effort to crack down on corruption surrounding the awarding of lucrative military contracts at a time when Russian forces are fighting in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Spain on Sunday and will meet with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe on Monday, said sources familiar with his movements.

It comes after Zelensky was forced to suspend all international visits last week amid tense fighting in the Kharkiv region.

Ukrainian forces have ""stopped"" Russia from advancing further into the northeastern Kharkiv region and are now counter-attacking, but Moscow is intensifying its assault on other parts of the front, Ukraine's army said Friday.

Kyiv has been battling a fresh Russian land assault on its northeastern Kharkiv region since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.

Vladimir Putin is ready to halt the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that recognises the current battlefield lines, Russian sources have said.

The Russian leader had expressed frustration to a small group of advisers about Western attempts to stymie negotiations, three of the sources, who are familiar with discussions in Putin's inner circle, told Reuters.

They added that he was also vexed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's decision to rule out further truce talks.

""Putin can fight for as long as it takes, but Putin is also ready for a ceasefire - to freeze the war,"" said one of the sources, a senior Russian figure who has worked with the Kremlin chief.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian President had repeatedly made clear Russia was open to ceasefire discussions, saying the country did not want ""eternal war.""

Ukraine is seeking to maximise possible imports of electricity from European Union countries to compensate for the generation capacity destroyed by the Russian attacks, Ukrainian energy minister said on Friday.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have caused significant damage and blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have cost more than $1 billion (£786 million) of damage to the sector and drained of 8,000 MWh of generating capacity from the energy system, the government said.

Currently, Ukraine can import from the EU states no more than 1,700 Mwh of electricity simultaneously.

""We're negotiating. Our task is to maximise this figure,"" Energy Minister German Galushchenko told parliament.

We reported earlier that Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Now, we are hearing that on Friday Russia arrested more than 20 people in connection with the attack.

Mr Bortnikov repeated Russia's assertion, for which it has not provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack that killed more than 140 people in March.

Ukraine has dismissed the allegation as ""absurd"".

Vladimir Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally Alexander Lukashenko.

Belarus started taking delivery of such Russian warheads - shorter-range less powerful nuclear weapons that could potentially be used on the battlefield - in June last year.

It marked the first movement of such warheads since the fall of the Soviet Union, some of which are three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Vladimir Putin's call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, broadcast through Kremlin briefings to Reuters, should be treated with caution.

Its real aim may be to fragment European support for Ukraine ahead of a peace conference next month in Switzerland.

Ukraine's defence against Russia has lasted for more than two years and interest and patience is wearing thin in some European countries.

Putin is a master at spotting weakness and exploiting it. If he can sow more doubt into the minds of European leaders and populations, Putin knows that he will weaken Ukraine.

The Russian leader has regularly tried to pose as a peacenik since he launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, accusing Volodymyr Zelensky and Nato of forcing war on him.

But he also knows that the conditions he lays out for peace negotiations are unacceptable to the US, Ukraine's main backer, and will be ignored.

Underpinning Putin's offers of peace talks are tactics designed to fragment European support for Kyiv.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has visited the northeast region of Kharkiv amid Russia's renewed offensive in the region.

""The entire city and region of Kharkiv deserve our support, gratitude, and respect, as does every Ukrainian community and person who refuses to give in to the enemy,"" he wrote on X.

Sergey Viktorovich, the Russian foreign minister, has accused Ukraine of already using weapons supplied by the US to attack targets beyond its territory, in what he called ""the conflict zone and against civilian infrastructure"".

Russia has repeatedly said that Western arms shipment will only prolong the conflict and will not change the situation at the battlefield.

The Biden administration insists that US-supplied weapons should not be used beyond Ukrainian territories.

Romanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against a Romanian citizen accused of treason and spying for Russia for more than two years, they said on Friday.

The country's anti-organised crime prosecuting unit, DIICOT, said in a statement the suspect ""collected military information and took photographs of military equipment and staff movements in the border area with Ukraine which he then sent to diplomats from the Russian embassy in Bucharest"".

The alleged surveillance occurred near Tulcea, the southeastern Romanian county - near the country's border with Ukraine - beginning in 2022.

A Romanian court has approved the suspect's arrest for 30 days pending the criminal investigation

The US has interrogated claims by Britain's defence secretary that China was providing Russia with ""lethal aid"" for its war in Ukraine.

Grant Shapps on Wednesday said he had ""evidence"" of China providing or preparing to provide Russia with ""lethal aid"" for the Kremlin to use in its war against Ukraine.

But US national security adviser Jake Sullivan refuted the allegation, saying Washington had not observed that China had directly provided weapons to Russia.

""We have not seen that to date. I look forward to speaking with the UK to make sure that we have a common operating picture,"" Sullivan said.

Beijing on Thursday condemned what it called ""baseless and irresponsible statements made by British politicians"".

Ukraine used Atacms missiles to destroy a space radar in a strike on Crime, sources on the occupied peninsula said.

The Crimean Wind channel said the large Soviet military antenna was struck near the city of Alushta on the eastern coast.

At least six US-supplied Atacms hit the facility, where ""high-ranking military personnel... were located at the moment"", the Telegram channel wrote.

Russia's defence ministry claimed that the missile attack was repelled with its air defence forces shooting down at least three Atacms.

""Explosions were heard in almost all regions of Crimea. Russian air defences were active in many, but they were not very effective,"" Crimean Wind said.

Atesh, a pro-Ukrainian partisan group, claimed that there were many casualties, but said it was too early to confirm the damage to the radar centre.

The number of people locked up in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, Russian independent media reported on Friday.

The report said that some 105,000 prisoners were released between 2022-2023, citing data published in the official journal of Russia's prison service.

Russia started to recruit convicts to fight in Ukraine in 2022, when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the late head of the Wagner mercenary group, began to offer prisoners a pardon if they survived six months at the front.

Mr Prigozhin, who was killed in a plane crash last year, said he had recruited 50,000 prisoners for Wagner.

The first batch of Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots have graduated from F-16 training at an Arizona military base, an Air National Guard spokesman has said.

Capt. Eric Hannigan would not confirm how many have graduated or the exact date of graduation ""out of abundance of caution for their safety"".

The pilots are now headed to Europe for additional training, according to a person with knowledge of their movements.

Ukraine is set to receive more than 60 F-16s from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.

A Ukrainian missile attack has killed two people near Crimea's Simferopol, the head of the Russian-annexed territory has said

Sergei Aksyonov said the missile hit an empty building near Alushta on the peninsula's Black Sea coast.

It came as Russia's defence ministry claimed that their air defences had intercepted three US-donated long-range Atacms missiles over Crimea, reported TASS news agency. Three Ukrainian sea drones firing towards the peninsula were also struck by Moscow's forces, the ministry further claimed.

Ukraine has not issued an official statement.

Unofficial Ukrainian military bloggers reported a number of targets had been hit throughout the peninsula.

Russian bloggers on the peninsula wrote that not all incoming missiles had been intercepted.

We reported earlier than Russia has now seized more than half of the border town Vovchansk amid its renewed ground offensive (see post at 8:29 am).

Read the Telegraph's full frontline dispatch here.

The US should lift its ""absolutely unfair"" ban on the Ukrainian army using American-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia, Ukraine's top national security official has said.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko said that lifting the restriction ""would be beneficial"" for Ukraine and could help to thwart Moscow's renewed offensive.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has said that any strikes in Russian territory would be strictly for ""defence"".

Washington has argued the ban was necessary to avoid further escalation with Moscow.

The United States is expected to announce an additional $275 million (£234 million) in military aid for Ukraine on Friday as Kyiv struggles to hold off Russian advances in the Kharkiv region, said two US officials.

This will be the fourth instalment of military aid for Ukraine after US Congress last month passed a $61 billion (£48 billion) major military aid package, following a six month delay during which Russia gained advantage on the battlefield.

It comes as the Biden administration promised to supply a regular flow of weapons and to ensure they reach the front lines as swiftly as possible.

Russian forces now control more than half the territory of border town Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, a Russian MP has said.

Viktor Vodolatskiy added that the towns of Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk would be Russia's next major targets once it takes over Vovchansk.

Fears that Russia would mount an attack on any Nato member are unfounded, the Hungarian prime minister has said.

Viktor Orban said on Friday that the war in Ukraine, now in its third year, highlights the limitations of Russia's military power.

""I do not consider it logical that Russia, which cannot even defeat Ukraine, would all of a sudden come and swallow the Western world whole,"" said Orban. ""The chances of this are extremely slim.""

Hungary, a member of the European Union and Nato, has refused to provide military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

We reported earlier that the head of Russia's Federal Security Service accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre in March and US officials said they had intelligence showing it was carried out by the network's Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan.

Russian spy chief, Alexander Bortnikov, has now accused Nato of enabling the transfer of militants from terror groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan to Ukraine to help push back against Russian forces.

The Kharkiv region is still recovering after being hit by multiple Russian attacks, said Ukraine's president.

Volodymyr Zelensky said that one of Ukraine's largest printing facilities was struck in the attack, killing and injuring a number of people.

""Book storage and equipment were destroyed by fire. Many Ukrainian publishers had their books printed there...Russia want to burn and destroy all aspects of life,"" Zelensky wrote on X.

Ukrainian military intelligence was instrumental in a fatal attack on a concert hall near Moscow, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service has said.

Alexander Bortnikov said an investigation was ongoing, but it was ""already safe to say that Ukrainian military intelligence is directly involved in this attack,"" he said.

The attack, which killed 144 people, was claimed by an offshoot of the Islamic State group.

Ukraine has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack.

We reported earlier that Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Now, we are hearing that on Friday Russia arrested more than 20 people in connection with the attack.

Mr Bortnikov repeated Russia's assertion, for which it has not provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack that killed more than 140 people in March.

Ukraine has dismissed the allegation as ""absurd"".

Vladimir Putin arrived for a two-day visit in Belarus on Wednesday, where he will discuss nuclear weapons with his ally Alexander Lukashenko.

Belarus started taking delivery of such Russian warheads - shorter-range less powerful nuclear weapons that could potentially be used on the battlefield - in June last year.

It marked the first movement of such warheads since the fall of the Soviet Union, some of which are three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

Vladimir Putin's call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, broadcast through Kremlin briefings to Reuters, should be treated with caution.

Its real aim may be to fragment European support for Ukraine ahead of a peace conference next month in Switzerland.

Ukraine's defence against Russia has lasted for more than two years and interest and patience is wearing thin in some European countries.

Putin is a master at spotting weakness and exploiting it. If he can sow more doubt into the minds of European leaders and populations, Putin knows that he will weaken Ukraine.

The Russian leader has regularly tried to pose as a peacenik since he launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, accusing Volodymyr Zelensky and Nato of forcing war on him.

But he also knows that the conditions he lays out for peace negotiations are unacceptable to the US, Ukraine's main backer, and will be ignored.

Underpinning Putin's offers of peace talks are tactics designed to fragment European support for Kyiv.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has visited the northeast region of Kharkiv amid Russia's renewed offensive in the region.

""The entire city and region of Kharkiv deserve our support, gratitude, and respect, as does every Ukrainian community and person who refuses to give in to the enemy,"" he wrote on X.

Sergey Viktorovich, the Russian foreign minister, has accused Ukraine of already using weapons supplied by the US to attack targets beyond its territory, in what he called ""the conflict zone and against civilian infrastructure"".

Russia has repeatedly said that Western arms shipment will only prolong the conflict and will not change the situation at the battlefield.

The Biden administration insists that US-supplied weapons should not be used beyond Ukrainian territories.

Romanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against a Romanian citizen accused of treason and spying for Russia for more than two years, they said on Friday.

The country's anti-organised crime prosecuting unit, DIICOT, said in a statement the suspect ""collected military information and took photographs of military equipment and staff movements in the border area with Ukraine which he then sent to diplomats from the Russian embassy in Bucharest"".

The alleged surveillance occurred near Tulcea, the southeastern Romanian county - near the country's border with Ukraine - beginning in 2022.

A Romanian court has approved the suspect's arrest for 30 days pending the criminal investigation

The US has interrogated claims by Britain's defence secretary that China was providing Russia with ""lethal aid"" for its war in Ukraine.

Grant Shapps on Wednesday said he had ""evidence"" of China providing or preparing to provide Russia with ""lethal aid"" for the Kremlin to use in its war against Ukraine.

But US national security adviser Jake Sullivan refuted the allegation, saying Washington had not observed that China had directly provided weapons to Russia.

""We have not seen that to date. I look forward to speaking with the UK to make sure that we have a common operating picture,"" Sullivan said.

Beijing on Thursday condemned what it called ""baseless and irresponsible statements made by British politicians"".

Ukraine used Atacms missiles to destroy a space radar in a strike on Crime, sources on the occupied peninsula said.

The Crimean Wind channel said the large Soviet military antenna was struck near the city of Alushta on the eastern coast.

At least six US-supplied Atacms hit the facility, where ""high-ranking military personnel... were located at the moment"", the Telegram channel wrote.

Russia's defence ministry claimed that the missile attack was repelled with its air defence forces shooting down at least three Atacms.

""Explosions were heard in almost all regions of Crimea. Russian air defences were active in many, but they were not very effective,"" Crimean Wind said.

Atesh, a pro-Ukrainian partisan group, claimed that there were many casualties, but said it was too early to confirm the damage to the radar centre.

The number of people locked up in Russian prisons dropped by 58,000 last year, Russian independent media reported on Friday.

The report said that some 105,000 prisoners were released between 2022-2023, citing data published in the official journal of Russia's prison service.

Russia started to recruit convicts to fight in Ukraine in 2022, when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the late head of the Wagner mercenary group, began to offer prisoners a pardon if they survived six months at the front.

Mr Prigozhin, who was killed in a plane crash last year, said he had recruited 50,000 prisoners for Wagner.

The first batch of Ukrainian Armed Forces pilots have graduated from F-16 training at an Arizona military base, an Air National Guard spokesman has said.

Capt. Eric Hannigan would not confirm how many have graduated or the exact date of graduation ""out of abundance of caution for their safety"".

The pilots are now headed to Europe for additional training, according to a person with knowledge of their movements.

Ukraine is set to receive more than 60 F-16s from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.

A Ukrainian missile attack has killed two people near Crimea's Simferopol, the head of the Russian-annexed territory has said

Sergei Aksyonov said the missile hit an empty building near Alushta on the peninsula's Black Sea coast.

It came as Russia's defence ministry claimed that their air defences had intercepted three US-donated long-range Atacms missiles over Crimea, reported TASS news agency. Three Ukrainian sea drones firing towards the peninsula were also struck by Moscow's forces, the ministry further claimed.

Ukraine has not issued an official statement.

Unofficial Ukrainian military bloggers reported a number of targets had been hit throughout the peninsula.

Russian bloggers on the peninsula wrote that not all incoming missiles had been intercepted.

We reported earlier than Russia has now seized more than half of the border town Vovchansk amid its renewed ground offensive (see post at 8:29 am).

Read the Telegraph's full frontline dispatch here.

The US should lift its ""absolutely unfair"" ban on the Ukrainian army using American-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia, Ukraine's top national security official has said.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko said that lifting the restriction ""would be beneficial"" for Ukraine and could help to thwart Moscow's renewed offensive.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has said that any strikes in Russian territory would be strictly for ""defence"".

Washington has argued the ban was necessary to avoid further escalation with Moscow.

The United States is expected to announce an additional $275 million (£234 million) in military aid for Ukraine on Friday as Kyiv struggles to hold off Russian advances in the Kharkiv region, said two US officials.

This will be the fourth instalment of military aid for Ukraine after US Congress last month passed a $61 billion (£48 billion) major military aid package, following a six month delay during which Russia gained advantage on the battlefield.

It comes as the Biden administration promised to supply a regular flow of weapons and to ensure they reach the front lines as swiftly as possible.

Russian forces now control more than half the territory of border town Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, a Russian MP has said.

Viktor Vodolatskiy added that the towns of Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk would be Russia's next major targets once it takes over Vovchansk.

Fears that Russia would mount an attack on any Nato member are unfounded, the Hungarian prime minister has said.

Viktor Orban said on Friday that the war in Ukraine, now in its third year, highlights the limitations of Russia's military power.

""I do not consider it logical that Russia, which cannot even defeat Ukraine, would all of a sudden come and swallow the Western world whole,"" said Orban. ""The chances of this are extremely slim.""

Hungary, a member of the European Union and Nato, has refused to provide military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

We reported earlier that the head of Russia's Federal Security Service accused Ukraine of being ""directly involved"" in the attack on a concert hall near Moscow (see post at 7:47am).

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre in March and US officials said they had intelligence showing it was carried out by the network's Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan.

Russian spy chief, Alexander Bortnikov, has now accused Nato of enabling the transfer of militants from terror groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan to Ukraine to help push back against Russian forces.

The Kharkiv region is still recovering after being hit by multiple Russian attacks, said Ukraine's president.

Volodymyr Zelensky said that one of Ukraine's largest printing facilities was struck in the attack, killing and injuring a number of people.

""Book storage and equipment were destroyed by fire. Many Ukrainian publishers had their books printed there...Russia want to burn and destroy all aspects of life,"" Zelensky wrote on X.

Ukrainian military intelligence was instrumental in a fatal attack on a concert hall near Moscow, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service has said.

Alexander Bortnikov said an investigation was ongoing, but it was ""already safe to say that Ukrainian military intelligence is directly involved in this attack,"" he said.

The attack, which killed 144 people, was claimed by an offshoot of the Islamic State group.

Ukraine has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack.

Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has proven more palatable than many Western leaders feared when the right-wing politician - some even called her a neo-fascist - became Italy's prime minister in 2022. After all, she and her hard-right Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) party belong in the same political stable as the likes of France's Marine le Pen and the National Rally.

On the campaign trail, Ms Meloni breathed fire against many of the European Union's (EU) cherished values, including LGBTQIA rights and the 'Brussels bureaucrats' themselves. She also expressed sympathy, like other right-wingers, with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

But in office, she has proved to be a model citizen of the European, G7 and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Ms Meloni hasn't emulated the EU delinquent Viktor Orbán, Hungary's prime minister, as many expected. She has fully supported Brussels and NATO in backing Ukraine against Russia and has bolstered Italy's alliance with the United States.

She also seems to share some of the EU's views on immigration - though her critics would probably say that's more because she has brought Brussels into her orbit than vice versa.

Last July, Ms Meloni, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte signed a memorandum of understanding with Tunisian President Kais Saied. The EU agreed to direct budgetary support and accelerated EU funding related to macroeconomic stability, economy and trade, renewable energies, and people-to-people contacts.

In exchange, Tunisia agreed to cooperate with the EU on migration control. In particular, it would prevent migrant departures by sea, address migrant smuggling and trafficking, and assist in returning foreigners seeking to reach Europe from Tunisia to their home countries. In turn, the EU promised to enhance Tunisian citizens' mobility to its member states.

The agreement was controversial in the EU, with some member states saying they weren't properly consulted before it was reached. Their concern included Ms Von der Leyen doing a deal with Mr Saied, who has been dragging Tunisia down the slippery slope of autocracy.

Ms Meloni has focused much attention on Tunisia - visiting it for the fourth time last month - apparently for two main reasons.

One is to establish Italy as a hub of African energy. The other is that Tunisia is a major launchpad to Europe for irregular migrants, and Italy is a leading destination. Although in 2024, Libya has been the main departure point and Spain the main point of arrival, many irregular immigrants make landfall in Italy. Lucio Malan, the Italian Senate's chief whip, recently said, 'Sicily is closer to Tunisia than Sicily is to Rome.'

Controlling migration is probably one of the main drivers of Ms Meloni's Africa policy. Among her other surprises was the first Italy-Africa summit in Rome in January, under the theme 'A Bridge for Common Growth'. It attracted 20 African government leaders and representatives from 46 countries - including Mr Saied. Also in attendance were leaders of the African Union (AU), African Development Bank, EU and International Monetary Fund.

The summit inaugurated the year of Italy's G7 presidency and allowed Ms Meloni to punt her so-called Mattei Plan for Africa, ostensibly based on the 'cooperation as equals' principle. It has six pillars - education, health, energy, water, agriculture and infrastructure.

In her speech to the summit, Ms Meloni underscored energy, saying Italy's goal was 'to help African nations that are interested in producing enough energy to meet their own needs and then exporting the excess to Europe, combining two needs: Africa's need to develop this production and generate wealth, and Europe's need to ensure new energy supply routes.'

She said Italy had been working for some time with the EU on building the connection infrastructure for this energy bridge, citing for example the ELMED electricity interconnection between Italy and Tunisia, and the new SoutH2 Corridor to transport hydrogen from North Africa to central Europe, passing through Italy.

Ms Meloni said the Mattei Plan aimed to unleash Africa's potential and guarantee Africa's youth 'the right not to be forced to emigrate, and not to have to cut your roots in search of a better life, which is increasingly difficult to achieve in Europe.'

The EU representatives generally welcomed Italy's plan. Ms Von der Leyen praised it as consistent with the European Global Gateway initiative, which includes a Europe-Africa investment package of €150 billion. As has been observed, it will be essential to integrate the Mattei Plan into an EU frame, as the €5.5 billion announced by Ms Meloni isn't enough to develop a continent-wide strategy.

In his response, AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Mahamat lamented Italy's lack of consultation with Africa before announcing the Mattei Plan. Yet he apparently agreed with her in principle that the only effective strategy for managing migratory flows was 'transforming the vast regions of poverty, exclusion and human suffering into a space of prosperity and development.'

There have been other criticisms. A group of mainly environmental African non-governmental organisations rebuked Italy for not consulting civil society and for focusing the plan on fossil fuels. Other critics expressed concern about the EU jeopardising its values by collaborating with the likes of Mr Saied, and for essentially buying the support of African countries to keep migrants at bay.

Some are suspicious of Ms Von der Leyen's support for the Mattei Plan, noting she faces a difficult re-election next month, against growing support for EU anti-immigrant right-wing parties.

Ms Meloni did win a rather unexpected endorsement from African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina, who met her the day after the summit. He declared that the African Development Bank was ready to work with the Italian government because 'the Mattei Plan fits into the priorities of the Bank ... You can count on the African Development Bank as your partner of choice.'

Mr Adesina's approval suggested to Italy's Istituto Affari Internazionali that despite its many faults, Ms Meloni's plan could be salvaged by wider consultation within Africa, not just with elites, and integrating it into a broader European framework.

Reporting Criteria Scope This document outlines the basis of preparation for our ESG performance indicators ('KPI's) which are available on investors.vodafone.com/esgaddendum. In preparing the ESG-related information and KPIs, Vodafone has made a number of key judgements, estimations and assumptions. The processes, methodologies and topics involved are complex. The ESG data, models and methodologies used are often relatively new, are rapidly evolving and are not of the same standard as those available in the context of financial information, nor are they subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, comparable benchmarks, or globally accepted accounting principles. It is not possible to rely on historical data as a strong indicator of future trajectories, in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models and methodologies are also likely to be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, and we expect industry guidance, standards, market practice and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. We also face challenges in relation to the ability to access data on a timely basis and the lack of consistency and comparability between data that is available. This means the ESG-related forward-looking statements, information and targets discussed in our Annual Report carry an additional degree of inherent risk and uncertainty. In light of uncertainty as to the nature of future policy and market response to climate change and other ESG-related topics, including between regions, and the effectiveness of any such response, and as market practice and data quality and availability

develops, Vodafone may have to update the models and/or methodologies it uses, or alter its approach to ESG analysis and may be required to amend, update and recalculate its ESG disclosures and assessments in the future, its ESG ambitions, goals, commitments and/or targets or its evaluation of its progress towards its ESG ambitions, goals, commitments and/or targets. Restatements of ESG data may mean it is not reconcilable or comparable year on year. With the exception of the metrics outlined in the Assurance section, the information contained within this document and our ESG Addendum, collectively our ESG data, has not been independently verified or assured. All the information included in our ESG data has been taken from sources which we deem reliable. While all reasonable care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of the data, Vodafone has not arranged for independent verification of the data with respect to its accuracy or completeness. Further information on methodologies is included in the reporting methodology sections of this document. This report includes information on: - Operating companies in the countries where we had operational control during the year 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024: Albania, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Turkey, UK and Vodacom Group and its subsidiaries in the DRC, Egypt, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania; and - Shared operations in Albania, Egypt, Hungary, India, Romania and Spain known as Vodafone Intelligent Solutions ('_VOIS') and other group operations including Vodafone Business and Vodafone Automotive.

This report excludes information on the following unless otherwise stated in the exceptions section below: - Joint ventures where Vodafone does not have operational control: VodafoneZiggo in the Netherlands, TPG Telecom in Australia, Vodafone Idea in India and Vantage Towers and its subsidiaries in Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Romania and Spain; - Associates where we do not have operational control: Safaricom in Kenya and Ethiopia, and Indus Towers in India; - Partner Market networks in which Vodafone neither has any equity interests nor holds an operating license, including those Partner Markets that operate under the Vodafone brand; - Countries in which we are required to hold an operating licence in order to provide local customer support to multinational enterprise customers but where we neither own nor operate any licensed telecommunications network infrastructure; and - Retail stores that are Vodafone-branded by way of franchise and exclusive dealer arrangements but are not owned or operated by Vodafone.

Exceptions to the reporting scope: - Our joint ventures and associates where we don't have operational control which are included in our Scope 3 GHG emissions based on our ownership as at 31 March 2024; - Retail stores where we don't have operational control which are included in our Scope 3 GHG emissions, - M-Pesa customer numbers, which includes 100% of our associate Safaricom in Kenya and Ethiopia; and - V-hub unique user number and target, which include 100% of our joint venture VodafoneZiggo in the Netherlands. Portfolio changes The inclusion or exclusion of data from subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates that have been acquired or sold, or where there is a change in control or ownership that results in a change in operational control (as defined in the GHG Protocol), is determined by the date that the transaction in question is formally concluded with all approvals received. The impact of transactions completed in the year ended 31 March 2023 are detailed in the methodology for each metric in this document. There have been no transactions completed during the year ended 31 March 2024. The impact of transactions announced but not yet completed are reflected as performance from discontinued operations. When those transactions complete we will restate our data in accordance with the above policy.

Under 'IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' our operations in Italy and Spain have been classified as discontinued operations and are reported as such in our financial statements. All other Group activities are reported as continuing operations. This disaggregation has also been reflected in our ESG reporting across all reporting periods. In a limited number of circumstances, data granularity was not available to disaggregate the information relating to discontinued operations. Where this is the case it is noted in the ESG Addendum in relevant footnotes to the data. Estimates and Assumptions The reported information on our operations is based on actual performance data for the period. Where actual data is not available, we have used estimates or assumptions based on actual trends. More information on these estimates or assumptions is set out in the reporting methodology sections for each metric. Data This document includes selected ESG data which should be read alongside the full ESG dataset in our ESG Addendum.

Assurance: Independent Limited Assurance Report to Vodafone Group Plc KPMG LLP (""KPMG"" or ""we"") were engaged by Vodafone Group plc (""Vodafone"") to provide limited assurance over the Selected Information described below for the year ended 31 March 2024. Our conclusion Based on the work we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information has not been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. This conclusion is to be read in the context of the remainder of this report, in particular the inherent limitations explained below and this report's intended use. Selected Information The scope of our work includes only the information included within the External ESG Assurance table on page 55 of Vodafone's Annual Report and Accounts and in Vodafone's ESG Addendum marked with the symbol ^ (""the Report"") for the year ended 31 March 2024 (""the Selected Information"") and also listed in Appendix 1. We have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, over any other information that may be included in the Report or displayed on Vodafone's website for the current period or for previous periods unless otherwise indicated. Reporting Criteria The Reporting Criteria we used to form our judgements is the ESG Addendum Methodology as set out at

Our responsibilities Our responsibility is to plan and perform our work to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information has been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria and to report to Vodafone in the form of an independent limited assurance conclusion based on the work performed and the evidence obtained. Assurance standards applied We conducted our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (""ISAE (UK) 3000"") issued by the Financial Reporting Council and in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions information included within the Selected Information, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (""ISAE 3410""), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Those standards require that we obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence on which to base our conclusion.

https://www.vodafone.com/about-vodafone/reporting- centre/sustainability-reports (""the Reporting Criteria""). The Selected Information needs to be read together with

the Reporting Criteria. Inherent limitations

The nature of non-financial information; the absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw; and the methods and precision used to determine non-financial information, allow for different, but acceptable evaluation and measurement techniques and can result in materially different measurements, affecting comparability between entities and over time. The Reporting Criteria has been developed to assist Vodafone in providing the Selected Information only. As a result, the Selected Information may not be suitable for another purpose. Directors' responsibilities The Directors of Vodafone are responsible for: - designing, operating and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; - selecting and/or developing objective Reporting Criteria; - measuring and reporting the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; and - the contents and statements contained within the Report and the Reporting Criteria.

Independence, professional standards and quality control We comply with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (""ICAEW"") Code of Ethics, which includes independence, and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, that are at least as demanding as the applicable provisions of the IESBA Code of Ethics. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1 Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Summary of work performed A limited assurance engagement involves planning and performing procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to obtain a meaningful level of assurance over the Selected Information as a basis for our limited assurance conclusion. Planning the engagement involves assessing whether the Reporting Criteria are suitable for the purposes of our limited assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on our judgement, on our understanding of the Selected Information and other engagement circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise.

The procedures performed included: - conducting interviews with Vodafone's management to obtain an understanding of the key processes, systems and controls in place over the preparation of the Selected Information; - selected limited substantive testing, including agreeing a selection of the Selected Information to source documentation; - considering the appropriateness of the carbon conversion factor calculations and other unit conversion factor calculations used by reference to widely recognised and established conversion factors; - reperforming a selection of the calculations used to prepare the Selected Information; - performing analytical procedures over a selection of the Selected Information, including a comparison to the prior period having due regard to changes in the business; and - reading the narrative accompanying the Selected Information in the Report with regard to the Reporting Criteria, and for consistency with our findings. The work performed in a limited assurance engagement varies in nature and timing from, and is less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

Our work did not include testing the accuracy of the purchase volumes in Vodafone's Supply Chain IT system and Devices dataset, which were used in calculating Total Scope 3 GHG

emissions (million tonnes CO 2 e). This report's intended use

Greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions Reporting Criteria GHG emissions are calculated in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (million tonnes CO 2 e) and reported in accordance with the GHG Protocol Standards, UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting ('SECR') requirements, RE100 Technical Guidance and the Carbon Disclosure Standards Board ('CDSB') framework. We have applied the operational control approach for the accounting of our GHG emissions and the scope of the data collected is based on this method. This is defined as operations where we have control over how energy is being used (and therefore associated services). Emissions from operations where we do not have operational control but have a financial interest i.e. shareholding, or are part of our wider value chain (e.g. suppliers) where we do not have a financial interest, are accounted for within our Scope 3 GHG emissions. Standards and guidance Our methodology for the reporting of GHG emissions has been developed using the following standards and guidance: GHG Protocol standards and guidance, including the Corporate Standard (revised edition); Scope 2 Guidance and Scope 3 Calculation Guidance; and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard; RE100 Technical Criteria (December 2022); and The Climate Disclosure Standards Board Climate Change Reporting Framework (January 2022).

Digital technology has a huge role to play in enabling the climate transition; helping reduce carbon emissions and underpinning climate adaptation technologies. Recognising that technology can create its own impact on our climate and nature, we strive to minimise the environmental footprint of our operations, value chain and products and services. Reducing our environmental impact and helping to decarbonise society is an integral part of Vodafone's purpose. This year, the need for a green digital transition became ever-more urgent, as the global climate and energy crises deepened. We are working towards achieving reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2040 across our global operations. We continue to drive energy efficiency in our operations and seek to match our energy with electricity from renewable sources. Digital technology has been recognised as a key enabler of carbon savings. We work with our business customers to build solutions reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower their planetary impact. As use of technology expands, we are playing our part in the growing circular economy. We aim to minimise the impact of the waste we create from our own operations and encourage greater re-use, repair and recycling of the hardware our customers use.

Portfolio changes We include performance data from newly acquired businesses at the end of their first full year of new ownership in line with our policy on reporting environmental data. In terms of setting a revised baseline to reflect acquisitions, disposals or a change of control, our policy is determined as follows: - Acquisitions are built into the baseline using either actual or estimated data at the end of their first full year of ownership based on our assessment of operational control; - Disposals are removed from the baseline in the year of disposal if part of the Group for less than six months or in the following year if part of the Group for more than six months; - Where prior year data has been re-stated to correct any significant errors identified this will be noted along with the reason for re-statement; and - Where there is an update to the calculation methodology that causes a significant change in the previously stated data all prior year information will be restated. This year we have restated our GHG emissions across all prior periods to our 2020 baseline to reflect: - Disposals of Hungary and Ghana on 31 January 2023 and 20 February 2023 respectively; and - The change in control of the Vantage Towers Group on 23 March 2023 from a subsidiary to a joint venture. On 13 December 2022 ownership of Egypt was transferred to the Vodacom Group. Comparative information has been re-presented to reflect the move of Vodafone Egypt from the 'Other markets' segment to the Africa segment from 1 April 2023.

Data gathering process and methods Energy usage data is based on invoices from our energy suppliers, which in some cases include the supplier's estimated readings. Increasingly, we measure our energy consumption through smart metering, a technology that uses mobile communications to collect real-time consumption data from energy meters. Under this approach we have accounted for 100% of emissions from the operations over which we have operational control within the Scope 1 and 2 footprints. We report on data collected using local market actual or estimates sourced from invoices, purchasing requisitions or direct data measurements. Emissions from our joint ventures and associates are accounted for within our Scope 3 GHG emissions. Where actual data is not available for the full reporting period, data for the missing period is estimated using an appropriate and reasonable estimation method (for example, extrapolation using the year-to-date monthly average, or based on prior year data for the corresponding time period). Due to a time lag in the availability of actual data, the majority of GHG emissions data has been estimated for the month of March 2024. If in our future year reporting the reconciliation of estimated data against actual data identifies a material error we will restate our reporting in accordance with our policy for restatement.

Scope 1 GHG emissions These are emissions from operations under our operational control and include those from: - Diesel, petrol and other fuel used by cars and commercial vehicles owned by Vodafone or leased for six months or more; - Natural gas and other heating fuels used for space heating and hot water in our premises; - Diesel and petrol used for generators in off-grid areas, or where back-up capacity is required; and - Fugitive releases of refrigerants or fire suppressants used for air-conditioning or fire control systems in network buildings and offices. Conversion factors from the UK government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been used to calculate GHG emissions from other fuel sources such as diesel, petrol, natural gas and fuel oil as well as those from vehicles. Scope 2 GHG emissions These are emissions from electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased to power our networks, technology centres, offices and retail stores. We report two different Scope 2 emission values: one using a 'market-based' method and one using a 'location-based' method. The market-based method applies if we have operating companies in any countries where energy certificates or supplier- specific information are available. The method involves using an emissions factor that is specific to the electricity purchased. The location-based method involves using an average emissions

Market-based emissions Emissions are calculated using a kWh to CO 2 e conversion factor based on one of the following sources (in order of the GHG Protocol hierarchy): - Supplier conversion factors specific to our contract; these include some markets where supplies are 100% renewable, and where we have sought evidence of singularity of supply; - Residual mix figures for 2022 - where the conversion factor reflects the removal of certificates, contracts and supplier- specific factors claimed by other organisations; and - Location-based conversion factors as described below. Location-based emissions Emissions are calculated using a kWh to CO 2 e conversion factor provided in the 2023 International Energy Agency ('IEA') emissions factor database which uses data for the 2022 calendar year where available (2021 is used if not available). For the calculation of emissions from district heating in Germany the Department for Food and Rural Affairs ('DEFRA') emissions factor is applied. The emission factor for South Africa has been restated across all reported periods to apply the factor provided by the state-owned electricity provider to more accurately reflect the emissions.

Renewable electricity We consider grid electricity to be purchased from renewable sources if the grid electricity used in our operation is matched with renewable energy certificates ('RECs'). RECs certify that power has been generated and added to the grid from a renewable source such as wind, solar or hydro. In addition, we purchase a growing proportion of our electricity directly from renewable generators through Power Purchase Agreements ('PPAs'). We also generate a small proportion of the electricity we use ourselves, for example through rooftop solar panels. In some of the European countries where we operate, markets for purchasing renewable electricity (traceable using RECs) are not available. We match electricity used in these countries with RECs originating from grid-connected neighbouring markets. This means that the electricity used by our network in Europe is 100% matched with renewable sources. The European markets where we match the grid electricity we use with RECs for the financial year ending 31 March 2024 are: Albania, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom. Renewable electricity includes all renewable electricity from third-party suppliers which is traceable to Vodafone through a signed contract or provision of surrendered RECs. Renewable electricity excludes RECs passed on and retired by a third party.

Scope 3 GHG emissions The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard defines 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions. All 15 categories have been assessed for inclusion within our reporting, where categories are excluded because there are no emissions, this is reviewed annually to ensure it remains valid and as part of our continued efforts to improve transparency and completeness of disclosure for our total GHG emissions footprint. We are committed to continual improvement in the quality and completeness of our Scope 3 emissions data inventory. We partner with carbon accounting specialists at The Carbon Trust to model and calculate our annual Scope 3 emissions. The Carbon Trust are experts in sustainability and carbon reporting who support us in identifying improvements to the completeness and accuracy of the input datasets and making improvements to methodology in line with emerging industry best practice. This year we have completed a review of our methodologies resulting in restatement of our Scope 3 emissions for all reported periods. This was undertaken to improve our data quality and estimation approach alongside the need to reflect portfolio changes and latest developments in industry standards and emission factors. The methodological changes made this year are considered to be insignificant.

As the methodology for measuring Scope 3 GHG emissions is still developing and industry standards may change, we will continue to evolve our methodology, and this may result in in a need to amend or update our disclosures and/or our ESG ambitions, goals, commitments and/or targets or our evaluation against these. We calculate our emissions for upstream and downstream transportation and distribution using a hybrid approach of spend-based and product specific data, which does not differentiate between upstream and downstream transportation and distribution activities. In 2022 we improved our calculation methodology to enable emissions from capital goods and transportation and distribution to be reported separately from purchased goods and services. Prior to 2022, emissions from capital goods were included in the data reported for purchased goods and services together with emissions from all transportation and distribution. The table below provides a breakdown of our Scope 3 emissions alongside an overview of the methodology for our Scope 3 calculations. Where the UK Government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ('BEIS') emission factors are referenced, these refer to the conversion factors for company reporting of greenhouse gas emissions (published by BEIS in June 2023).

We use a hybrid approach to calculating Scope 3 category 1 emissions. For the majority of purchased goods and services, we use a spend-based approach whereby our procurement spend on each product category is multiplied by a corresponding environmentally extended input-output ('EEIO') emission factor (drawn from third-party EEIO datasets). For a sub-set of purchased goods, namely mobile phone devices that are purchased from original manufacturers for retail to our customers, we use a product-specific approach, whereby the units of product purchased are multiplied by a corresponding cradle-to-gate product carbon footprint ('PCF'). The PCF data is drawn from EcoRating datasets. For a sub-set of purchased services procured from 20 service-based suppliers, we use a supplier-specific approach whereby our procurement spend on each supplier is multiplied by the supplier's organisational carbon footprint intensity (market-based Scope 1 and 2 plus upstream Scope 3 emissions) in tCO 2 e/mUSD, as disclosed through publicly available 2023 Climate Disclosure Project ('CDP') disclosures. We use a spend-based approach to calculating the emissions for capital goods purchased. Capital expenditure on each type of capital good is multiplied by a corresponding EEIO emission factor (drawn from third-party EEIO datasets).

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Further improvements to the mapping of EcoRating PCF data (to mobile handset models based on storage capacity and handset type e.g. smart or feature phone) applied to calculate emissions using the product-specific approach; - Increased the number of suppliers where CDP disclosure data has been used; and; - Recategorisation of spend data from Category 1 to Category 8 where the spend item relates to upstream leased assets..

1. Purchased goods and services Emissions from the extraction, production and transportation of goods and services purchased by Vodafone (through operating expenditure).

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Recategorisation of spend data from Category 2 to Category 8 where the spend relates to upstream leased assets.

2. Capital Goods Emissions from the extraction, production and transportation of capital goods purchased by Vodafone (through capital expenditure).

Upstream fuel and energy emissions are calculated by applying BEIS emission factors for upstream well-to-tank ('WTT') and transmission and distribution ('T&D') emissions to Vodafone's fuel and energy consumption data. International Energy Agency ('IEA') emissions factors are applied for international electricity consumption.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

3. Fuel and energy- related activities Emissions from the extraction, production and transportation of fuels and energy purchased by Vodafone and not already included in Scopes 1 and 2. It includes emissions from electricity transmission and distribution. 4. Upstream transportation and distribution Emissions from the transportation and distribution of products purchased by Vodafone between the manufacturing location of our Tier 1 suppliers and our own operations.

We use a hybrid approach to calculating Scope 3 category 4 emissions. For mobile phone devices that are purchased from original manufacturers for retail to our customers, we continued to use our original methodology for calculating these emissions. For these, we estimate the weight of products purchased based on desk-based research and multiply this by the distance between China (representing the origin location for the majority of our products) and the top five countries of purchased goods (representing the market destination of the majority of our products). A modal split of 5% air freight and 95% shipping has been assumed and average BEIS emission factors for freight have been applied to estimate emissions. For all other goods purchased and sold, we estimate associated transportation and distribution emissions using a spend-based approach. These estimates account for transportation and distribution irrespective of whether it is upstream (category 4) or downstream (category 9). Therefore category 9 emissions are accounted for within this category. Where CDP data is used to calculate category 1 emissions we do not disaggregate emissions data relating to transportation and distribution for those purchased services. The emissions from transportation and distribution related to those services are therefore accounted for within our category 1 emissions.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

Emissions are estimated by applying BEIS emission factors to tonnage of waste generated by our operations across all of our operating companies (not including post-consumer waste from our products). Where actual waste tonnage is not available, this is estimated by extrapolating a per full-time equivalent ('FTE') employee waste tonnage estimate, based on actual tonnage data for our UK operating company. Air travel emissions are calculated based on the distance travelled multiplied by the air travel emission factor for the corresponding ticket-class and flight length. Emission factors are drawn from the BEIS emission factors. The emissions factors applied were drawn from BEIS, for domestic (UK internal), international (non-UK), and long-haul and short-haul (to/from UK) flights. Data for the distance travelled is extracted from the database of Vodafone's third-party travel booking provider. Distance data is included for both outward and return legs of all flights booked with an outward departure date within the reporting period. Rail travel emissions are calculated based on the distance travelled multiplied by a BEIS rail travel emission factor. Other business travel emissions are calculated based on Vodafone's spend (on road, bus and taxi travel) as measured through our travel expenses system, multiplied by corresponding EEIO conversion factors. Emissions are estimated by multiplying the total number of employees (average FTE) per country by the estimated average distance travelled per day, estimated number of working days per year, estimated days working from the office and home per week, estimated proportion travelling by a particular mode of travel and energy use at home, and BEIS emission factors.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

5. Waste generated in operations Emissions from the disposal and treatment of waste generated by our activities. 6. Business travel Emissions from transportation of employees for business- related flights (air travel) and business-related travel by road and rail.

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Calculating hotel emissions based on number of nights stayed, previously this was based on spend, multiplied by corresponding EEIO or BEIS conversion factors.

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Inclusion of working from home emissions based on the hybrid working policies in each of our operating companies.

7. Employee commuting Transportation of

employees between their homes and worksites and energy use from home working during the reporting year.

The most significant upstream leased assets in Vodafone's value chain are radio base station sites leased from third-party tower companies. At the majority of these leased sites, Vodafone owns and operates radio equipment. The electricity consumed by equipment owned and operated by Vodafone falls within our operational control boundary and is therefore accounted for in our Scope 2 emissions. The energy consumption of ancillary equipment (or 'passive' equipment) at these leased sites, which is owned and operated by the third-party landlord, is not within Vodafone's operational control boundary, and therefore contributes to Vodafone's Scope 3 category 8 emissions. These emissions are estimated based on the number of leased radio base station sites multiplied by the estimated average energy consumption of passive equipment, multiplied by the location-based emissions factor corresponding to the location of the site. The estimated average energy consumption of passive equipment is based on energy consumption data (electricity and diesel) of passive equipment at radio base station sites owned and operated by Vodafone. Where transportation of sold products is paid for by Vodafone (through the procurement of services from third-party logistics suppliers), the corresponding emissions are accounted for within Scope 3 category 4. On the basis that downstream transportation and distribution activities (which generally occur within country) are not significant compared to upstream transportation and distribution activities (which generally involve international freight), the emissions for this category have not been disaggregated to account for downstream transportation and distribution separately from upstream transportation and distribution. Therefore, no emissions are reported against this category. Vodafone does not sell products that require further processing before use. Therefore, this category of emissions is not relevant and no emissions are reported against this category.

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Recategorisation of spend data from Categories 1 and 2 to Category 8 where the spend relates to upstream leased assets.

8. Upstream leased assets Operation of assets leased by Vodafone, including third-party network sites. This includes the relevant sites leased from tower companies. 9. Downstream transportation and distribution Transportation of sold products from the point of sale to the customer. 10. Processing of sold products Downstream processing of sold products (prior to use phase).

There were no changes to the reporting for this category for this year.

These emissions include the emissions from electricity required to use electronic devices that Vodafone sells, including mobile phone handsets, fixed line equipment (such as broadband routers) and other electronic devices. Emissions are calculated based on the number of devices, multiplied by the estimated average lifetime energy use of each device, multiplied by the location-based emissions factor in the country of product sale. The estimated average lifetime energy use of mobile phone handsets is drawn from EcoRating data sets, if available, or else from desk-based research of publicly available information on the energy use of similar devices. For all other devices, use-phase electricity consumption is estimated based on proxies for the average energy use of similar products (based on publicly available information). These emissions do not include the emissions from the use of SIM cards sold by Vodafone, on the basis that SIM cards can be used in a wide range of equipment with a wide range of electricity consumption and do not themselves create emissions. These emissions are calculated based on the estimated weight of products sold by end-of-life disposal channel (based on average rate of waste electronic recycling versus landfill), multiplied by the corresponding BEIS emission factor for each end-of-life channel. The average rate of waste electronic recycling versus landfill is calculated using the average recycling rates in four of our markets (Germany, UK, Italy, Spain), based on desk research of publicly available information.

Changes made to the methodology this year include: - Improved use-phase electricity consumption data based on storage capacity of mobile handsets.

11. Use of sold products

Emissions from the use of goods and services sold by Vodafone, principally from the energy used by network equipment, such as routers, and the energy required to charge mobile devices. 12. End-of-life treatment of sold products Waste disposal and treatment of products sold by the reporting company at the end of their life. 13. Downstream leased assets Emissions from the use of products or equipment leased to third parties.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

No emissions have previously been reported against this category.

We have reported emissions from downstream leased assets for the first time this year and in all reported periods. This is based on the leased revenue reported in our financial statements. Emissions are calculated using the number of leased assets, multiplied by the lifetime electricity consumption and the corresponding IEA emission factor.

Retail stores where Vodafone has operational control (including ability to specify the equipment installed in the store and how it is operated, irrespective of whether the store is owned or leased by Vodafone) fall within our operational control boundary and are therefore accounted for in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Vodafone operates a franchise model in some of its markets, where retail stores are not under Vodafone's operational control, and where the energy required to operate the store is primarily determined by the decisions of a third-party franchisee. These franchised retail stores fall outside Vodafone's operational boundary and are therefore accounted for in our Scope 3 emissions. These emissions are calculated by multiplying average energy use per retail store (based on the average electricity and natural gas use in retail stores in Germany) by the corresponding IEA and BEIS emission factors for that country, multiplied by number of franchise retail stores in each market. Emissions from joint ventures and associates are calculated based on Vodafone's equity ownership and the corresponding proportion of the company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In FY24, these investments included network operators in Australia, the Netherlands, India, Ethiopia, Kenya and infrastructure partners in India. The company's carbon emissions are based on the latest available annual carbon footprint data, either provided directly to Vodafone through engagement with the investee company, or from publicly disclosed company carbon reporting for the latest available reporting year. A proportion of the total annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions of the investee company is reported based on our equity share as at the end of the reporting period. Scope 3 emissions from investee companies are not currently included in this category as we have not yet been able to determine the significance of the Scope 3 emissions to each investee company's total emissions.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

14. Franchises Operation of franchises in the reporting year, not included in Scope 1 or 2.

There were no significant changes to the methodology for this category for this year.

15. Investments Emissions from activities financed by Vodafone through investments in joint ventures and associates where Vodafone has significant influence.

Carbon enablement Carbon enablement - GHG savings for customers enabled by our green digital solutions Over the last few years Vodafone has been estimating the potential global carbon abatement impact of their products and services with the support of The Carbon Trust, an external consultant. Carbon abatement, also known as enablement or avoided emissions, is an estimated measurement of carbon savings resulting from the use of products and services. It is specifically the measurement of the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise have occurred had these connections and services in these use cases not been in place. An estimate of the carbon abatement impact for each use case is calculated by multiplying product volume (e.g., number of IoT connections) by a carbon abatement factor. A use case is a proposition within Vodafone's business customer portfolio that has the potential to reduce carbon emissions (e.g., Smart metering, Fleet management, Health-care monitoring). Vodafone has been working with The Carbon Trust to define and identify these use cases, develop methodologies and estimate the associated carbon abatement impact by applying a carbon factor to each use case. The Carbon Trust is a third-party expert in the field of carbon measurement, and we rely on their expertise to determine the carbon abatement potential of the use case.

The carbon abatement factor for each use case is mainly informed by either an external study, an internal Vodafone study or documented expert assumptions. For use cases where the location of the connection is relevant to the carbon abatement factor, a country-specific input is included (e.g., for Fleet Management, the carbon abatement factor includes average annual emissions for a car in the country where the connection is located). For countries where insufficient data is available, proxies or other assumptions have been substituted. We strive to develop measures of carbon enablement through collaboration with carbon experts and technology sector industry peers. As the science of measuring carbon enablement develops, we recognise ongoing limitations with our current approach, and will continue to evolve our methodology to address them in light of emerging industry standards. These limitations include: - We measure carbon abatement on a gross estimate basis. This means that the carbon emissions avoided are not net of the lifecycle carbon emissions of the product or service itself. - We do not account for any potential rebound effects. This means we do not measure any possible emissions associated with unintended changes of behaviour that could result from the implementation of the products or services. As the methodology for measuring carbon enablement emissions is still developing and industry standards may change, we will continue to evolve our methodology. This may result in a need to amend or update our disclosures and/or our ESG ambitions, goals, commitments and/or targets or our evaluation of progress against these.

We do not claim to be solely attributable for the carbon emissions avoided by the products and services we sell. Rather, we calculate carbon abatement so that we can better understand the potential scale of the carbon emissions that could be avoided, as a measure of how Vodafone contributes to the decarbonisation of society. Our carbon enablement metric has not been externally assured this year. Our carbon enablement target and metrics are currently under review in light of evolving methodologies for measuring the 'net carbon impact' of digital solutions.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.5058823529411764,454249501,94,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has proven more palatable than many Western leaders feared when this right-wing politician -- some even called her a neo-fascist -- became Italy's prime minister in 2022. After all, she and her hard-right Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) party belong in the same political stable as the likes of France's Marine le Pen and the National Rally.

On the campaign trail, Meloni breathed fire against many of the European Union's (EU) cherished values, including LGBTQIA+ rights and the ""Brussels bureaucrats"" themselves. She also expressed sympathy, like other right-wingers, with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Read more in Daily Maverick: War in Ukraine news hub

But in office, she has proved to be a model citizen of the European, G7 and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato). Meloni hasn't emulated the EU delinquent Viktor Orbán, Hungary's prime minister, as many expected. She has fully supported Brussels and Nato in backing Ukraine against Russia and has bolstered Italy's alliance with the United States.

She also seems to share some of the EU's views on immigration -- though her critics would probably say that's more because she has brought Brussels into her orbit than vice versa.

Last July, Meloni, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte signed a memorandum of understanding with Tunisian President Kais Saied. The EU agreed to direct budgetary support and accelerated EU funding related to macroeconomic stability, economy and trade, renewable energies, and people-to-people contacts.

In exchange, Tunisia agreed to cooperate with the EU on migration control. In particular, it would prevent migrant departures by sea, address migrant smuggling and trafficking, and assist in returning foreigners seeking to reach Europe from Tunisia, to their home countries. In turn, the EU promised to enhance Tunisian citizens' mobility to its member states.

The agreement was controversial in the EU, with some member states saying they weren't properly consulted before it was reached. Their concern included Von der Leyen doing a deal with Saied, who has been dragging Tunisia down the slippery slope of autocracy.

Meloni has focused much attention on Tunisia -- visiting it for the fourth time last month -- apparently for two main reasons.

One is to establish Italy as a hub of African energy. The other is that Tunisia is a major launchpad to Europe for irregular migrants, and Italy is a leading destination. Although in 2024, Libya has been the main departure point and Spain the main point of arrival, many irregular immigrants make landfall in Italy. Lucio Malan, the Italian Senate's chief whip, recently said, ""Sicily is closer to Tunisia than Sicily is to Rome"".

Controlling migration is probably one of the main drivers of Meloni's Africa policy. Among her other surprises was the first Italy-Africa summit in Rome in January, under the theme ""A Bridge for Common Growth"". It attracted 20 African government leaders and representatives from 46 countries -- including Saied. Also in attendance were leaders of the African Union (AU), African Development Bank, EU and International Monetary Fund.

The summit inaugurated the year of Italy's G7 presidency and allowed Meloni to punt her so-called Mattei Plan for Africa, ostensibly based on the 'cooperation as equals' principle. It has six pillars -- education, health, energy, water, agriculture and infrastructure.

In her speech to the summit, Meloni underscored energy, saying Italy's goal was ""to help African nations that are interested in producing enough energy to meet their own needs and then exporting the excess to Europe, combining two needs: Africa's need to develop this production and generate wealth, and Europe's need to ensure new energy supply routes"".

She said Italy had been working for some time with the EU on building the connection infrastructure for this energy bridge, citing for example the ELMED electricity interconnection between Italy and Tunisia, and the new SoutH2 Corridor to transport hydrogen from North Africa to central Europe, passing through Italy.

Meloni said the Mattei Plan aimed to unleash Africa's potential and guarantee Africa's youth ""the right not to be forced to emigrate, and not to have to cut your roots in search of a better life, which is increasingly difficult to achieve in Europe"".

The EU representatives generally welcomed Italy's plan. Von der Leyen praised it as consistent with the European Global Gateway initiative, which includes a Europe-Africa investment package of €150-billion. As has been observed, it will be essential to integrate the Mattei Plan into an EU frame, as the €5.5-billion announced by Meloni isn't enough to develop a continent-wide strategy.

In his response, AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat lamented Italy's lack of consultation with Africa before announcing the Mattei Plan. Yet he apparently agreed with her in principle that the only effective strategy for managing migratory flows was ""transforming the vast regions of poverty, exclusion and human suffering into a space of prosperity and development"".

There have been other criticisms. A group of mainly environmental African non-governmental organisations rebuked Italy for not consulting civil society and for focusing the plan on fossil fuels. Other critics expressed concern about the EU jeopardising its values by collaborating with the likes of Saied, and for essentially buying the support of African countries to keep migrants at bay.

Some are suspicious of Von der Leyen's support for the Mattei Plan, noting she faces a difficult re-election next month, against growing support for EU anti-immigrant right-wing parties.

Meloni did win a rather unexpected endorsement from African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina, who met her the day after the summit. He declared that the African Development Bank was ready to work with the Italian government because ""the Mattei Plan fits into the priorities of the Bank ...

In the last debate before the European parliamentary election, incumbent European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen faced off against four other contenders on a range of issues.

The European Union (EU) will hold elections from June 6 to 9, during which citizens of each of the 27 nations comprising the EU will elect their representatives to the European Parliament for a five-year term.

After the elections, all 27 EU member countries nominate a candidate whose European political party wins the most seats. The parliament must approve the nominee by an absolute majority. If the nominee does not get enough votes, the countries must put forward another candidate.

Two European right-wing parties, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and Identity and Democracy (ID), decided not to nominate their lead candidates for the commission presidency, so they did not participate in the debate.

The ECR said in a statement that it was never ""in favor"" of the lead candidate system and the system ""was never fit.""

The incumbent's party, the European People's Party, is a center-right party, while the parties that nominated the four other candidates ranged from center and left-of-center to left-wing.

The four other candidates currently hold various offices in the EU.

On the issue of jobs and the economy, the candidate placed great importance on fighting poverty.

Ms. von der Leyen touted the minimum wage already implemented in the EU to counter poverty. She also talked about the EU's plans to improve housing, stating that the union will invest 81 billion euros ($88 billion) in the renovation of houses and 21 billion euros ($23 billion) in social housing.

Regarding defense and security, the commission president said the EU needs to support Ukraine because it is a democracy fighting against autocracy. She also stressed the need for the EU to ramp up its defense spending.

Defense can be founded on the national level or the European level, Ms. von der Leyen said. She believes it is time to fund it at the European level, and the member states and the parliament should focus on such funding.

The Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel was horrible, Ms. von der Leyen said and acknowledged that ""Israel has the right to defend itself.""

""But it has to do this in line with international humanitarian law,"" she explained.

Since the situation in Gaza is catastrophic, the EU quadrupled its humanitarian aid to the region and continues to pay the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Ms. von der Leyen added.

Earlier this year, several countries paused their funding for UNRWA, over Israeli allegations that a number of the agency's employees were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.

The incumbent also stressed that the two-state solution is the only solution for Israel and Palestine.

When explaining her position on illegal immigration, Ms. von der Leyen expressed her support for extending protection to asylum seekers but stressed that decisions about who enters the EU and under what circumstances must belong to the EU, not to the smugglers and traffickers.

She said the EU also needs ""legal pathways for safe and secure ways to come to the European Union,"" but those ""are not eligible for asylum have to go back home.""

When addressing the economic issue, Mr. Baier emphasized the issue of poverty. He said, ""One of the main reasons for poverty is the increase of housing prices and rents."" The EU should oblige its member countries ""to put rent caps and to forbid evictions,"" Mr.Baier pointed out.

When discussing defense and security, Mr. Baier said, ""The most urgent threat to security is the ecological disaster."" For this reason, the EU should prioritize ""political solutions to the conflicts"" instead of spending huge amounts of money on defense.

Europe needs disarmament, peace, and stability, he added. He urged the cancellation of Ukraine's debt, stating that the country is fighting for values commonly shared by the EU.

When discussing the economy and jobs, Mr. Schmit stressed the importance of improving the daily living conditions of European citizens.

""We need to give them decent wages, good working conditions ... quality jobs to women. We have to ensure equality is [applied] in the labor world,"" he said.

""The minimum wage is one of the great achievements to give people decent wages all over Europe,"" the jobs commissioner pointed out.

On the issue of defense, Mr. Schmit stressed the need for bold support for Ukraine.

""If we are not supporting Ukraine boldly, the Russians will be directly at our borders. They have transformed their economy into a war economy,"" Mr. Schmit warned.

He said he supports peace but not on conditions dictated by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Regarding climate policies, Mr. Schmit maintained that ""the right climate policy can enhance a new type of sustainable growth"" and will not affect economic growth.

To achieve that, the EU needs huge investments to transform and decarbonize its industry, agriculture, and people's daily lives, Mr. Schmit stressed.

When speaking on the topic of defense and security, Mr. Gozi called for 100 billion euros to develop and boost a European defense industry.

However, defense and security go hand in hand with education and knowledge, Mr. Gozi explained. Therefore, ""for every euro that you spend on defense, you must add one euro for catch-up education and knowledge.""

""Either you're powerful to sit at the table and to define your interest, or you'll find yourself in the menu decided in Beijing and Washington,"" he noted.

On the issue of illegal immigration, Mr. Gozi stressed the need to support economic immigration.

Speaking on economic issues, Ms. Reintke emphasized there is no contradiction between climate and economy. ""In order to be economically successful and competitive in the future ... we need to really push for the possibilities they are in the green economy.""

Regarding the EU's defense and security, there are ""too many only nationally focused projects,"" Ms. Reintke said. She proposed creating a defense fund at the EU level.

She also called for the end of unanimity voting rule in the European Council, an EU body comprised of 27 leaders of member countries, ""when it comes to foreign and security policy."" To illustrate her point, Ms. Reintke gave an example of Hungary, whose leader used the veto power when voting in the European Council.

Regarding defense and security, Ms. Reintke said that ""the biggest threat to our security ... is the rise of the far right."" She blamed ""far-right politicians"" for trying to ""destabilize"" the union and of cooperating with Russia and China to try to ""undermine"" the EU's interests.

""Europe has to resist this far-right threat,"" Ms. Reintke said.

When discussing climate policies, Ms. Reintke noted that the agriculture policy needs to be revamped because the farmers cannot live off what they're producing anymore. She proposed a change in the subsidies' distribution system.

The EU also needs massive investment in infrastructure to make the transition to climate neutrality possible, Ms. Reintke said.

In addition to tackling climate change, the EU needs a ""circular economy,"" which can be achieved through recycling resources, thus reducing the dependence on raw materials imported from other countries, Ms. Reintke said.

The ETS is an EU system that requires those that generate carbon emissions to pay for them. The system imposes a limit on greenhouse gases emitted by the system participants. Companies covered by the system can buy emission allowances on the EU carbon market and trade them with other companies as needed.

If a company reduces its emissions, it can either keep the spare allowances to use in the future or sell them, according to the EU's website.

To make the European Green Deal a success, Ms. Reintke recommended getting people involved in the green transition for themselves. She touted Germany's project to build small solar panels on balconies.

People can see that they're producing their own electricity, which is good for the climate and their pockets, Ms. Reintke explained. These small steps can take all people on board with the Green Deal, she added.

She also supports immigration. ""We are an aging continent, we will need migration if we want to sustain our hospitals if we want to be economically successful. But we need to talk about how we can manage migration we need to create legal pathways,"" Ms. Reintke said.

""We need a resilient asylum system so that we make sure that the chaos on our external borders ends.""",theepochtimes.com,news,www.theepochtimes.com,,0.1843137254901961,454245995,1,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/24/id5656456-2024-05-23T160313Z_1_LWD501923052024RP1_RTRWNEV_E_5019-EU-ELECTION-DEBATE.jpg,eng-9587120

Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has proven more palatable than many Western leaders feared when this right-wing politician - some even called her a neo-fascist - became Italy's prime minister in 2022. After all, she and her hard-right Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) party belong in the same political stable as the likes of France's Marine le Pen and the National Rally.

On the campaign trail, Meloni breathed fire against many of the European Union's (EU) cherished values, including LGBTQIA rights and the 'Brussels bureaucrats' themselves. She also expressed sympathy, like other right-wingers, with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

But in office she has proved to be a model citizen of the European, G7 and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Meloni hasn't emulated the EU delinquent Viktor Orbán, Hungary's prime minister, as many expected. She has fully supported Brussels and NATO in backing Ukraine against Russia and has bolstered Italy's alliance with the United States.

She also seems to share some of the EU's views on immigration - though her critics would probably say that's more because she has brought Brussels into her orbit than vice versa.

Last July, Meloni, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte signed a memorandum of understanding with Tunisian President Kais Saied. The EU agreed to direct budgetary support and accelerated EU funding related to macroeconomic stability, economy and trade, renewable energies, and people-to-people contacts.

In exchange, Tunisia agreed to cooperate with the EU on migration control. In particular, it would prevent migrant departures by sea, address migrant smuggling and trafficking, and assist in returning foreigners seeking to reach Europe from Tunisia, to their home countries. In turn, the EU promised to enhance Tunisian citizens' mobility to its member states.

The agreement was controversial in the EU, with some member states saying they weren't properly consulted before it was reached. Their concern included Von der Leyen doing a deal with Saied, who has been dragging Tunisia down the slippery slope of autocracy.

Meloni has focused much attention on Tunisia - visiting it for the fourth time last month - apparently for two main reasons.

One is to establish Italy as a hub of African energy. The other is that Tunisia is a major launchpad to Europe for irregular migrants, and Italy is a leading destination. Although in 2024, Libya has been the main departure point and Spain the main point of arrival, many irregular immigrants make landfall in Italy. Lucio Malan, the Italian Senate's chief whip, recently said, 'Sicily is closer to Tunisia than Sicily is to Rome.'

Controlling migration is probably one of the main drivers of Meloni's Africa policy. Among her other surprises was the first Italy-Africa summit in Rome in January, under the theme 'A Bridge for Common Growth'. It attracted 20 African government leaders and representatives from 46 countries - including Saied. Also in attendance were leaders of the African Union (AU), African Development Bank, EU and International Monetary Fund.

The summit inaugurated the year of Italy's G7 presidency and allowed Meloni to punt her so-called Mattei Plan for Africa, ostensibly based on the 'cooperation as equals' principle. It has six pillars - education, health, energy, water, agriculture and infrastructure.

In her speech to the summit, Meloni underscored energy, saying Italy's goal was 'to help African nations that are interested in producing enough energy to meet their own needs and then exporting the excess to Europe, combining two needs: Africa's need to develop this production and generate wealth, and Europe's need to ensure new energy supply routes.'

She said Italy had been working for some time with the EU on building the connection infrastructure for this energy bridge, citing for example the ELMED electricity interconnection between Italy and Tunisia, and the new SoutH2 Corridor to transport hydrogen from North Africa to central Europe, passing through Italy.

Meloni said Mattei Plan aimed to unleash Africa's potential and guarantee Africa's youth 'the right not to be forced to emigrate, and not to have to cut your roots in search of a better life, which is increasingly difficult to achieve in Europe.'

The EU representatives generally welcomed Italy's plan. Von der Leyen praised it as consistent with the European Global Gateway initiative, which includes a Europe-Africa investment package of €150 billion. As has been observed, it will be essential to integrate the Mattei Plan into an EU frame, as the €5.5 billion announced by Meloni isn't enough to develop a continent-wide strategy.

In his response, AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat lamented Italy's lack of consultation with Africa before announcing the Mattei Plan. Yet he apparently agreed with her in principle that the only effective strategy for managing migratory flows was 'transforming the vast regions of poverty, exclusion and human suffering into a space of prosperity and development.'

There have been other criticisms. A group of mainly environmental African non-governmental organisations rebuked Italy for not consulting civil society and for focusing the plan on fossil fuels. Other critics expressed concern about the EU jeopardising its values by collaborating with the likes of Saied, and for essentially buying the support of African countries to keep migrants at bay.

Some are suspicious of Von der Leyen's support for the Mattei Plan, noting she faces a difficult re-election next month, against growing support for EU anti-immigrant right-wing parties.

Meloni did win a rather unexpected endorsement from African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina, who met her the day after the summit. He declared that the African Development Bank was ready to work with the Italian government because 'the Mattei Plan fits into the priorities of the Bank ... You can count on the African Development Bank as your partner of choice.'

May 24 (Interfax) - Ukraine received emergency assistance from the power grids of Romania, Poland and Slovakia for 15 hours, from 9:00 a.m. to midnight, on Thursday due to a considerable power shortage, Ukrainian media outlets said, citing information circulated by the Ukrenergo power grid operator on social media.

Ukraine also received emergency assistance from Poland and Romania from 2:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. on Friday.

Further emergency assistance may be provided during the day as well, media outlets cited the Energy Ministry as saying on social media.

Electricity imports from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova have risen 9% to 15,315 MWh. Electricity exports from Ukraine have long been absent.

Ukrenergo confirms that hourly power cut schedules are in effect for industrial consumers and households across Ukraine throughout the day on Friday.

Adverse weather cut power supply to 19 populated localities (around 3,100 consumers) in the Sumy region in the morning, Ukrenergo said.

They outlined the situation in the region and agreed urgent action is necessary for the integration, implying close cooperation between the relevant ministries, transmission system operators and regulatory bodies.

Burdened, like the rest of Europe, by turbulences in the electricity market amid the coronavirus pandemic, energy crisis and Ukraine war, the Western Balkans face multiple challenges in the segment in their accession to the European Union, too. Many of the regulations piling up come into force automatically for member states, while the transposition in the countries of the region is more complex and conducted through the Energy Community.

The latest batch is the package of EU directives and regulations on the electricity market design reform, which was discussed at one of the panels within Belgrade Energy Forum. ""Our first task, to be able to talk about the energy transition at all, is market coupling. Without it the energy transition simply cannot come to fruition in the right way, a fast switch to a large quantity of renewable sources,"" according to moderator and Chief Operating Officer of Serbia's SEEPEX electricity exchange Dejan Stojčevski.

Most countries in the region only rolled out day-ahead markets last year, while the intraday one is still a long shot, he noted. ""Serbia does have both, but we can't speak about big liquidity. Bosnia and Herzegovina still didn't established an organized market, and it is not likely it would within the next two years,"" Stojčevski estimated.

He also pointed to decarbonization obligations and said the EU is changing its legal framework for hydrogen, balancing, energy storage, long-term contracts and other segments.

Allowing negative prices in trading on exchanges is also important for market coupling

Importantly, market coupling is a basic condition for the countries in the region to get an exemption from the EU's CO2 import tax, within the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. After the ongoing trial period, during which the levy is only calculated, it will be charged from January 1, 2026. In addition, the Western Balkans will need to introduce an emission trading system (ETS) or systems by the end of 2029.

Stojčevski expressed doubt that all the processes can be completed on time. He also stressed that allowing negative prices in electricity trading is important for market coupling, for the region to align with the EU.

From the crash in prices, demand and output during the pandemic lockdowns to stunning price surges during the energy crisis to the current episodes of prices plunging deeply below zero, the key is always in interconnections and having more markets in sequence, said Zoran Vujasinović, policy officer responsible for electricity market codes in the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). ""Better transmission capacities provide that there's always someone to absorb or offer,"" he underscored.

The establishment of the balancing market is slow

As for the electricity balancing market, it is opening very slowly for the Western Balkans while even in Europe it's not materializing so easily, Vujasinović said. Turning to EU integration, he highlighted the fact that bigger and more coordinated regions have better access and larger available capacities.

Vujasinović suggested to the countries in the region to conduct a simpler coupling process, through so-called NTCs (net transfer capacities), based on bilateral exchange analysis. ""That, too, is a huge task,"" he said. In his view, it would take several years, after which it is possible to turn to coupling with Central Europe and the methodology based on flow-based market coupling.

Traders in exchanges are already buying and selling power for the delivery in 2026 and it is important that they know how the system will work then, said the Head of Electricity in Energy Community Secretariat Jasmina Trhulj.

By adding the Electricity Integration Package (EIP) to their legal frameworks, the Western Balkans will practically become full EU members. They accepted the obligation in December 2022 and the task was supposed to be completed by the end of last year. No contracting party in the region delivered it, but they are working on it, Trhulj asserted.

The relevant law in Serbia was finished for the most part already in October, and it is expected to be adopted in autumn, she added. The next step is implementation. Jasmina Trhulj highlighted the bilateral market coupling initiatives that were launched by Serbia and Hungary, and Montenegro and Italy, and pointed out that only Bosnia and Herzegovina still has no such project while the three remaining contracting parties are working with Greece.

Jérôme Le Page, Chair of the Electricity Committee in the Energy Traders Europe association, said the changes that the EU introduced with its market reform aren't fundamental but that it just structured it a little bit differently. ""It's about providing long-term signals for investors in power generation, storage and renewables but also providing good signals and safety nets for consumers,"" he stated.

The EU is demanding from the countries of the region to achieve in two years what it took twenty years there

He especially praised how the EU regulated the segment of long-term market-based instruments - power purchase agreements (PPAs) and forward contracts. ""They are the backbone of how we trade, how the system works,"" Le Page underscored.

In addition, regulated schemes for subsidizing fossil-free facilities via contracts for difference (CfDs) enable supporting the developers by determining a lower limit for prices and capping them for consumers, he explained.

Now the system must start functioning across borders as well, Le Page said.

Agreeing with the other panelists, he opined that for a good integration pace in the Western Balkans it is necessary for state authorities to establish close cooperation with the Energy Community Secretariat, their transmission system operators (TSOs) and the operators of markets and bourses.

Le Page acknowledged it is difficult to fulfill obligations such as the one on carbon pricing. The EU is practically demanding from the countries of the region to achieve in two years what it took twenty years there, he added. #That's not easy and that's almost unfair. And yet that's the policy that is out there,"" he asserted.

On the other hand, work on the abovementioned tasks matters a lot, Le Page said. ""But if you haven't shown any sign of going for progress, the authorities aren't going to be very lenient,"" he warned.

The Alpine-Adriatic Danube Power Exchange - Adex is doing its part of the job on the organized electricity market level, its Chief Executive Officer Anže Predovnik said. Its goal is market coupling and uniforming the trading and operational conditions on all markets within the group, he stressed. Predovnik, who also runs the Slovenian BSP SouthPool exchange, added that resources are currently optimized.

Adex Group wants to enable robust, transparent price signals, he said. On top of the work to create a joint bourse with SEEPEX and the Hungarian HUPX, on which they recently signed a deal, the company is helping the exchanges in Montenegro and North Macedonia within the aforementioned market coupling initiatives, Predovnik revealed.

""We will create the biggest energy hub or energy trading holding in the region. With this setup, being at the border of the current EU and Energy Community countries, we can serve as a bridge and help the integration of the Energy Community countries with all the expertise we collected in the last couple of years and decades in the EU, going through all the market couplings from 2012,"" HUPX CEO Mátyás Vajta said.

He stressed that the focus is shifting from the day-ahead to the intraday market as well as to renewables and that algorithmic trading is strengthening. Most newcomers on HUPX leans on algo and the trend is kicking in in the surrounding region, too, in Vajta's words.

""To tackle all these in one step in this region will be really challenging,"" the head of the Budapest power bourse underscored and concluded that it is urgent to act and that market coupling is the most important.

To respond to it and achieve green and low-carbon transition, it calls for support from more quality production capacity.

The new energy production capacity around the world today falls significantly short of meeting the demand of the market, especially huge latent demand in developing countries.

The narrative of so-called ""overcapacity"" in China's new energy industry as well as the protectionist measures stemming from it hinder the development of green industries of the world and the concerted efforts made by the international community to respond to climate change.

The development of China's new energy industry has made significant contributions to the global green and low-carbon transition, in response to the needs of countries to alleviate energy crises and address climate change.

In 2022, China's exports of wind power and photovoltaic products resulted in a reduction of approximately 573 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions for other countries.

According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, over the past decade, the average cost of electricity per kWh from wind power and photovoltaic projects around the world has cumulatively decreased by more than 60 percent and 80 percent respectively, and a significant portion of this achievement is attributed to China's innovation, manufacturing, and engineering projects.

China's green capacity has brought positive spillover effects to other countries. In Kazakhstan, the 60 MW Shelek Wind Farm invested and built by a Chinese company helps reduce over 160,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions on an annual basis. In the United Arab Emirates, the Al Dhafra Solar Project contracted by a Chinese company supplies electricity to 200,000 households and reduces carbon emissions by 2.4 million tons each year.

The claim that China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity just cannot hold water.

In order to achieve the temperature goals set out in the Paris Agreement and help countries fulfill their commitments to peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, it is needed to increase investment in the clean energy sector and enhance the supply of new energy products globally.

For instance, the new energy vehicle (NEV) industry is seeing a huge demand globally. According to the International Energy Agency, the global demand for NEVs is expected to reach 45 million units by 2030.

Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto pointed out that overcapacity doesn't exist, and there is indeed a lack of capacity.

China's green capacity poses no threat to the development of other countries' industries. Instead, it promotes their industrial growth through extensive cooperation and healthy competition.

According to Peter Fischer, chief economist of the Swiss daily Neue Zurcher Zeitung, it is with China's assistance that the West has gained access to more cost-effective solar panels and wind turbines. Furthermore, China's innovative NEVs can drive the transformation of European car manufacturers, which ultimately benefits consumers.

An article on the website of The Diplomat said that Southeast Asian nations are actively courting Chinese electric vehicle companies in a collaboration that not only strengthens the imperative transition away from fossil fuel vehicles, but also fuels economic growth through technological exchange.

It is contradictory to emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change while labeling China's renewable energy industry as ""overcapacity."" Such accusations of ""overcapacity"" are merely excuses for protectionism. Facts have long indicated that such practice benefits no one and will eventually backfire.

Adopting protectionist policies and setting up trade barriers not only disrupts the global investment landscape of green industries but also hampers the efficient allocation of green resources worldwide.

This leads to inefficient capacity and redundant construction, increasing the cost of low-carbon transition in countries that adopt these policies. Furthermore, it will hinder the global development of clean energy and impose significant negative impacts on the world economy.

As Bloomberg recently argued, despite implementing steel protectionist measures over the past decade, Washington has failed to prevent the decline in employment within the U.S. metal manufacturing industry. Instead, these measures have increased costs in other sectors of the U.S. economy and reduced competitiveness of the industry. If these measures were to be applied to the new energy sector, they would further weaken America's ability to tackle climate change.

Blocking technological progress and suppressing high-quality production capacity is not the right path for economic development. China stands by its basic national policy of opening up and is ready to work with all parties to uphold fair competition and benefit from cooperation together.

It is hoped that relevant countries will maintain an open mindset, abide by market economy principles and international economic and trade rules, and provide a fair, transparent, open, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises.",en.people.cn,news,"People's Daily, China",,0.3725490196078431,454229644,4,,eng-9602333

""No one exports electricity when there is a deficit in the system. We operate in a single European power system, and there are no export contracts. But there are technical flows, when we do not consume electricity and there is a surplus, it flows to the EU,"" explains Ivan Plachkov, chairman of the supervisory board of Kyivenergo.

A conspiracy theory is being spread among Ukrainians: that electricity is being sold to the EU when we are short of it ourselves. This fake is easy to refute, as all data on exports and imports are published on a special website, the European platform for collecting data on electricity production, transportation, and consumption.

However, those who believe in this conspiracy theory find confirmation even in the platform's data. Instead of the ""commercial exchange"" section (actually trade), they open the section of the site about physical flows (which cannot be eliminated as long as we are part of a single energy system) and claim that this is exports.

One such post on Facebook has more than 3 thousand shares. The author of the post took a picture of her computer screen, which shows the ""physical flow"" section, and stated that ""Ukraine is always selling electricity to Romania and Moldova."" Although this information is easy to refute, most of those who commented on her post seemed to believe it.

The author of the post shows a graph for May 13 and claims that on this day Ukraine allegedly sold electricity to Romania. However, if you open the graph of commercial exchange of electricity with Romania for this day, you will see that on the contrary, on May 13, Ukraine bought electricity from Romania between 00:00 and 07:00 and from 18:00 and 00:00.

Ukraine also bought electricity from Moldova on May 13, but did not sell it. You can check this information here. In the panel on the left, you can select a country and see data on exports and imports with Ukraine.

It is worth noting that the power system does not have the ability to accumulate current in large volumes. That is, if there is too much electricity today (more than Ukrainians consume), it cannot be ""saved"" for a rainy day. It is either necessary to reduce production (which is impossible now) or sell it abroad. To sharply reduce or increase production (when consumption is growing), energy is used from hydroelectric power plants and thermal power plants. It was these stations that Russia destroyed during its recent attacks on the energy sector.

Therefore, if electricity was sold in March, it could not have affected the deficit in May. Moreover, even within a single day, the Ukrainian energy system can have both a surplus (for example, in the afternoon, when solar generation is actively working and consumption is low) and a deficit (in the morning and evening). And the fact that there will be a surplus of current at lunchtime will not help cover the evening peak in consumption.

For example, let's look at information on electricity exports and imports on a weekday. On May 17, there were schedules of power outages from 00:00 to 08:00 and from 19:00 to 24:00. That is, it was during this period that there was a deficit that could not be covered even by imports of electricity. And if you look at the volume of trade, it was during these periods that most electricity was bought. At the same time, no electricity was sold at all. Ukraine imports electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova. Exports to these countries are also possible.

Ukraine did not sell a single kWh to Romania that day. Instead, electricity was imported: from 00:00 to 09:00 and from 14:00 to 22:00. Moreover, at 6 am, the volume of imports (due to peak consumption) increased fivefold - from 50 to 255 MW.

No kWh was sold to Slovakia that day, but electricity was bought throughout the day. Mostly during the morning (at 7, 8 am) and evening (until 22:00) peaks.

We bought electricity from Poland from 6 am to 7 pm (and did not sell it), and from Moldova - throughout the day. There were no exports at all.

Sometimes, to ""confirm"" the sale of electricity, graphs from the Ukrainian Energy Exchange are shown. However, they show sales on the domestic wholesale market. For the industry, market mechanisms have long been in place for both the purchase of electricity and price formation. There are no separate contracts for exports, all data goes through a single European platform.

The blackouts cannot be linked to the tariff decision

Another conspiracy theory is that Ukrainians are being cut off from electricity to justify the tariff increase. In fact, and without any argumentation, the current electricity tariff for Ukrainians (UAH 2.64 per 1 kWh) covers only the delivery. That is, Ukrainians do not pay a single penny for electricity generation.

At the same time, electricity debts continue to grow. That is, consumers do not pay on time even for electricity delivery to their apartments.

""The situation is painfully clear. The goal is to cause more inconvenience to people to reduce resistance to the tariff increase,"" a resident of Zaporizhzhia wrote on her Facebook page. This statement has been actively spreading on social media over the past few days.

Despite the fact that Ukrainians have witnessed the largest attack on the energy sector in recent months, with the lion's share of balancing generation destroyed, some still find it easier to believe that the blackouts are the fault of Ukrainian power engineers or the government, not Russia.

""People are starting to look for someone to blame. There are no commercial sales, there are technical flows that are necessary. They are ten times smaller,"" Plachkov adds.

The situation in the energy sector remains extremely difficult. Right now, the repair campaign at NPPs is underway. In addition, Zaporizhzhia NPP remains under occupation (6 thousand MW), Kakhovka HPP is destroyed, Dnipro HPP is out of operation, and several large thermal power plants have been destroyed. All these are the results of the Russian attack on energy facilities. And while some facilities can indeed be protected, it is virtually impossible to build ""sarcophagi"" and close a large thermal power plant from a direct missile attack. In any case, no country has yet learned how to create such protection. And the very fact of an attack on a thermal power plant is a war crime.

Any search for those responsible for the electricity shortage should begin with reminders of who destroyed part of Ukraine's generation. There is no evidence of any electricity sales during the lockdown. Not a single investigator, power engineer, or official has confirmed even the possibility of such exports. Moreover, Europeans publish all data on commercial electricity exchange, and it would be impossible to hide such information.",eng.obozrevatel.com,news,Obozrevatel,,-0.1764705882352942,454078535,100,https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/5/22/elekroenergiya-elektrika-svitlo-freepik.jpg?size=2010x1050,

When the Yutong bus company have offered us a chance to see their manufacturing plant in Zhangzhou, Henan Province, the Hungary Today team had welcomed this opportunity and prepared for the 7500 km journey to the heart of China. This is a unique, unbiased account of what we have seen and experienced, not a sponsored article.

The basic question we would like our readers to engage with is this: should the EU keep its doors open for Chinese auto-makers, or should it protect its industry with recently proposed protectionist measures, such as tariffs. Ironically, it is the European car industry itself, most notably German car manufacturers who have warned against such measures saying this could seriously backfire. Such an unexpected reaction from those whose interests are apparently being protected by the market-protectionist EU proposals hints at a worrying fact, namely that Brussels' planned measures seem follow a political order-book rather than an industry-driven demand.

The justification for the European Commission's investigation into Chinese car manufacturers could be summed up by EC President Ursula von der Leyen's words: ""Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars. And their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market"". From what we have seen in China this is a serious simplification of why Chinese cars are cheaper while also technologically being on par with European brands. Such opinions are therefore risky not only because they could be viewed as unfair towards Chinese manufacturers themselves, but more importantly, because they call into question the competence of some of the EU's top leaders and could unwittingly jeopardize the competitiveness of the European car industry.

So let us see what else could explain the Chinese automotive industry's success other than ""huge state subsidies"".

Today some 99% of newly commissioned buses in China are powered by so called ""New Energy"", such as hydrogen or electricity, a number that Europe can only dream about. Among them, Yutong bus is the largest bus manufacturer in China and one of the largest in the world. Rebranded from the Zhengzhou Bus Company founded in 1963, Yutong has quickly entered the fast lane: its sales volume of large and medium-sized buses ranked No. 1 in China in 2003 and No. 1 in the world in 2010. Both records have been maintained to this day. In 2022, Yutong Bus successively provided mobility guarantee for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the Qatar World Cup and other international large-scale events.

The four vehicle factories of Yutong have an annual production capacity of over 150,000 vehicles. In terms of the industrial chain, Yutong independently develops and expands key components for their vehicles. At the same time, it cooperates with industry chain partners in electrification, hydrogen fuel and autonomous driving to jointly promote industrial development through innovation.

By 2023, Yutong's bus plant has ranked first in China for 20 consecutive years, with a global market share of over 10%.

In 2019, Yutong won three Busworld awards, including the design and environmental protection, breaking the record of Chinese automakers. Yutong has sold to more than 40 countries and regions, covering the areas of Europe, America, Africa, Asia-Pacific and Middle East.

The production floor at the plant is squeaky clean, large parts of the line are automated and high-tech. The scale of the operation is hard to describe as we have only seen small parts of the plant, but the proportions are massive. The 13.000 employees have huge canteens on site. Watching the interactions between the company's top managers and lower ranking employees the relationship seemed to possess a surprising amount of immediacy in contrast to, let us say, German or Japanese corporate culture. The second most common criticism against Chinese car companies apart from the ""state subsidies"" narrative, namely that they are able to produce cheaply because their employees work in sweatshop-like dangerous conditions, simply does not stack up.

Their technological advancements, abundant work-force, computerized manufacturing, strong emphasis on EV, etc., would explain their competitiveness among other global manufacturers who employ the same techniques. But what gives them the edge? This is a crucial question, and the possible answer came from the presentation by Mr. Allan Yan, Global Brand Senior Manager of Yutong. In his remarks he explained that Chinese automotive manufacturers are put through a ""fierce competition"" for their internal market, which means that only those that come up on top are then able to compete on an international scale. In his words, the Chinese government offers them all the necessary help, but the government also puts the bar very high for domestic companies.

The green targets set by Beijing are exceptionally ambitious, and as far as cars or traffic are concerned, one needs only to take a stroll at a major junction in Beijing or Shanghai to experience the amazing progress they made, and their huge advance over European cities in running their traffic on new energy. The images of smog-choked Chinese cities from only a few years ago are no more.

The race for the domestic market is absolutely crucial in understanding the Chinese manufacturing success: this is where the economy of scale offers an enormous advantage to Chinese brands, where serving a population of nearly 1.5 billion will offer a test environment and economic opportunities that European manufacturers can only dream of. By the time brands like Yutong come to us, they have the development level and resources that few other countries' manufacturers possess.

This also raises the questions as to what motivates them to enter the often frustrating, overregulated policy minefield called the EU market. Their sales here, compared to their domestic market, are relatively modest, but one of Yutong's executives has explained that there is an element of prestige in having success in Europe. Having sales success globally is beneficial for obvious reasons, but making it in Europe counts as a major achievement back in China.

When observing the Chinese giant from close up it becomes obvious that their strength does not merely lie in being so numerous. What is just as important is that they are also pulling essentially in the same direction. Without the latter, the first advantage would be negated. They are disciplined and enormously competitive by nature. Europe needs to match that if it wants to compete with China in the long term, trade protectionism will only work in the short term.

One area where we still have an advantage though is that we in Europe are still the trend-setters, not the Chinese. They, however, have the centuries long strategy to recognize these global trends early, such as green transit policies, and adopt them well before those who had come up with them in the first place.

Speaking to Yutong managers about policy, EU measures, trade-protectionism, etc., one noticed that after a couple of polite remarks they always returned to technology, EV, production and their buses. One had the distinct impression that instead of a group of people who, according to European and US media, are hell-bent on a hostile takeover of our car industry, we were talking to ""bus-people"". Professionals who live and breath buses, and have little appetite to get involved in geopolitics. This is pretty much the opposite of the impression one gets when speaking with European company managers. When you query them about substance, they invariably talk about politics. These ESG-obsessed activist Western company managers then get promptly left behind by their technology and product quality-focused Asian counterparts.

The 57 billion dollars that the Chinese government had reportedly spent on EV subsidies between 2016-2022 is a huge sum, but this is a ""mere"" 8 billion a year for a market of nearly 1.5 billion. To put this into perspective, Germany alone had spent 9.5 billion Euros on subsidizing the purchase of EVs, while its population is 17 times smaller than that of China. As to the topic of market share, Germany manufacturers account for a 17% market share of cars sold in China, while their Chinese counterparts only have a 3% share in Germany. Yutong's managers have also complained about meeting all European regulations when bringing in their buses, only for the goalpost to move as soon as they have fulfilled all the trade-requirements, a phenomenon Hungary is well familiar with, albeit within the political arena.

Hungary had been widely criticized by the international media and some politicians for opening its markets and work-force for manufacturers such as BYD or the battery producer CATL. We did not get a reply to our question whether Yutong had any plans to enter the Hungarian market, but we have been informed that they already have an office in Budapest. It appears that our government is clearly staking their bets on the competition-hungry Chinese car industry coming up on top in its battles with protectionist measures from Brussels, which would subsequently offer Hungary an exceptionally competitive position in the European car industry. Both the government in Budapest as well as the leading German car manufacturers understand that Europe cannot score a victory over the Chinese car industry without seriously damaging its own, and that the only way forward is the hard way: producing better quality, technologically more advanced, greener and cheaper cars than the Chinese do.",hungarytoday.hu,news,Hungary Today,,0.3176470588235294,454077157,13,https://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240516_100345.jpg,

The World Bank's Board of Executive Directors today approved a $35 million loan for the first phase of the Enhancing Energy Security through Power Interconnection and Renewable Energy (ESPIRE) Program for Georgia, Trend reports via the World Bank.

The ESPIRE Program consists of three phases with a potential financing envelope of up to $500 million that seeks to improve Georgia's institutional capacity for the development of submarine cable projects, strengthen Georgia's domestic power transmission system, and establish a direct electricity interconnection between the South Caucasus and Southeast Europe. Additionally, the parallel digital interconnection would reduce internet connection costs, improve bandwidth, and generally enhance international digital connectivity across the Black Sea.

The ESPIRE Program is designed to support the next steps in the preparation of a potential Black Sea Submarine Cable (BSSC) Project, which aims to establish parallel electricity and fiber-optic submarine cable interconnections across the Black Sea, with landing points in Georgia and Romania.

On December 17, 2022, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania, and Hungary signed a strategic partnership agreement that provides for the construction of an energy bridge from the Caucasus region to Europe.

As per the agreement, a 1,000 MW Black Sea Energy submarine electric cable spanning 1,195 kilometers is set to be constructed. The cable is intended to transmit 'green' electricity generated in Azerbaijan, routed through Georgia and the Black Sea to Romania, and further distributed to Hungary and the rest of Europe. This infrastructure will facilitate the supply of up to four gigawatts of green energy.

These hostages represent over 17 nationalities, including five Americans as well as citizens from Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.

Last month, these nations released a joint statement calling for the immediate release of these hostages. But Hamas continues to stall. And given the global geopolitical context, what is Yahya Sinwar's motivation for meeting their demands?

After spending last week in Israel witnessing firsthand the devastation of Oct. 7 and the lasting effects of the ongoing hostage crisis, it is difficult to grasp how U.S. foreign policy is being conducted on this issue.

With each day that passes, the likelihood for the return of these loved ones to their families diminishes. While the vast majority of Americans stand in solidarity with the families who are suffering, the Biden administration's actions to date suggest that securing the release of American victims of Hamas is not a policy priority, which only emboldens Sinwar's position.

What can our leaders do to affect the release of these hostages? The answer is quite simple: Support Israel and pressure Hamas.

First, President Biden should acknowledge his responsibility to the American citizens who are being held hostage. They should be at the top of his policy priority list, not buried in the ninth point of a ten-point White House briefing on policy toward the Middle East, as we saw on May 13.

Second, Biden's actions must align with that priority. The hostages are Sinwar's leverage to survive Israel's justified response to a huge terrorist massacre against civilians. U.S. actions and statements that give Sinwar confidence he may survive, even without giving up hostages, guarantee that Hamas will keep holding our hostages. Why would Sinwar give up his leverage if our own president is willing to help him achieve his objective via unilateral pressure on Israel?

With American hostages as his first responsibility, Biden must unequivocally stand by Israel, not criticize, hamper, and marginalize its effort to bring home all the hostages. Most recently, the U.S. paused the shipment of over 3,500 bombs to Israel and threatened sanctions against a unit of the Israel Defense Force. Public opposition to a campaign to eliminate Hamas infrastructure in Rafah gives Sinwar all the hope he needs to hold out longer.

A clear-eyed view of why Israel is pushing into Rafah and the continuous work they have undertaken to minimize the humanitarian impact of the conflict should be articulated by the Biden Administration. Indeed, the Israeli military has expended tremendous energy coordinating the clearance of hundreds of aid trucks per day, restoring water and electricity across parts of Gaza, only to experience one letdown after another due to Sinwar's bad-faith negotiations.

The latitude for Hamas' disingenuous behavior in negotiations has been fueled by wavering support and open condemnation of Israel by its greatest ally, the United States. President Biden and his Administration have placed election politics and a poor interpretation of the extreme left flank of their party above their responsibility to American citizens. As a result, Sinwar feels emboldened. At the same time, one also must consider the role of social media apps like TikTok whose algorithm is disproportionally propagating messages of support for Palestinians and Hamas and spreading antisemitic disinformation about Israel. The propaganda arm of the CCP continues to weaken societal bonds while promoting false narratives.

Let us never forget that Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization, not a legitimate negotiating partner. A group that tortured and massacred women and children in the most brutal ways possible will never negotiate in good faith.

One viable path for Israel to free the hostages is to maximize pressure on Sinwar by going into Rafah and conducting its operation to eradicate Hamas. Tightening the noose around Sinwar and forcing him back to the negotiating table showed signs of success earlier this week.

Biden needs to look in the mirror and remember who he serves. Americans have been taken hostage by a terror organization during an unprovoked invasion of an allied nation. His job is not an easy one -- it requires courage and moral conviction and clarity, something Barack Obama has publicly asserted as a defining reason for his support of Biden.

Biden must commit himself and his administration to bringing home and returning American hostages to their families by standing by Israel instead of undermining it. The alternative is to keep playing both sides of the issue for political purposes, allowing American hostages to die in Hamas's custody.",thehill.com,news,The Hill,,0.0117647058823529,454073714,1,https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/654ae44867ba39.69604492.jpeg?strip=1&w=640,

""There is a lot of interest in this initiative from the European Union. The potential for Azerbaijan and Georgia to create green energy is enormous. Particularly near the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan's wind energy potential is enormous. Hydropower and wind energy development have substantial resources in Georgia.

The professor emphasized that this is the longest submarine cable, which runs through rather deep waters, so technically, it is quite a complicated project. Nevertheless, according to him, the cable enjoys great support from at least four countries, namely Azerbaijan, Georgia, Hungary, and Romania.

Margvelashvili mentioned that this cable will provide a link between the South Caucasus and the European Union, adding that the political aspect of this project is also important.

He also added that it will require significant improvements in the energy sector in Azerbaijan and Georgia.

To note, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania, Hungary, and Georgia signed a strategic partnership agreement on December 17, 2022, which envisages the construction of an energy bridge from the Caucasus region to Europe. Within the framework of the agreement reached, Black Sea Energy is expected to build a submarine electric cable with a capacity of 1,000 MW and a length of 1,195 kilometers.

Son of famed Georgian keeper David, young Giorgi started out at the nation's top side, Dinamo Tbilisi, but in four years didn't make a single appearance. Stuck as fourth choice he was then sent off on loan, first to Rustavi where he let in four on his debut, then to Lokomotiv Tbilisi, where he let in another four in his first game. So it hasn't been an easy ride - but his warrior attitude, 1.96m frame and raw talent saw him through. Some solid Europa League displays for Lokomotiv caught the eye, including against Spain's Granada, when Valencia's scouts took notice. Signed by them in 2021 as third choice, he took full advantage when injuries gave him a first-team chance. Today's he's a €35m-rated prospect linked with Premier League clubs.

As a boy Loria fancied himself as a forward, encouraged by his faithful, ever-present dad at matches and training. But a coach saw things differently, put him in goal, and the rest is history. Loria worked his way up to the country's top side, Dinamo Tbilisi, spending 11 successful years there, before setting off on a nine-year career journey through Cyprus, Russia, Germany and back again. Today, despite his veteran status, he's still a regular for Dinamo and the national side. He is rated as a penalty-saving specialist, and always looks to the sky after a save to thank God and his father, who died several years ago. He's also not afraid of getting stuck in, and was sent off, as a substitute, for his part in the playoff final's mass brawl with Greece.

The 25-year-old Gugeshashvili is already playing for his sixth club, and not without success - Qarabag totally dominate in Azerbaijan, and almost knocked Bayer Leverkusen out of the Europa League back in March. His journey to this point began with his first overseas move, from Dinamo Tbilisi to Jagiellonia Białystok in Poland, at the age of just 16, in 2016. He is now firmly established at Qarabag, and will be a reliable back-up for Georgia this summer. His surname is hard to pronounce, so, as a favour to overseas commentators, he sometimes gives them an alternative. During a loan spell at Recreativo Granada in Spain, instead of having his surname on his shirt, he went with Rachveli - meaning a representative of his native region, Racha.

A proper leader, on and off the pitch. In 2017, Kashia, then playing in the Netherlands for Vitesse, wore a rainbow armband to support the nation's Coming Out Day - resulting in a far-right violent protest outside the Georgia FA's headquarters. Georgia fans, media and politicians backed his stance, and, the following year, after Uefa gave him the #EqualGame award, he said: ""I believe in equality for everyone, no matter what you believe in, who you love or who you are ... I will always keep defending equality and equal rights for everyone, wherever I play."" In December 2018, he received the Presidential Order of Excellence from Giorgi Margvelashvili. He also earned applause in the qualification semi-final against Luxembourg when Georgia's former captain Jaba Kankava came on. Kankava hadn't played since 2020 - so Kashia handed over his captain's armband.

Sazonov's mother is Georgian, his father Russia, and he had a dual-nationality upbringing, spending time living in both countries, speaking two languages. When he opted to play for the Georgian Under-21s, then the senior side, some Russian media branded him a traitor. His dad hit back: ""Saba is no traitor! He has two homelands and he simply chose the one of his parents' homelands. I do not see anything criminal in this."" Sazonov was named in the overall best XI after the 2023 Under-21 Euros, and was recognised as the nation's outstanding young talent at the Georgia FA awards that year. He couldn't get to the ceremony due to commitments with Torino, whom he joined from Dynamo Moscow last year - so his mum and dad received it on his behalf.

Kakabadze's uncle Zurab was a well-known handball player in Georgia who went on to become president of the nation's Handball Association - but little Otar was having none of it, much preferring football, whatever his uncle said. ""In my street nobody played handball,"" he said. ""We all just kicked the ball between two stones."" He was a forward back then, scoring freely, and as he grew began to excel down the right and left flanks. But the coach of Georgia's Under-17 side, Vasil Maisuradze, spotted his potential to operate from the back instead, and the switch paid off. A hugely potent attacking threat from right-back, he has played club football in Spain, Switzerland and Denmark, and moved to Poland with Cracovia in 2021.

After spending 12 years at the highest level in Russia and Ukraine, earning interest from Premier League clubs, Solomon ""Saba"" Kvirkvelia left Metalist 1925 Kharkiv in 2022 following the Russian invasion. As a two-time Georgian player of the year his next move raised eyebrows: he opted to return to his homeland and join Gagra, a displaced team from Abkhazia who play in Tbilisi due to the ongoing Russia occupation of their region. He offered to play for them for free, and to help develop their young players too. After a spell there he made a move to Neftchi of Azerbaijan - then landed a lucrative contract with his current side in Saudi Arabia, where he has tested his skills against Ronaldo. A valued member of the squad this summer.

After an outstanding display in the Under-17 Euros in 2013, 18-year-old Dvali was signed by Reading from Latvian club Skonto, but problems with his visa meant he never made a breakthrough in England. He was loaned back to Skonto, then to Turkey's Kasimpasa, managed by Georgian legend Shota Arveladze. After that came moves to German, Polish, Russian and Hungarian clubs before he arrived at Apoel in Cyprus in 2022. His form there has been good, earning him his spot in this summer's squad; key qualities include strength, experience and a handy habit of scoring goals. He converted his penalty in the playoff final shootout win over Greece. When he's happy he likes to express his joy with a Georgian dance. One to watch.

Lochoshvili played so well in the 2017 Under-19 Euros that he earned a five-year deal at Dinamo Kyiv, but, partly due to three big injuries inside one year, he failed to break through in Ukraine. He then spent time back with his first club Dinamo Tbilisi and with Slovak club Zilina before making a big move to Austria with Wolfsberger, which proved to be the springboard to Serie A and Cremonese. He made headlines at Wolfsberger in 2022 when he helped save the life of Austrian player Georg Teigl who was left unconscious after a serious on-field collision, and had swallowed his tongue. Lochoshvili's instinctive intervention earned him a Fifa Fair Play award, and the Dignity Cross from the Carinthia state governor.

One game changed everything for Gocholeishvili. A previously little-known player at Saburtalo Tbilisi, he didn't make many waves, or command much attention, until he stepped out for Georgia's Under-21s against England on 16 November 2021. His sparkling all-round display peaked when, in the 65th minute, he dribbled through the defence at high speed and scored the decisive third goal - later named by the Georgia FA as goal of the year. Scouts and agents took interest and last year he moved to Ukraine with Shakhtar on a five-year deal. In his first Champions League game, against Barcelona in November 2023, he again stood out and assisted the only goal - earning a place in the Champions League Team of the Week.

A multiple title-winning left-back: not bad for a 22-year-old. He has already played for four teams in his short career, becoming a champion at all of them: Dinamo Tbilisi and Dinamo Batumi in Georgia, Red Star Belgrade in Serbia, and now at Shakhtar in Ukraine. The Montenegrin forward Stefan Denkovic, who played at Batumi with Azarovi, told Serbia's MozzartSport: ""Azarovi is the best left-back I've played with in my career. And not only that, he's probably one of the best in that role I've seen in football. He has incredible technique, speed and sharp movements."" Azarovi was named Georgia's best young player in 2021; his future looks bright.

Lobzhanidze was laser-focused on football from the age of four, training with older children, and with his father in the street, always dedicated to honing ""my dribbling and my shooting ... I like those kind of skills"". It paid off: from Dinamo Tbilisi he moved to Randers in Denmark in 2017, then spent three years in Turkey before last year's big move to the MLS with Atlanta. Off-field hobbies include getting tattoos - current ones include an angel, Thor's hammer, his birth year and a lightning bolt - and watching NBA. ""For me, Kobe Bryant is the GOAT. I grew up watching Kobe. Now my favourite player is Jayson Tatum."" In November last year, at Atlanta's stadium, he asked his girlfriend, actor Sali Keratishvili, to marry him. She said yes.

Once dubbed ""the Georgian Messi"". He was a proper prodigy as a youngster, joining top-flight Tbilisi Lokomotiv at the age of 15 and scoring 22 goals in two seasons from the wing. In 2015, aged 17, he moved to Shakhtar Donetsk under Romanian manager Mircea Lucescu and the future looked bright - but when Lucescu left a year later, the new coach, Paulo Fonseca, left him out of the first-team set-up. Despite impressing in the Uefa Youth League, earning the Messi tag, his career has not gone smoothly since: an unsuccessful move to Nacional in Portugal followed by loans in Turkey and Russia, then a return to his homeland, first on loan at Samtredia, then a permanent move in 2022 to Torpedo Kutaisi. He has done well there, though, and Kutaisi's manager, the former Blackburn coach Steve Keane, still tips him for big things. ""If I ever go to a Premier League team, the first thing I'll do is take Arabidze with me.""

Son of the well-known Georgia player Vasil, Shengelia says he always felt destined to become a professional. His dad did everything to make it happen, moving his son from Kutaisi to train in Tbilisi, and spending every spare minute putting him through his paces. Results were rapid: Shengelia soon became an outstanding performer on Dinamo Tbilisi's left-wing, and, after two free-scoring years, he chose to continue his career abroad, first in Turkey, then Belgium, and now with Panetolikos in Greece. He made a huge contribution to Georgia qualifying for this summer's tournament only to suffer a serious-looking leg injury in the decisive playoff match against Greece. Via some intense rehabilitation, he proved himself fit enough to make the cut.

Tsitaishvili's father Klimenti was the youngest player in the history of the Georgian championships - making his top-flight debut at just 14. Giorgi was born in 2000 in Israel, where his father played, but he grew up in Kyiv and went on to play on the wing for Ukraine at every youth level - including scoring the winner against South Korea in the last minute of the 2019 Under-20 World Cup final. But when the time came to choose a senior national team he told the media: ""I promised my grandfather that I would only play for the national team of my ancestors' homeland - Georgia."" At club level, following the Russian invasion he moved to Poland's Wisla Krakow on loan, then to Lech Poznan, and, last year, to Georgia with Dinamo Batumi.

The most talented of three footballing brothers, Kiteishvili's senior career started on loan from Dinamo Tbilisi to his hometown club Metalurgi Rustavi, where life as a pro wasn't quite how he imagined it would be: the club had no money for salaries, and a training ground with no electricity or running water. But he rose above it. Impressive displays there earned him a shot at Dinamo's first team when he returned, and he took it, growing into the side's most impressive talent and captain, and twice winning Georgia's young player of the year, in 2015 and 2016. He moved to Austria with Sturm Graz in 2018, becoming one of several players branded ""the Georgian Messi"" by the press. An experienced creative talent.

A talented teenager who could make an impact this summer. Sigua played at all youth levels for Georgia, was named the nation's top young prospect in 2021, and made his senior Dinamo Tbilisi debut in 2022 aged 17. His displays earned him a five-year deal at Swiss club Basel last year. Injuries and changes of manager have hampered his progress there, but the future still looks bright. He made his international senior debut in March last year in a 6-1 win over Mongolia, and the Georgia manager, Willy Sagnol, made a flattering comparison. ""He's similar to Leon Goretzka in his style: very busy on the field, hardworking and excellent for his age. He will show what he can do.""

27-year-old Altunashvili is a solid, sharp-shooting pick for the squad, having twice been named the best midfielder in the Georgian top-flight. The fact that he has so far only won a handful of caps is mainly down to the quality of competition in midfield. He made his first move to a foreign club last year when he joined Austria's Wolfsberger, and spoke recently about how it felt to qualify with Georgia for this summer's tournament. ""It's actually hard to put into words how much this means to us as players but also as citizens. Georgians are crazy about football."" One thing he is particularly looking forward to in the group stage: ""It will of course be extremely exciting if Ronaldo actually plays against us. But I have to admit, my absolute favourite is Messi.""

Gagnidze has had a dizzying rise: moving up from Dinamo Tbilisi's academy into the first-team at 17, being named Georgia's best young player, and earning a move to Russian giants Dynamo Moscow at the end of season - having also represented his country at every age group. His potential still seems huge. In 2022 he joined Poland's Rakow Czestochowa on loan. Asked by a journalist whether he preferred eating Polish borscht or Russian buckwheat, Gagnidze replied: ""I have issues around buckwheat. As a child I dropped a pot of buckwheat and got a burn on my arm. So I don't like it anymore. You could say that I have a conflict with buckwheat.""

Kochorashvili played only two matches - 44 minutes on the field in total - in the Georgian top-flight with Saburtalo before leaving the country. He first moved on loan to Spanish club Girona, then made a permanent switch to Levante in 2019. Via a loan spell with Castellón he has since established himself as a solid ball-winner and creative influence - and he stood out in the playoffs for Georgia before this summer's tournament. He scored from the spot in the shootout against Greece in the final - and when Georgia won, he was the only player who stood still in the centre of the field, wide-eyed, not quite believing what had just happened.

Chakvetadze was born in Tbilisi into a family of refugees from Abkhazia, and took his first steps in football with Norchi Dinamoeli before entering Dynamo's academy. His talent was obvious and, after a fine display at the 2017 Under-19 Euros, he was a target for a host of top clubs. He moved first to Gent in Belgium, then to Watford, initially on loan, in 2023. At Gent he was given the number 7 shirt, his favourite number because of his hero, Cristiano Ronaldo. There is a photo of Chakvetadze as a boy staring wide-eyed at Ronaldo at the opening of the Dynamo academy in 2013; 11 years later he is set to come face to face with him again, this time on the pitch.

Spurred on by his grandfather's passion, Mekvabishvili's all-energy displays as a boy were spotted in a youth tournament by a Dinamo Tbilisi coach, who invited him to try out at the club. That coach was Suliko Davitashvili, father of Zuriko, who now lines up in the same Georgia squad this summer as Mekvabishvili. In his early days at the academy Mekvabishvili was played at right-back, then tried at centre-back, before being moved up into defensive midfield, where he excelled. He made his way into Dinamo's first team in that position, then moved to Romania with Universitatea Craiova earlier this year. Away from football he is a huge basketball fan.

An outstanding veteran, the nation's second-most capped player, and twice Georgian player of the year. He made his name in Ukraine in eight years with Dnipro, becoming their captain - with his last appearance before a €1.5m move to French club Reims being in their dramatic 3-2 Europa League final defeat to Sevilla in 2015. He was also remembered at Dnipro for helping save Dynamo Kyiv captain Oleg Gusev who swallowed his tongue during a collision; Kankava cleared Gusev's airway, ending up with bleeding fingers after being accidentally bitten. On 21 March this year, after a three-year absence from the national team, Kankava made an emotional return against Luxembourg, and was handed the captain's armband by Guram Kashia.

Nikoloz ""Nika"" Kvekveskiri was born in the Gali district of Abkhazia in Georgia's north. When he was a year-and-a-half old Russia occupied the territory, so his family fled to a refugee settlement in Zugdidi. He grew up there in tough conditions, but, aged five, developed a stubborn determination to play football, always seen dragging a huge bag with him to training. He remembers those who helped him along the way - including once when a bus driver refused to take him home because he was too muddy, and a driver of another bus told him: ""Hey kid, put something down to cover the seat and sit in my bus, I'm leaving soon."" In the years since he has built a title-winning career in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and now Poland, and has amassed more than 50 senior Georgia appearances, but no goals. Apart from, of course, one important one: the final, winning penalty in the playoff shootout final with Greece.

When the young attacking midfielder made his debut on loan at Telavi from Dinamo Tbilisi, Moistsrapishvili quickly caught the eye - and his progress in Dinamo's first-team when he returned earned links with several big clubs. A loan spell to Beveren in Belgium last year proved a let-down, though: he played just nine times before the move was terminated in March this year. He has shown enough raw talent, though, to earn himself a spot in this summer's squad, and could be one to keep an eye on if he's given a chance. He has played at Under-19 and Under-21 level, and performed well in the 2023 Under-21 Euros.

Only 23, Davitashvili has already played for eight clubs - starting in Georgia with Dinamo Tbilisi before finding his way to France, via Russia. Always highly-rated, he appeared on several lists of emerging prodigies as a youngster, but has struggled to settle down so far. However his four-year deal at Bordeaux, and his solid form to date, suggests that may have changed. His father Suliko played for clubs including Meranil Tbilisi, where one of his teammates was Badri Kvaratskhelia - whose son Khvicha joins Suliko's boy in this summer's squad. Suliko was known as ""Abreza"", meaning ""short gun"", in honour of his lack of height (5ft 4in) and his lethal finishing.

""Kvaradona"" comes from a big footballing family - not just players but also two Fifa referees and one Uefa Media Officer (the author of these profiles). His grandfather Mamiya was a star for Skuri Tsalenjikha and the master of bicycle kicks; his dad Badri was a multiple title-winner in Georgia and Azerbaijan; and Khvicha himself won Serie A's best player in 2022-23, and Georgia's sportsman of the year for 2024. And none of that could have happened but for his mum Maka taking him training in all weathers while Badri was coaching abroad. Khvicha's little brother, 14-year-old Tornike, is also tipped for success. Kvaratskheliais inspirational too: before the playoff victory he gathered the younger players in the dressing room and told them: ""Boys, we are young, but there are some veterans in our team ... For them this chance is the last one to play in a major tournament ... Let's play for them, let's play for our country and win this match!"" And some key trivia: Kvaratskhelia is one of the country's biggest family names, dating back to when Georgia's best cows were the cows of Kvaratskhelia. After occupation by the USSR in 1921, though, private farms were abolished, and the famous cows disappeared.

Zivzivadze started out at Dinamo Tbilisi, spending four years there mainly stuck in the reserves, despite scoring 47 goals in 50 matches one season, and 23 goals in 21 the next. It took him loan spells in Georgia and Denmark to earn a first-team chance at Dinamo, returning there on loan from Esbjerg, where he scored 28 in all competitions. But the move did not become permanent: he set off again via Torpedo Kutaisi and three clubs in Hungary to end up in Germany's second-tier with Karlsruher. His form there, and scoring instinct, make him a favourite for Willy Sagnol - and two goals in the playoff semi-final win over Luxembourg showed why.

When Georgia's FA, and a vocal media campaign, finally convinced the France-born Mikautadze to choose them as his national side in 2021, his mother wrote an open letter. ""Thank you very much for your support. This is very important for Giorgi and he is proud of the fact that you and your colleagues, relatives, friends and the whole of Georgia are with him."" Giorgi himself said: ""Willy Sagnol called me and we talked. He told me that he has been watching me for some time and likes my game, it made me happy. The whole family is with me. I've dreamed of defending the honour of my country's national team since I was a boy."" He joined Ajax from Metz for a reported €16m last year, but failed to make a real impact. He has recovered his form back on loan at Metz, though. So much so that a string of top clubs have been linked.

As a boy at the Dana Cup, one of the world's biggest youth tournaments, Kvilitaia scored a goal in every game, but Danish scouts didn't think he had enough about him to offer further trials. Instead he continued developing back in Georgia's second-tier with the now-defunct Sasco Tbilisi. At 19 he became the first second-tier player recruited by a foreign club when he moved to Hungary with Gyor. In 2015 he joined Georgia's top club, Dinamo Tbilisi, scoring a goal a game in a prolific season, before moving to Rapid in Austria, Gent in Belgium and Anorthosis in Cyprus. He joined current club Apoel in 2021, becoming captain and producing consistent displays. Now, aged 30, he brings a wealth of experience to this summer's squad.",turkish-football.com,news,Turkish Football,Emre Sarigul,0.3176470588235294,454064941,4,,

Headed by power industry specialist Brendon Scott, Vestwoods South Africa brings to the market advanced technology, local commissioning, and support, with warranties and a swap-out policy for greater peace of mind.

Scott says Vestwoods first arrived in the South African market in 2018, with telecommunications companies among the first to welcome the brand. ""Vestwoods' market share has grown in a short period of time to over 10%,"" he says.

Vestwoods South Africa opened its first office in Centurion last year. Scott believes the brand is well positioned to meet growing demand in South Africa. ""Vestwoods is a trusted global brand seeing growth in over 30 countries, including India, Japan, Korea, the US, Germany, and Hungary, as well as 10 African countries. The company will soon also be operational in Australia,"" he says.

""The quality and technical capabilities of the product are superior. As an R&D focused company, Vestwoods is continuously improving and enhancing its products. Importantly, the Vestwoods proprietary battery management system (BMS) is a particularly advanced and robust system built to optimise the performance of the batteries and reduce the risk of failure.""

He notes that a significant cause of battery failures is due to the BMS. ""Thanks to the quality of our BMS and battery technology, we have an extremely low failure return rate of under 0.2%.

Vestwoods South Africa offers four product streams - residential inverters and batteries; a 12V series for smaller backup applications such as camping and marine; a UPS series; and a high voltage range of commercial and industrial size batteries.

Scott expects significant uptake in the commercial and industrial sectors, as more businesses move to optimise renewable energy for backup and to reduce their electricity costs. ""In Gauteng, we get around 300 days of sunshine a year, so it makes sense to use solar where possible,"" he says.

""Initially, many installers offered businesses and industries multiple residential low voltage batteries for backup and solar power, but as these businesses make solar a permanent fixture, they are looking to move to high voltage batteries that are built for commercial and industrial use.""

""The price gap between high voltage batteries and the equivalent capacity in multiple low voltage batteries is closing, so organisations are now moving to appropriate battery technology.""

Vestwoods is seeing interest in these batteries from manufacturers, office buildings, schools, game farms and agriculture.

""With our quality and well-designed technology backed by continuous research and development, customers get a safer, longer lasting product that will operate more efficiently. We have local availability, with local warehousing, which means no lengthy waits for stock.""

""The batteries are installed by approved partners around the country, and our local engineering team does the commissioning of the system once it's installed, all included in the price. Local commissioning includes skills transfer and training to ensure installers are equipped to install and maintain Vestwoods products.""

""Local support gives our customers a great deal of peace of mind: we honour warranties locally and have a local repair centre. Our swap-out policy is also very important for customers, as they know they won't be at risk of significant downtime in the event of battery problems,"" he says.

Scott says customers typically enjoy solid savings by moving from grid only or generator power to a solar hybrid system, coupled with the appropriate batteries for the application.

""We can calculate to illustrate to the end customers how much they can save, depending on the variables of the project,"" he says. ""There's always a saving in the long term, especially when you consider the avoidable losses of not being able to operate due to a power outage.""",mybroadband.co.za,news,MyBroadband,,0.4666666666666666,454049793,1,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Vestwoods-Headline-image-1200x800-1.jpg,

The visit from Ms. Baerbock, who urged the West to supply Ukraine with more air defences, came after more than two dozen Russian drones targeted Ukraine overnight, in an attack that left several wounded in the eastern Kharkiv region.

""The situation in Ukraine has once more dramatically deteriorated with the massive Russian aerial attacks on civilian infrastructure and the brutal Russian offensive in the Kharkiv region,"" Ms. Baerbock said when she arrived for her eighth visit to the country since Russia invaded in February 2022.

Russia-Ukraine Crisis: Why is Kharkiv important? | Explained

To protect itself from the ""rain of Russian drones and missiles"", Ukraine ""urgently needs a boosted air defence"", she said.

""Our support is based on the deep conviction that Ukraine will win this war,"" Ms. Baerbock said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned last week that the Russian ground offensive launched this month in the Kharkiv region may only be a ""first wave"" and that Russian troops could be aiming for the city of Kharkiv -- the second largest in Ukraine.

The Russian official appointed by Moscow as governor of the Kharkiv region said on Tuesday that his country's forces were now in control of nearly half of Vovchansk.

The town near the Russian border that had around 17,000 residents before the war and is now the epicentre of fighting.

Drone barrage

""Our guys control about 40 percent of the city. They have cut deep into the defence and knocked out the enemy as far as they could,"" said the official, Vitaly Ganchev.

""The northern part of the city has already been completely liberated,"" he told Russian state television.

A Ukrainian military spokesman meanwhile told state media that fighting in the Kharkiv region ""remains difficult and is changing dynamically"".

But he also said the number of bouts with Russian forces had decreased.

In a rebuke to Ms. Baerbock, the Kremlin said that even if supplies of Western weapons to Ukraine picked up, more deliveries would not change Russia's dominant position on the front.

""It will still not allow the Ukrainian armed forces to somehow change the dynamics on the fronts,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Mr. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to provide at least seven more air defence systems, including at least two to protect the Kharkiv region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine and its allies will at some point run out of steam, Ms. Baerbock said.

""(But) we have the capacity to hold out,"" she said.

Just before Ms. Baerbock arrived, the Ukrainian air force said it had intercepted 28 out of 29 Iranian-designed attack drones launched by Russian forces overnight.

The unmanned aerial vehicles were downed over southern and eastern regions of Ukraine.

The head of the Kharkiv region said a 53-year-old man was wounded by Russian rocket fire that targeted a transport infrastructure facility.

Systematic Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid have crippled the sector and officials in the capital announced rolling power cuts throughout the day on Tuesday to reduce the load on the network.

The national grid operator said Ukraine was importing electricity from Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to make up a shortfall due to Russian strikes.

To conserve energy, the government has ordered nationwide rolling blackouts for Monday night, broadening the smaller regional ones that have become the norm in recent weeks.

""This is another front line in the war,"" said Maxim Timchenko, the head of DTEK, Ukraine's largest private electricity company, on social media last week. He said the company's workers were engaged in a ""race against time"" to restore power to consumers.

The nationwide blackout, scheduled from 6 p.m. to midnight, will affect the entire country for the first time this year, but it is unclear if it will continue past Monday.

The winter of 2022-23 was especially hard on Ukrainians after Russian forces struck many power plants, leaving much of the population without heat in the bitter cold. But after that, Ukrainian forces became more adept at shooting down incoming missiles and had more weapons at their disposal to do so. At least until this spring.

As Ukrainian troops run low on weaponry, especially after the United States slowed down deliveries of arms, they have been less able to protect themselves against Russian barrages that have also become more sophisticated.

Stepped-up attacks by Russia are raising fears that power cuts will not only affect consumers but that they will also hurt Ukraine's defense industry when it is most needed.

""It definitely slows down the production, and it becomes more expensive,"" said Oleksandr Dmitriyev, who coordinates efforts to supply the military with weapons and other equipment. ""It is easier for civilians to survive without electricity, but for military production during the war it is critically important to have it.""

Besides imposing blackouts, Ukraine is asking for assistance from its Western partners, requesting power grid equipment and emergency electricity imports. On Sunday, Ukraine imported power from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova.

DTEK has also started a campaign asking countries to give Ukraine used equipment that they no longer need.

""To buy or order the production of new equipment quickly is impossible,"" said Pavlo Bilodid, a spokesperson for the company. ""The only way is to get used equipment from countries that don't need it anymore, and only their political will is needed for that.""

The electricity equipment that is possible to use in Ukraine is in the post-Soviet countries of Eastern Europe. Many of them have already started working on donating it.

Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk, who became the undisputed world heavyweight champion Sunday, also joined the campaign and recorded a video wearing a T-shirt with the words ""the fight for light.""

""These attacks are directed against people,"" Usyk said in the video.

Ukraine is also requesting more air defense systems, especially the U.S.-made Patriot system, both to protect its electricity grid and to help it resist the Russian offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region that started 10 days ago. Deep State, a group that analyzes combat footage and has close links to the Ukrainian army, said Sunday that Russian forces had advanced in 10 different locations in Ukraine's east and south, but had not captured any new villages.

""Two Patriots for the Kharkiv region could significantly help in protecting lives from Russian terror,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week during his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Zelenskyy has also urged Ukrainians and businesses to consume electricity responsibly. ""We need to ensure that the public is fully informed about how power cuts happen now, when there is a peak load, and why we need everyone to be conscious of their consumption,"" he said in a video address Friday night.

One consumer, a tailor named Oleksandr, said he worried about the effect the rolling blackouts would have on his business. Other business owners have expressed similar worries.

""When the power cut is at home, my family has prepared for it,"" said Oleksandr, who would provide only his first name. ""My biggest fear is no power at work, which I will not be able to do without the electricity.""",seattletimes.com,news,The Seattle Times,Constant Meheut,-0.2156862745098039,454007075,23,https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05202024_TZR_UKRAINE_RUSSIA_FIGHTING-NYT_tzr_125304.jpg?d=1020x655,eng-9595977

Governments have given the final rubber stamp to new rules on the functioning on the EU's internal market for electricity, which aim to limit the dramatic price surges and windfall profits seen during the 2022 energy crisis.

The pricing model used for spot sales of electricity meant power prices tracked the soaring cost of gas in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to high prices for end users and huge profits for electricity firms, especially for renewable wind, solar or hydro power where marginal costs are close to zero.

Under a revised market regulation, the essential model remains in place, but the European Commission is empowered to declare European or regional prices crises, allowing governments to temporarily cap prices for SMEs, energy intensive industries and vulnerable consumers.

Such interventions are permitted when wholesale prices rise to two and a half times the average for the previous five years, at least €180/MWh, and are forecast to remain high for six months or more. Commission data showed average retail prices roughly doubled towards the end of 2022, on the back of average wholesale prices surging beyond €400/MWh, as much as ten times those seen in previous years.

The legislation also allows for the use of two-way contracts for difference to incentivise investment in renewables and nuclear power. While such schemes have previously guaranteed a minimum wholesale price for generators through national subsidies, the two-way model also imposes a cap with revenue in excess of the maximum to be repaid to the state.

A separate EU directive focuses on consumer protection, guaranteeing free choice of supplier and a choice between fixed-term, fixed price agreements or dynamic contracts where end-user prices track the wholesale market price. Governments should also ensure that vulnerable or low-income households are protected from market turbulence, for instance by banning disconnection or implementing support schemes.

The new rules were endorsed unanimously by EU governments except for Budapest, which said in a statement ahead of the vote that declaring an energy crisis should be a national prerogative, and that the legislation ""fails to provide Hungary sufficient flexibility to ensure affordable prices and to apply a below-cost price regulation to protect household consumers"".

The EU executive welcomed the new regulatory regime, which should be fully in place within six months. ""Under this updated framework, European households and businesses will benefit from more security, affordability and transparency on the European energy markets,"" European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič said.

Electricity companies, represented by the Brussels-based trade group Eurelectric, were also broadly positive about the new market rules, with secretary-general Kristian Ruby welcoming the continuation of a ""truly universal European internal market"".

""Through maintaining short-term wholesale markets based on marginal pricing, we preserved also an efficient functioning power system,"" Ruby said in an email exchange with Euronews, welcoming a focus on ""improving long-term hedging and contracting opportunities"" on the energy markets.

""We now have the right market design in place to do the massive build out needed to reach our climate neutral objectives,"" Ruby said. ""The key challenge we foresee is securing the necessary financing to make the transition happen.""",euronews.com,news,Euronews English,,0.1215686274509804,454006400,13,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/15/83/54/1200x675_cmsv2_cc98da7d-1a2d-5d5d-a021-149496f7a4ba-6158354.jpg,

Member states rubber-stamped the creation of a new single hydrogen operator today (May 21) aiming to boost the mix of renewable and low-carbon gases within the EU's energy infrastructure system.

In December 2021 the European Commission proposed a so-called 'Gas Package' to lay down common internal rules for renewable, low-carbon gases, natural gas and hydrogen, culminating with the creation of the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen.

The proposal was originally contested by Czechia, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria and others, during negotiations between the European Parliament, the Commission and the EU Council. After intense discussions, today's vote was almost unanimous in favour, apart from Hungary's opposition.

The new rules call for ""integrated and transparent network planning across the EU"" with the future hydrogen market falling under the oversight of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). As happens with existing gas network operators, the upcoming hydrogen network operator will be guided by a 10-year EU network development plan provided by the different national hydrogen operators across the bloc, according to the final text.

EU countries have two years to accommodate the new hydrogen rules into their national legislation and they'll need to come up with tariff discounts and incentives to ease their market and system integration, especially for the emerging hydrogen market, according to the agreed text.

France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland are the markets with the largest hydrogen production capacity, according to the data platform European Hydrogen Observatory, yet their estimated volume refers to hydrogen produced from natural gas, which clashes with the EU's ambition to reach 10m tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production by 2030.

The Observatory has also estimated that total hydrogen demand in 2022 was at 8.2m tonnes, with the biggest share coming from refineries (4.6m tonnes) and the ammonia industry (2m tonnes).

Daniel Fraile, chief policy and market officer at the Brussels-based Hydrogen Europe industry group, said the new law will provide ""much needed regulatory certainty"" as hydrogen players will know ""how and when essential infrastructure will be available"".

""The creation of a single hydrogen operator is a major stepping stone for us. It will help orchestrate infrastructure development and put us on an equal footing with electricity and gas operators when it comes to infrastructure planning,"" Fraile told Euronews.

French lawmaker Marie Toussaint (Greens), overseeing the legislative file in Parliament, regretted that the final text adopted today ""failed to make the necessary transition away from our dependence on gas"", since it lacked a date proposing to phase out fossil fuels.

""It [the text] also gives the green light to the potentially excessive development of hydrogen, without restricting it to 100% renewable criteria,"" Toussaint told Euronews.

Despite critising the extent to which the new law will contribute to decarbonise gas and hydrogen infrastructure systems, Toussaint welcomed the governance around the new hydrogen entity.

""The text allows for the creation of an independent structure dedicated to hydrogen planning, thus avoiding the pitfall pushed by the gas lobby, which would have entrusted the keys to hydrogen's future to fossil fuel actors,"" she said, adding that the negotiations helped limit the damage caused by ""potential conflicts of interest between fossil fuels and hydrogen"".",euronews.com,news,Euronews English,,0.3019607843137255,454002124,1,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/45/02/10/1200x675_cmsv2_be024fa0-3965-5218-afca-773ea9d1e375-8450210.jpg,eng-9583221

According to a ministry statement, Péter Szijjártó met Japan's ministers of economy, infrastructure and foreign affairs, before announcing that the two countries have signed a cooperation agreement on nuclear energy based on their shared intention to increase the role of nuclear energy and expand their nuclear capacities.

Szijjártó said nuclear energy was ""the safest, cheapest, most reliable and most eco-friendly method of producing electricity in large quantity, ... which would be critical to economic growth in the coming period"".

He said Hungary and Japan's agreement on cooperating on extending the lifespans of their nuclear plants' blocks was an important step forward, adding that preparations for this were already under way in the case of the reactors that operate at Hungary's Paks plant.

Szijjártó said this was also vital for preserving competitiveness as well as keeping household energy prices low in Hungary.

The two countries will also cooperate on the technological development of small modular reactors, he said, adding that this could bring about ""revolutionary change"" in ""the world's energy industry"".

He said if the technologies used to build and connect such small nuclear reactors to the network could be made permanent, Hungary would have a vested interest in their application.

Meanwhile, he said that Hungary and Japan also signed a cooperation agreement on water management aimed at enabling the sector's advanced Hungarian players to enter the Japanese market and allowing Hungary to benefit from Japan's experience in the field.

""Eco-friendly water management that facilitates the effective operation of the economy and specifically agriculture is a fundamental goal for both Japan and Hungary,"" Szijjártó said. ""And the technologies that are crucial to this field will be a key part of our cooperation.""

Concerning his talks with the executives of Japanese businesses investing in Hungary, Szijjártó welcomed that Hungarian exports to Japan reached a record one billion US dollars last year, and that Japanese companies kept investing in Hungary.

Japanese companies form the tenth largest investor community in Hungary, employing around 50,000 people, he said, adding that at his talks, business executives expressed their intention to invest 150 million-200 million euros in the automotive, electronics and food industries.

Meanwhile, Szijjártó said Hungary has decided to open a consulate in Osaka, which will host the World Expo in 2025. Hungary will bring a pavilion to the expo that is worthy of the event and showcases the country's economic, tourism and cultural appeal, the minister said.",dailynewshungary.com,news,Daily News Hungary,,0.4901960784313726,454000068,38,,

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock voiced concern on Tuesday over the worsening battlefield conditions for Ukrainian forces on the eastern front, during an unannounced visit to Kyiv.

The visit from Baerbock, who urged the West to supply Ukraine with more air defences, came after more than two dozen Russian drones targeted Ukraine overnight, in an attack that left several wounded in the eastern Kharkiv region.

""The situation in Ukraine has once more dramatically deteriorated with the massive Russian aerial attacks on civilian infrastructure and the brutal Russian offensive in the Kharkiv region,"" Baerbock said when she arrived for her eighth visit to the country since Russia invaded in February 2022.

To protect itself from the ""rain of Russian drones and missiles"", Ukraine ""urgently needs a boosted air defence"", she said.

""Our support is based on the deep conviction that Ukraine will win this war,"" Baerbock said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned last week that the Russian ground offensive launched this month in the Kharkiv region may only be a ""first wave"" and that Russian troops could be aiming for the city of Kharkiv -- the second largest in Ukraine.

The Russian official appointed by Moscow as governor of the Kharkiv region said on Tuesday that his country's forces were now in control of nearly half of Vovchansk.

The town near the Russian border that had around 17,000 residents before the war and is now the epicentre of fighting.

- Drone barrage -

""Our guys control about 40 percent of the city. They have cut deep into the defence and knocked out the enemy as far as they could,"" said the official, Vitaly Ganchev.

""The northern part of the city has already been completely liberated,"" he told Russian state television.

A Ukrainian military spokesman meanwhile told state media that fighting in the Kharkiv region ""remains difficult and is changing dynamically"".

But he also said the number of bouts with Russian forces had decreased.

In a rebuke to Baerbock, the Kremlin said that even if supplies of Western weapons to Ukraine picked up, more deliveries would not change Russia's dominant position on the front.

""It will still not allow the Ukrainian armed forces to somehow change the dynamics on the fronts,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to provide at least seven more air defence systems, including at least two to protect the Kharkiv region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine and its allies will at some point run out of steam, Baerbock said.

""(But) we have the capacity to hold out,"" she said.

Just before Baerbock arrived, the Ukrainian air force said it had intercepted 28 out of 29 Iranian-designed attack drones launched by Russian forces overnight.

The unmanned aerial vehicles were downed over southern and eastern regions of Ukraine.

The head of the Kharkiv region said a 53-year-old man was wounded by Russian rocket fire that targeted a transport infrastructure facility.

""Our support is based on the deep conviction that Ukraine will win this war,"" Baerbock said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned last week that the Russian ground offensive launched this month in the Kharkiv region may only be a ""first wave"" and that Russian troops could be aiming for the city of Kharkiv -- the second largest in Ukraine.

The Russian official appointed by Moscow as governor of the Kharkiv region said on Tuesday that his country's forces were now in control of nearly half of Vovchansk.

The town near the Russian border that had around 17,000 residents before the war and is now the epicentre of fighting.

""Our guys control about 40 percent of the city. They have cut deep into the defence and knocked out the enemy as far as they could,"" said the official, Vitaly Ganchev.

""The northern part of the city has already been completely liberated,"" he told Russian state television.

A Ukrainian military spokesman meanwhile told state media that fighting in the Kharkiv region ""remains difficult and is changing dynamically"".

But he also said the number of bouts with Russian forces had decreased.

In a rebuke to Baerbock, the Kremlin said that even if supplies of Western weapons to Ukraine picked up, more deliveries would not change Russia's dominant position on the front.

""It will still not allow the Ukrainian armed forces to somehow change the dynamics on the fronts,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to provide at least seven more air defence systems, including at least two to protect the Kharkiv region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that Ukraine and its allies will at some point run out of steam, Baerbock said.

""(But) we have the capacity to hold out,"" she said.

Just before Baerbock arrived, the Ukrainian air force said it had intercepted 28 out of 29 Iranian-designed attack drones launched by Russian forces overnight.

The unmanned aerial vehicles were downed over southern and eastern regions of Ukraine.

The head of the Kharkiv region said a 53-year-old man was wounded by Russian rocket fire that targeted a transport infrastructure facility.

Systematic Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid have crippled the sector and officials in the capital announced rolling power cuts throughout the day on Tuesday to reduce the load on the network.

The national grid operator said Ukraine was importing electricity from Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to make up a shortfall due to Russian strikes.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock voiced concern on Tuesday over the worsening battlefield conditions for Ukrainian forces on the eastern front, during an unannounced visit to Kyiv.

It may be available only for a limited time on this website.

In part two of Lubrication from Stone Age to Modern Age (Technical Bulletin 89), we slid through 145 years of action-packed lubrication history and left off towards the end of the Gilded Age, full of hope and fuelled by endless technological possibilities. What was not to love? We had electricity, telephones, toasters, cars on the road, planes in the air and plenty of oil to lubricate the machines born of our wildest imagination.

The next leg of our journey finds us in the closing years of the late modern period. This was a time of unprecedented change and upheaval, and the events that would unfold over the coming decades would reshape the world in a profound way.

This was the quiet before the storm, the eve of the first world war and what would become the start of the bloodiest chapter in human history. Also called The Great War, World War one (WWI) would claim the lives of over 20 million people in four years and set the stage for yet another world war just 20 years later.

The sad truth is that war creates the conditions for great advances in technology, and so it was for those early years of the 20th century, where we saw significant discoveries, inventions and innovations across various fields.

Honourable mentions from this time period include the theory of special relativity, the principles of quantum mechanics, Rutherford's Nuclear Model, and the discovery of penicillin and insulin. As for inventions, there was the assembly line, television, motion pictures, the electric refrigerator, the zipper and all that jazz.

Guest appearances include Ernest Rutherford, Robert Goddard, Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Alexander Fleming, Admiral Richard Byrd and Sigmund Freud - the Austrian psychoanalyst with mommy issues.

1908 CE

Demand for crude oil continued to increase steadily as the second industrial revolution drew to a close and petroleum based lubricants became commonplace; but things were about to go into overdrive, thanks to one man with an audacious dream - Henry Ford, the man who put the world on wheels.

The development of the Model T began in 1907, when Henry Ford and his team set out to create an affordable, reliable, and efficient car that could be produced in large quantities for the general public. That dream became reality when the first Model T Ford or ""Tin Lizzie"", as it affectionately became known, rolled off the assembly line in October of 1908. The engine lubricant of choice for this contemporary engineering marvel was an additive-free SAE 30 monograde oil produced by Veedol, called ""Fordol"", which also served as transmission fluid.

Prior to the introduction of the assembly line system in 1913, the record time for building one Tin Lizzie stood at just over 12 hours. Under this new system, a car could be assembled in 1 hour and 33 minutes allowing Ford to produce 1,000 cars a day.

Mr Ford, in a controversial move, also raised the minimum daily wage for factory workers from $2.34 to $5 and reduced their working hours. The morning following the wage hike announcement 10,000 men showed up at the Ford Michigan plant eager for a job.

This altruistic gesture was not borne out of charity, but good business sense - his workers could now afford to buy the vehicles they built, which created loyalty towards Ford and sparked a rise in middle-class consumerism among workers. Happy workers, happy assembly line.

1909 CE

In 1899 Charles ""Cheers"" Wakefield, an oil man by trade, quit his job at the Vacuum Oil Company, part of the Standard Oil Company, and founded CC Wakefield & Co. in London.

As the patent holder for an automatic steam engine lubricator, Wakefield initially focused the company's efforts on the rail business, but as an entrepreneur and technophile it was the fledgling motor vehicle and aviation industries that captured his imagination, and so the company started developing lubricants especially suited to the engines in these wheeled and winged mechanical marvels of the 20th century.

In 1909, while experimenting with different oil blends, Wakefield's lubricant researchers discovered

that adding a relatively small proportion of castor oil from castor-bean seeds to their lubricants, achieved a desirable viscometric balance. This resulted in a product that was viscous enough to function effectively at high temperatures, while also remaining sufficiently fluid at cold start-ups.

In light of this breakthrough, they coined the new product ""Castrol"", to signifying the key ingredient, castor oil, in their innovative lubricant formulation. They initially produced five variants for different applications, with Castrol R being the flagship product intended for high-performance aero and racing engines. Castrol would go on to be used in non-rotary engine applications during WWI.

Soon afterward, Wakefield positioned his company with racers, sponsoring pilots, riders and drivers. Over time, the Castrol brand became synonymous with racing-world speed and endurance records.

In the late 1930s, Wakefield coined the Castrol slogan ""Fluid Engineering"", which would eventually evolve to its contemporary tagline - ""It's more than just oil. It's liquid engineering."" In 1960, with the name of their most prominent product famed the world over, the Wakefield company officially became Castrol Ltd. Cheers, Mr Wakefield!

1911 CE

The age of the automobile was truly upon us, and with development of the internal combustion engine came the demand for better lubricating oils. Recognising a need for a system of standardisation, the now well-established Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) introduced the first of many engine oil classification systems based on viscosity in 1911. The system was intended to reflect how suitable an oil was for use as an engine lubricant, and at the same time be easy for consumers to understand.

That initial specification defined five different numbered grades of engine oil based on their viscosity at 100°C - SAE 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50, with a sixth grade (SAE 60) being defined later in 1926.

1913 CE

Friedrich Bergius was a German chemist and pioneering researcher who came from a long line of scientists. In 1913, he developed a method for transforming a solid form of coal (lignite) into liquefied oil by exposing the lignite to hydrogen gas under high pressure to form hydrocarbon-based fuels and lubricating oils.

For his efforts, Friedrich was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1931, which he shared with his corecipient, Carl Bosch - the German scientist who developed the Haber-Bosch process. Friedrich is considered one of the most important German chemists of the 20th century.

1914 CE

Aircraft design came a long way in the ten years between the Wright brothers' first flight in 1903 and the outbreak of World War I (WWI) in 1914. This was a transformative time marked by significant advancements in aviation technology, pioneering flights, and the emergence of early aircraft engine manufacturers, who were experimenting with inline and rotary engines.

WWI was the first major conflict involving the large-scale use of aircraft, and introduced a 19th-century world to more modern ideas and technologies, many of which required lubricants.

The concept of ""air superiority"" was unheard of before 1914 and there was no such thing as a fighter plane, but both sides of the conflict quickly recognised the advantages of creating flying war machines, and worked relentlessly throughout the war to develop faster, bigger and deadlier fighters and bombers. Winning the war in the skies became a tactical necessity during the Great War Initially the main military role of aircraft was reconnaissance, but at the start of the war, these reconnaissance planes were such a novelty that enemy pilots would actually wave at each other as they crisscrossed the front lines. It wasn't long before the strategic importance of spy planes sunk in, and with it, a burning desire to shoot the enemy's aircraft out of the sky.

In early skirmishes, these slow-moving reconnaissance planes would take pot shots at each other with service pistols and rifles but with the breakthrough design of Anthony Fokker's ""interrupter gear"" in 1915, front-mounted machine guns could fire a continuous barrage of bullets safely through the plane's rotating propeller blades. All pilots had to do was aim the nose of the plane at the enemy and fire. This ingenious device would make its world debut in one of Fokker's creations, the E.1 Eindekker Scout.

And, so for the first time, planes took to the air with the express purpose of air-to-air combat, and the winners of most early ""dogfights"" were the pilots flying the better technology with the most robust engines.

So, let's take a look at the power behind the prop and how these engines shaped the lubricants used.

Rotary engines were the most ubiquitous aircraft motors available during the Great War. In fact, some estimates claim they powered as many as 80 percent of aircraft - mostly Allied fighters. These air-cooled engines were known for their simplicity, reliability, and lightweight design, making them popular choices for the aircraft of that era.

All rotary engines manufactured during this era trace their origin to the archetypal aeronautical rotaries - The Gnome engine. Even though developed by a French engineer and produced in France, these engines were also produced under license in many countries by other manufacturers, such as Le Rhone, Clerget, Bentley and Oberursel. They powered outstanding fighter planes, including the British Sopwith Camel and the Bristol Scout, as well as the French Nieuport.

While German aircraft manufacturers tended to prefer inline water-cooled engines, prominent aircraft manufacturers like Fokker mounted rotary engines in their winged creations like the Fokker DR.1. This was the iconic triplane that would become synonymous with Germany's most prolific fighter ace and the top ranking fighter pilot of WWI - Manfred von Richthofen, aka the Red Baron - who terrorised the skies over the western front with his Jastas 1 squadron, which was often referred to as the ""Flying Circus"" on account of the unit's brightly coloured fighter planes and agility in aerial combat.

Regardless of make, all rotaries shared a total-loss oil system, in which oil would mix with the fuel in the crankcase before entering the combustion chamber.

As the engine operated, the oil was burned along with the fuel, and some of it was expelled with the exhaust gases. This ensured that the engine was adequately lubricated during operation.

However, rotary engines were not without their issues. They were prone to high oil consumption due to oil leaks, and the total-loss oil system necessitated carrying a surplus of lubricant since these engines were known to spray over two litres of oil into the air for every hour of operation. Running out of oil mid-flight undoubtedly invited total engine failure and a fatal end to one's flight.

And the lubricant of choice for these rotating marvels of the sky? Castor oil.

During WWI, the choice of engine technology that was used to power birds of war was dictated by the availability of resources like fuel and, more relevantly, lubricants. The readily available castor oil was the mainstay for aircraft engine lubrication in England and France, where rotary engines were widely used.

The United States had no independent source of castor oil, but it did have ample supplies of petroleum, which it supplied to Britain and France and also used to produce lubricants for its water-cooled engines.

However, distillation of specifically designed crude oil products, like lubricants, was still in relative infancy, in terms of technology, scale and consistent quality.

The Luftstreitkräfte (German air force) primarily used water-cooled engines in their aircraft, which required mineralbased lubricants, but they also had fighters and reconnaissance planes with rotary engines, which could only run effectively on castor oil.

While Germany had advanced oil-refining capabilities at the outbreak of WWI, they imported most of their crude from Austria-Hungary (a dual monarchy at the time) and Romania. Things went pear-shaped when Romania joined the Allies in 1916 - Germany no longer had access to the light crude oils needed to run their war machines.

Not deterred by this change of heart, German forces recaptured the Ploiești oil fields in a counter-attack, but the Romanians had destroyed all of the above-ground stocks of petroleum, and most of the equipment, which set back the German's oil supply considerably, right at the peak of war.

They also struggled to import the much-needed castor oil for their rotary engines due to the tight naval blockade by the British Royal Navy, which made operating these engines increasingly difficult and led to the creation of a substitute - Voltol - also known as Ersatz (German for substitute) oil. This war-time home-brew was a mixture of rapeseed and mineral oil produced by electrical cracking. The less-than-satisfactory castor oil knock-off was blamed for numerous engine failures in German-built Oberursel rotary engines.

As the war progressed, rotary engines fell from favour with the Luftstreitkräfte and, by 1917, many German engine manufacturers focused their attention on producing heavier six-cylinder inline water-cooled engines that could use conventional mineral-oil-based lubricants.

Now, back to the beans of war - castor oil was the natural choice for rotary engines with a total-loss lubrication system operating in the arduous conditions of war service. This fit-for-purpose lubricant bonded to the metal surfaces, could maintain a film under high loads and had a relatively stable viscosity over a wider temperature range when compared to mineral oils. Another property that made castor oil essential, was that it is immiscible with petrol, so it delivered lubrication at the same time as the fuel combusted. If mineral oil was used in this system, it would be diluted with the fuel and lose its lubricating properties.

However, the use of castor oil was not without its challenges. It had poor oxidation stability and the propensity for forming gum deposits under high-temperature operation, but thankfully this was not a serious issue with the total loss system.

A more troublesome issue was that it would congeal in very cold temperatures, and so it became common practice to thin out the oil by syringing kerosene into the cylinder head to keep the valves and piston rings from sticking. Another partial remedy was to heat up the castor oil (to above 50 ⁰C) and mix it with a small dose of a lighter mineral oil like Vacuum A Mobiloil - a basic SAE 30. According to RAF (Royal Air Force) historical society journals of British logistics on the Western Front, Cavalry Corps general service wagons carried Vacuum A oil for this very purpose, and for use in non-rotary engines.

A lesser-known fact about the use of castor oil in aero-engines during WWI was its effect on the pilots.

Ever wondered why WWI pilots wore white silk scarves? Sure, they certainly looked dashing with their scarves snapping in the wind, but this was an act born of necessity, not pretentious styling. Apart from being a symbol of distinction between different squadrons, silk scarves also prevented neck-chafing as the pilots twisted their necks while scanning the not-so-friendly skies for enemy aircraft.

However, there was another very good reason to don this accessory - running a rotary engine on castor oil in a total-loss lubrication system was a messy business.

After combustion, castor oil fumes were expelled out the exhaust valve and vented back over the plane and the pilot, who was sitting in an open cockpit. So, scarves were essential for wiping goggles clean of castor oil and any other muck that flew at the pilot's face. Cleaning goggles with an oily scarf would only make matters worse, so the choice of colour (white) was to make it easier to spot a soiled scarf before smudging one's goggles.

Another unfortunate side-effect was that these pilots often ingested a certain amount of the oil mist during flight, which had a, uhm, purgative effect, as castor oil is a rather strong laxative. According to Canadian flying ace, Air Commodore Duncan Bell-Irving, the reported antidote to this cathartic effect was a few shots of brandy before flight. Bottoms up!

Castor oil was the oil of choice for aircraft oils at the beginning of the aviation era, but these oils would be dropped in favour of mineral-based oils in the years to come.

The rapid development of aviation in the years after the Great War saw aircraft flying faster, further and higher, with the invention of more powerful engines. As engine performance increased, along with higher temperatures and pressure, there was an urgent need for lubricating oils specifically designed to meet the needs of aircraft engines.

By the end of WWI, it was clear to all - airplanes were the weapon of the future, and so the stage was set for World War II (WWII).

1918 CE

Prior to Arthur Gulborg's invention of the grease gun in 1918, a bearing was lubricated individually using a grease-cup device. The grease-cup, aptly named, resembled a large thimble-sized reservoir sitting above the bearing entry point. The grease-cup had a screw-in lid that, when removed, allowed grease to be manually paddled in place.

Working for the Alemite Die Casting company in Chicago, Gulborg was tasked with the tedious responsibility of relubricating the diecasting machines by refilling their oil cups several times a day.

Recognising an opportunity for increased efficiency, he set out to design the first-ever pressurised grease gun that could be directly coupled to the grease fitting, making the grease-cup obsolete. He named his design the ""Alemite High Pressure Grease System."" When it was adopted in 1918 as the greasing standard for the U.S. Army, the company made a fortune.

1919 CE

The American Petroleum Institute (API) has been setting the standards for lubricant quality since its inception, but actually traces its routes to the beginning of WWI, when the American congress and the domestic natural gas and oil industry worked together to help the war effort.

After the war, momentum began to build to form a national association that could represent the entire

industry in the postwar years. So, in 1919, the API was officially formed as a standard-setting organisation, and has since become a cornerstone for establishing and maintaining worldwide standards in the oil industry.

Following WWII, the API developed the first category designations for oils. The system was rudimentary in nature and designated oils for light, medium or severe service applications.

Around 1960, engine-sequence tests were introduced to measure specific performance parameters. By 1970, the designation system changed into the API categories still seen on oil containers today, with the characteristic ""S"" and ""C"" series to denote petrol and diesel-oil performance classifications, all neatly displayed in the API service symbol, or ""Donut"", as it would come to be known.

1923 CE

In 1923, the SAE revised their viscosity-classification system. They expanded the number of viscosity grades from the original six, to ten grades, to include gear oils. The new grades ranged from SAE 10 to SAE 90, with narrower viscosity intervals between each grade.

The specification numbers ranged from 20 to 115, and were based on the first two digits of the average Saybolt viscosity seconds (SUS). This allowed for a more accurate description of an oil's viscosity characteristics, and made it easier for consumers and manufacturers to select the appropriate oil for their specific needs.

As time passed and technology evolved, the industry came to realise that the existing grade specification did not adequately describe the cold-weather performance of existing engine oils. So, in the 1950s, the original set of viscosity grades was augmented with a set of winter ""W"" grade designations, which were specified by viscosity measured at 0° F.

Over the coming years, the SAE would go on to rename its oil classification systems to its current designation of SAE J300 and J306 for engine and gear oils, convert to the metric system, and add measurements for cold cranking, pumpability and High Temperature High Shear (HTHS) viscosity, bringing us to the present-day system.

1923 CE

Oil filters were not a standard feature in earlier car engines, but that was about to change, thanks to two gentlemen - Ernest Sweetland and George Greenhalgh - who, in 1923 patented the first automotive oil filtration system. They called their device ""Purolator"", short for ""pure oil later"".

The original Purolator featured an upright series of seven twill weave, cloth-covered, perforated plates encased in a heavy duty cast canister. It also had a sight-feed glass on one side, enabling the owner to see the oil flow and change the whole unit when the flow slowed to a trickle. Purolator would go on to patent the first pleated paper oil-filter element in 1946.

1925 CE

12 years after Friedrich Bergius produced synthetic oil from coal dust, two of his countrymen - Professor Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch - applied for a patent on a process to produce liquid hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide gas and hydrogen using metal catalysts. The hydrocarbons synthesised in this process were primarily composed of liquid alkanes (paraffins), but this process also produced other by-products like olefins, alcohols, and paraffin waxes.

Franz received several awards for his scientific contributions, including the prestigious Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1930.

Hans, unfortunately, did not receive any awards for his part in this collaboration, but could take solace in the fact that the process he helped to create would bear his name.

The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis remains a critical process in the production of synthetic fuels and chemicals today, especially in a climate of environmental sustainability, where industries are increasingly focused on reducing their dependence on fossil fuels.

1927 CE

By 1927 there were more than 27 million cars on the road worldwide, of which more than 15 million were Model T Fords. Petrol had replaced kerosene as the primary focus of the petroleum industry and, as the bustling automotive industry grew, so did the emphasis on developing improved lubricating oils to meet the needs of these vehicles.

The oil industry was quick to respond to the demand for higher-quality engine oils and over the next decade, numerous refining processes, like solvent extraction and vacuum distillation of crude oil, emerged as methods for improving lubricant performance.",engineeringnews.co.za,news,Engineering News,Dimpho Madiba,-0.1372549019607843,453978131,1,https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/template/en2016/images/en_default_large.jpg,

The three major crises faced by the world over the last five years all had a negative impact on energy markets, putting countries without a coastline or an abundance of gas or oil fields in an especially difficult situation, Szijjártó said at the Global Energy Security Talks conference, according to a ministry statement.

In his address, Szijjártó warned of mounting ideological and political pressure on energy markets, saying the recent period had demonstrated the importance of carrying out a responsible energy policy. He said this involved the government ensuring a country's uninterrupted energy supply while also taking into consideration environmental protection aspects.

Szijjártó said this was only possible ""if we get rid of the ideological approach and . if we get rid of hypocrisy"". Hungary, he added, stood by its position that energy supply was not a matter of ideology or politics, but one of physics and mathematics.

He noted that the sanctions imposed in response to the war in Ukraine had resulted in an energy crisis, while western Europeans ""are proud of themselves that they got rid of Russian energy sources"". He added, however, that in reality, they were instead importing oil through third countries like India, and Russia also had the biggest share of western European LNG imports.

The minister also discussed the problem of pressure to diversify energy sources when the European Union did not want to contribute to infrastructure developments and spoke out against discrimination against nuclear energy.

Szijjártó said the Hungarian government rejected all forms of political pressure on where it chooses to buy its energy from and would always choose the best solution according to national interests.

He said decisions concerning the energy mix must remain within the EU's national competence, and they should also consider a member state's circumstances.

Hungary, he said, viewed the green transition as a means to preserving the planet rather as a political ideology or a monopoly. He added that Hungary was one of 21 countries that had managed to increase its GDP while reducing its harmful emissions.

Szijjártó underlined the need to find a balance between boosting competitiveness and environmental protection.

He highlighted three prerequisites for a responsible, carbon-neutral global energy policy of the future. The first, he said, was to ensure the role of nuclear energy, arguing that industrial growth would double the demand for electricity by the end of the decade, and nuclear reactors were the cheapest, safest and most sustainable energy sources for satisfying it.

He noted that the ongoing upgrade of Hungary's Paks nuclear power plant involved a Russian general contractor in addition to American, German and French companies, adding that this could offer hope for a return to peaceful international cooperation.

Szijjártó said the second requirement was the transport sector's transition to electric vehicles, on which a political decision has already been made in Europe. He added that this was also impossible without global cooperation, highlighting Hungary as a key meeting point for the sector's Eastern and Western players.

Thirdly, Szijjártó underlined the need infrastructure developments related to energy supply, saying there was ""no unnecessary infrastructure"".

He said the Hungarian government understood ""diversification"" of its energy supply to mean tapping new sources rather than replacing existing ones. He said this process was under way despite the EU not financing infrastructure developments in southeast Europe, arguing that gas would no longer be part of the energy mix in 15 years' time.

""They might be right . but there are 14 winters to go, for which we have to ensure the safe supply of energy,"" he said, adding that it was important to ""avoid any kind of aggressive, artificially quick phase-out of gas from the national energy mixes"".",dailynewshungary.com,news,Daily News Hungary,,0.09019607843137245,453977314,16,https://contentf5.dailynewshungary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/szijjarto.jpg,

The Hungarian government rejects any political pressure on the sources from which it should purchase energy, and will always choose the best solutions in the national interest, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said in Tokyo on Tuesday.

The minister pointed out at the Global Energy Security Forum that in the last five years there have been three major crises in a row. All of them have had a very negative impact on energy markets, putting states like Hungary, with no coastline or significant oil and gas fields, in a particularly difficult situation.

meaning that the government must ensure the country's uninterrupted energy supply while taking environmental concerns into account.

Minister Szijjártó recalled that sanctions imposed in response to the war in Ukraine have caused an energy crisis, while Western Europeans proudly claim that they are now free of Russian sources. However, this is not true, as they only buy oil with the intervention of third countries such as India, and the Russian share is the highest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.

The politician emphasized that

In this context, he also said that the composition of the national energy mix should remain a national competence in the EU, taking into account individual circumstances.

Péter Szijjártó stressed that Hungary does not see the green cause as a political ideology, but as a means to preserve the planet. He added that Hungary is one of the twenty-one countries in the world that have been able to reduce their emissions while increasing their gross domestic product (GDP). He noted that strengthening competitiveness and protecting the environment must go hand in hand and a good balance must be achieved in this respect.

The minister highlighted that a responsible, carbon-neutral global energy policy for the future requires three important preconditions to be met.

Firstly, the role of nuclear energy must be secured, as the demand for electricity will double by the end of the decade as industrial output expands, and nuclear reactors are the only way to generate sufficient quantities of electricity cheaply, safely and sustainably. He pointed out that the Paks nuclear power plant expansion project is currently carried out by American, German and French companies, in addition to the Russian prime contractor (Rosatom), which may offer hope for the return of peaceful international cooperation.

Secondly, the electrification of the transport sector, that has been politically decided in Europe, must be implemented. This is also not possible without global cooperation. Hungary is a good example in this regard, he said, as it has become an important meeting point between eastern and western players in the sector. The three largest German car manufacturers and the three largest Chinese producers of electric batteries will soon be present in Hungary and will cooperate as closely as possible.

Thirdly, he touched on the need to develop energy transport infrastructure. He underlined that the Hungarian government does not see diversification as the replacement of an energy source, but as the inclusion of new ones. This process is going ahead with great vigor, even though the EU does not support the development of infrastructure in South-East Europe, the minister noted, arguing that in 15 years' time natural gas will no longer be part of the energy mix.",hungarytoday.hu,news,Hungary Today,,0.1529411764705881,453973181,20,https://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/438168662_903931044866614_8933591800241177686_n-1024x682.jpg,

May 20 (Interfax) - Electricity shortage in the Ukrainian energy system has somewhat lessened owing to warmer and sunnier weather, although it is still considerable during evening and night hours, and therefore, hour-by-hour outage schedules could possibly be applied both to businesses and households in all parts of Ukraine from 6:00 p.m. to midnight, Ukrainian media have reported with reference to the national power grid operator Ukrenergo's post on its social account.

Outage schedules can be applied if customers exceed consumption limits, which Ukrenergo's dispatch center has set for each regional energy operator, it said.

It again urged customers to use electricity economically at any time.

The Energy Ministry said on its social account that Ukraine received emergency power supplies from Romania, Slovakia, and Poland early on Monday.

Ukrenergo said Ukraine had previously received emergency power supplies from Romania, Poland, and Slovakia from 0:01 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and from 7:00 p.m. to 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. In addition, the Ukrainian energy system absorbed surplus electricity from Poland at a request from its power grid operator from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.

Ukraine also increased commercial electricity imports by 50% to 19,499 MWh on Monday compared to Sunday. The country will be importing electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova.

About 90% of Ukraine's power generation capacity has been taken out by Russian missile attacks, according to former minister of infrastructure Aleksey Kucherenko.

The situation is not expected to improve dramatically, as the damaged infrastructure cannot be restored quickly, the member of parliament warned during an interview with the YouTube channel Vishka.

""We have lost around eight thousand megawatts of electricity, that's a lot, out of eight thousand, 800 are currently working,"" he said, citing power engineers, and warning of extensive power outages through the summer and winter.

Moscow began targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the autumn of 2022, after Russia's Crimean Bridge was bombed that October.

In recent months Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukrainian military and energy facilities. In April, the Russian Defense Ministry said the bombardment was in response to Kiev's attempts to target Russian oil infrastructure. Since January, Ukraine has launched multiple long-range attacks on energy facilities deep inside Russia, including oil depots and refineries, using kamikaze drones.

In April, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia's strikes on energy facilities ""directly affect the defense industry of Ukraine,"" calling them part of ""demilitarization"" efforts. Moscow reiterated the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations, and never at the civilian population.

To alleviate the pressure on the power grid, Ukraine has introduced temporary blackouts for industrial and household consumers in all regions. The nation has also ramped up imports of electricity from neighboring EU countries - Romania, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary - and also from Moldova.

Earlier this month, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko claimed that the combined financial losses from Russian attacks amounted to more than $1 billion, and warned that the figure is likely to rise. He noted that the main damage was to thermal and hydro generation, as well as power transmission systems.

In April, Galushchenko urged Ukrainians to prepare for outages during spring and summer, and advised the population to stock up on electricity generators and power banks.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,-0.2549019607843137,453901313,7,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1716196483.jpg,

Eight billion euros are waiting to help rebuild Britain's energy systems - but it could all flow to European rivals unless ministers start making decisions on our future electricity supplies, a leading energy boss has warned.

Mike Lockett, who runs the British assets of Uniper, the giant German state-owned electricity producer which produces 7pc of UK electricity, wants to clean up his fleet of six gas-fired power stations so that the millions of tonnes of CO2 they generate can be captured and buried underground.

But, he says, government delays in making crucial decisions, bringing in legislation and building key infrastructure are putting that investment in peril.

""This is the key challenge we face. We are happy to invest our earnings into decarbonisation. We can provide power generation and carbon capture on our sites.

""But we can only do it when there's the proper infrastructure to take that CO2 away and dispose of it. And we have to have the financial incentive to do it as well.""

Lockett is referring to the UK's three-decade flirtation with carbon capture and storage, a technology which holds out the hope of making fossil fuels clean, but where Britain's green ambition has repeatedly hit the buffers of economic reality.

The UK's first carbon capture project was proposed two decades ago - only for shocked Labour ministers to pull the plug in 2005 when they realised the likely impact on consumer bills.

Labour's Conservative and Lib Dem successors cancelled their own projects in 2012 and again in 2015. Carbon capture, they had all realised, would add an estimated 20pc to power generation costs, hitting consumers or taxpayers right where it hurts.

Carbon capture and storage is, however, an essential technology for reaching net zero, according to the Government's Climate Change Committee. So seven years ago our latest government decided to try again - promising companies like Uniper that this time they meant it.

Today, however, there are still no operating CO2 disposal projects. And that is why Mr Lockett, Uniper's UK chairman, is getting impatient. ""We've got a real sense of momentum, and we've got a target of capturing 20-30m tonnes per annum of CO2.

""But we need to see those next steps. We want to see financial investment decisions finally made on the UK's CO2 transport and storage systems.

""We want to see contracts awarded for carbon capture plants and projects such as our own, and then momentum turned into real action. It's becoming critical.""

What's at stake in simple terms is around €8bn (£6.9bn) set aside by Uniper for investment in low carbon power generation, to be spent by 2030. A chunk could come to the UK but other countries are available.

Uniper is an international energy company that operates roughly 22.5 gigawatts generation capacity across Germany, Holland, Sweden and Hungary, making it one of the world's largest power producers.

Well over half its generation comes from gas and coal - and Uniper has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2040.

Lockett is in a hurry to cut carbon. Later this year he will take a big step towards that goal by shutting down Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Britain's last coal-fired power station, sited just south of Nottingham.

The station is due to close in September, finally ending the UK's reliance on burning coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, to generate electricity.

Since it opened in 1967, Ratcliffe's four massive boiler units have generated 550 terawatt hours of electricity - enough to power the entire nation for around 18 months.

But they also consumed around 16,000 tonnes of coal a day and generated 8-10m tonnes of CO2 a year, making it one of Europe's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.

The UK is still reliant on power stations like Ratcliffe. In January, when the nation was hit by a period of windless, cold weather that left wind farms unable to cope, all four boilers were powered up.

That was, however, probably the last time they will all run - and Mr Lockett's attention is now focused on his remaining fleet of gas-fired power plants.

They include a large but ageing power station at Connah's Quay in North Wales, another equally large one on the Isle of Grain in Kent, and four smaller ones - collectively providing 4-5pc of the UK's electricity.

""We want to decarbonise all our plants using a combination of carbon capture and storage, low carbon fuels, such as hydrogen, or biomethane. We've drawn up plans for each of them and carbon capture storage in the UK market is one of the key routes to do that.""

What's missing, however, is the political leadership and that, says Mr Lockett, is becoming a problem.

At Connah's Quay, for example, the plan is to knock down the existing power station and build a new one, fired by gas but with carbon capture technology to pipe its CO2 emissions out beneath the Irish Sea. The Government has pledged to build those pipes - but so far it hasn't happened.

At Grain, similar technology would collect the CO2 and pump it into ships that would take it to a CO2 graveyard deep under the North Sea. But again there is no kit in place - and with an election looming, little sign of any decisions being taken.

Mr Lockett suggests that such indecision is fatal to big infrastructure projects. ""Many organisations like ours are ready to make big investment decisions, but they need to have confidence that their investments will not be stranded in the future.""

Continuity is key for the election too. ""The key thing for us is whatever happens in the election we need to see consistency of policy. We need to see whoever's in government continuing those policies and ploughing ahead with decarbonisation.""

What if they don't? ""We are really positive about our investments in the UK. But we've also got other core markets - and they are looking for investment too.""",telegraph.co.uk,news,The Telegraph,Jonathan Leake,0.1450980392156862,453899502,16,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2024/05/19/TELEMMGLPICT000376999710_17161379325580_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkfCJ0PDHtSt3Z5-Lj3ivHb112jqQ3Mz-kf5m8fbkA9A.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,

Even though the warm weather in recent days has lowered power usage and thus, the power deficit, the situation is said to remain critical.

""Thanks to warming and sunny weather, the deficit in the power system has decreased somewhat, but in the evening and night hours, the lack of electricity is significant.

The energy deficit is caused by Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, it said.

""We will remind you that the application of restrictive measures stems from the consequences of enemy missile attacks on Ukrainian power plants. From March 22 to May 8, the Russians targeted all large thermal and hydroelectric plants five times.

""Due to extensive damage, they cannot produce as much electricity as before the attacks began,"" it said, adding that Ukraine has been importing electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova to help cope with the deficit.

However, the power supply for critical infrastructure should not be affected, according to Ukrenergo's Facebook announcement made on Sunday evening.

Ukraine started to reintroduce nationwide energy restrictions in recent weeks following intensified Russian air strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure - enabled by the delay of Western air defense delivery - that has damaged or destroyed power plants and substations across the country.

An exclusive Kyiv Post report illustrates the aftermath of Russian strikes on the Trypillya Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in the Kyiv region in April; In early March this year, the Zmiyivska TPP in the Kharkiv region was also completely destroyed. Additionally, in July 2022, Russian troops occupied the Vuhlehirsk TPP in the Donetsk region.

On May 8, Ukraine announced plans to restrict power usage that evening, and it has since introduced multiple emergency blackouts across the country, including the western regions far from the front line.

About 90% of Ukraine's power generation capacity has been taken out by Russian missile attacks, according to former minister of infrastructure Aleksey Kucherenko.

The situation is not expected to improve dramatically, as the damaged infrastructure cannot be restored quickly, the member of parliament warned during an interview with the YouTube channel Vishka.

""We have lost around eight thousand megawatts of electricity, that's a lot, out of eight thousand, 800 are currently working,"" he said, citing power engineers, and warning of extensive power outages through the summer and winter.

Moscow began targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the autumn of 2022, after Russia's Crimean Bridge was bombed that October.

In recent months Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukrainian military and energy facilities. In April, the Russian Defense Ministry said the bombardment was in response to Kiev's attempts to target Russian oil infrastructure. Since January, Ukraine has launched multiple long-range attacks on energy facilities deep inside Russia, including oil depots and refineries, using kamikaze drones.

In April, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia's strikes on energy facilities ""directly affect the defense industry of Ukraine,"" calling them part of ""demilitarization"" efforts. Moscow reiterated the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations, and never at the civilian population.

To alleviate the pressure on the power grid, Ukraine has introduced temporary blackouts for industrial and household consumers in all regions. The nation has also ramped up imports of electricity from neighboring EU countries - Romania, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary - and also from Moldova.

Georgia is in turmoil over a law that threatens to stamp out opposition, independent media and activist groups by forcing them to declare their foreign funding sources. The Georgian government says it will make the country more transparent. But the law, which has now been approved by parliament, is a carbon copy of Russia's foreign agents legislation, which Vladimir Putin's government has used to wipe out all remnants of a democratic society in Russia. The foreign agents law, which pushes Georgia towards Russia's orbit, is a major shift in the country's direction. Since mid-April, the Georgian capital Tbilisi has erupted with protests, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets each day. Luka Gviniashvili, 24, is part of the protests' impassioned contingent of Gen Z participants, who are leaders in the movement.

I was born in Tbilisi's ancient bathing district, where hot, sulfurous water bubbles up from beneath the earth and steam escapes through the domed roofs of the old bathhouses.

As a kid, I always bubbled with energy too. I talk at triple speed, and people often have to tell me to slow down. My childhood neighborhood, the Abanotubani district, lies beneath a great gorge in Tbilisi. A huge, ruined fortress overlooks our neighborhood -- - for centuries, it served as a stronghold for Tbilisi, protecting it against invaders.

Now, views of the fortress are obscured by an even bigger mansion, built by the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, the richest man in our country. His wealth is about a third of our gross domestic product. Construction on his house began when I was a toddler: a great sea of glass and metal dominating the gorge. I remember looking up and thinking it looked like a Bond villain's lair.

Ivanishvili became the biggest philanthropist in Georgia, supporting arts and culture, fixing schools, houses and hospitals. But even as a young kid, I was doubtful that some billionaire was truly going to help our country.

Protests were the backdrop of my childhood in Georgia. One of my earliest memories is sitting on my dad's shoulders during the Rose Revolution. I was three. It was a peaceful uprising to oust the then-President Eduard Shevardnadze, ending his reign of chaos that had lasted more than a decade. A man called Mikheil Saakashvili was elected after him and set about trying to rid the country of the corruption that had plagued it for so long.

While there were problems during Saakashvili's rule, there was also a huge shift in the country towards democracy and reform. For a while, things felt hopeful.

Of course, we always lived below our powerful billionaire neighbor -- the oligarch Ivanishvili in his spy villain-worthy lair. But I also grew up being aware of another big neighbor, one that sat right above Georgia. On a clear day in the hills above my house in Tbilisi, you could see the Greater Caucasus mountain mange -- the natural border with Russia.

I was on holiday in those hills above Tbilisi in 2008 when Russia invaded Georgia. I remember the warplanes buzzing overhead and how my mom went into a panicked frenzy. During that war, Russia occupied South Ossetia, a region to the northwest of Tbilisi. I guess that was when I started to absorb the idea that Russia was not our friend.

When I was 12, a party called Georgian Dream came to power, backed by Ivanishvili, the billionaire who lived above us. Ivanishvili, like many oligarchs from the former Soviet space, has close ties to Putin. My parents felt uneasy about it all and moved the family to Paris, where I spent my teenage years.

We lived in the bougie 6th arrondissement. Kids at my school had no idea where Georgia was -- I was constantly having to explain that I was from the country, not the U.S. state. The country by the black sea -- ""la mere noire,"" I would intone, again and again. It was Georgia for dummies. People would nod, not quite knowing. One girl literally thought Georgia was a place in the Arctic region of Lapland. If I was giving her the benefit of the doubt, I guess she was thinking of the island of South Georgia in Antarctica. Wrong again. I realised it was often easier to just pretend I was French like everyone else.

As I grew older, though, I became prouder of my roots. I found a group of friends who came from all over. They introduced me to an important part of French life: going to protests. At those protests, I learned a lesson -- my voice matters.

The French really put the ""pro"" in protests -- they do not mess around. While I was in high school, the cops killed a French activist with a police grenade during a protest. It caused uproar across the country, so I tagged along with older kids to blockade our school, barricading it with trash cans for two weeks to push for justice for the guy who was killed.

I started to learn that protest actually works in a democracy. I would go between Paris and Tbilisi, taking lessons from my French friends and bringing them to Georgia. ""You guys go home too soon when you protest. You stand there and think stuff is going to fall out of the sky,"" I would tell my Georgian friends. Last year, though, a new law was proposed in Georgia, and things went full chaos-mode.

It's called the foreign agents law. It's a copycat of the same regulation in Russia. It dictates that any institution getting 20% of its money from abroad has to register with a statewide system as an agent of foreign influence.

In practice, it makes it easier for the state to crush opposition, get rid of foreign-aided projects that make our life better and stamp out free expression by creating scapegoats. It gives the government arbitrary reasons to arrest anyone they deem a ""foreign influence operation.""

Loads of my friends in Tbilisi work on projects that would be deemed a ""foreign agent"" by this new law. Whether they work in plastic recycling programs, as independent journalists or as human rights lawyers, they now face extra interrogation by the state. It's basically a tool for political repression.

The law's proposal last year lit a flame under us in Tbilisi. We organized big protests and for a while, it worked -- the government didn't press ahead. But this year, they tried again.

On April 3, the Georgian Dream party announced plans to bring back the bill. I felt a mixture of anger and hopelessness when I heard. Here we go again, I thought. Here's undeniable proof of our government blindly trying to follow Russia's lead. I got ready to fight.

Maybe if you had the privilege of growing up in a first-world country, you don't understand, but for us this law means the difference between having a functioning democracy and existing as a puppet for Russia. It means losing our freedom of speech.

Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia has looked westwards. Polls consistently show that around 80% of Georgians want the country to join the European Union and NATO. The ambition of being part of the European family is seen as the only way to protect Georgia from Russia, whose military already occupies a fifth of Georgia's internationally recognized territory. Since the foreign agent law was introduced in Russia in 2012, it has become a Kremlin soft power export and a major feature of the modern-day authoritarian playbook around the world, with countries including Nicaragua, Poland, Belarus, Hungary and Egypt all adopting copycat versionsof the legislation.

On the morning of April 15, the protests began.

My friends and I have joined the demonstrations every day, trying to put the lessons I'd learned in France into practice. I believe that if we can inspire enough people to get out on the streets, we can overwhelm the brutality we are fighting against. For now, the state is fighting back hard, with tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannon and by simply beating protesters to a pulp. I'm worried things are going to descend into even more violence, though I hope we can avoid it.

On the night of April 30, I put on a gas mask and assigned myself a task: deactivate as many tear gas canisters as I could. There's a couple of ways to do this. You can put a plastic cup over the canister before it starts to smoke, which snuffs it out. Or, if it's smoking already, you can dunk the canister in a bucket of water.

Things escalated fast that night. Protesters surged onto Tbilisi's main street, Rustaveli Avenue, and as they did, police unleashed a torrent of tear gas canisters onto us from the side streets, scattering the crowd. I ran forwards into the impact zone, grabbing the canisters and submerging them into bottles of water that I had previously set out. It was a race to get to the canisters before they started spinning out of control.

The police began advancing from the side streets and blasting everyone in the area with water cannon, throwing them to the ground. They didn't care if they hit protesters or journalists -- and they hit both. Officers also beat up anyone they could get their hands on. A no man's land emerged between the protesters and the police. In the buffer zone were journalists -- and me. Along with dealing with the tear gas, I was also taking pictures -- using loads of flash to annoy the officers -- just for my own personal project. I managed to capture several instances of how police laid into the protestors.

It was time to build barricades, French style, and invoke the lessons I had learned in Paris. I started dragging metal barrier fences together and getting people to help. I then told people to gather up trash cans, just like we did in high school. Five guys started to help me. From that moment on, I was standing in the buffer zone in front of the barricades, directing people like an orchestra conductor. I got them to add umbrellas to the structure -- a tactic inspired not by the French, but by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong -- to protect from the water cannon.

The crowd of police just watched as I directed the resistance. They recorded everything, sussing me out. Then, they mobilized the arresting squad. The police surged forward, grabbing anyone they could -- journalists, protesters, they didn't care. I started to run, but my fashion-victim status let me down, badly. I was wearing my cute new purple Adidas Sambas. But those shoes have no grip, as anyone who owns a pair knows. I slipped on the wet ground.

A bunch of masked police jumped on me and began beating me mercilessly. At one point I nearly scrambled away, but again my sartorial choices screwed me over. My blazer was tied around my waist and they grabbed it and pulled me back.

By law in Georgia, all police officers have to wear a visible badge number. But during the protests, police hide their badges and mask up with balaclavas, so it's difficult to prosecute them for brutality down the line.

They started hitting the back of my head hard, and all I could do was protect my eyes and curl into the fetal position. They dragged me behind the police line and continued laying into me. Then they surrounded me, taunting me, telling me to hit myself and say that I was a little bitch. My legs were like jelly and I could barely stand. I did whatever they ordered, desperate, until they threw me into a van. Already, there was a lump the size of a bar of soap on the back of my head, with deep blue panda rings forming around my eyes.

They hauled me to prison, but it took them six hours to get me inside. There was already a queue of other protesters they'd caught. My captors waited in the van with me, watching Russian TikToks for hours on end. Honestly, that was almost worse than the beating.

The atmosphere inside the cells was desperate. People were silently pacing up and down, their spirits hitting rock bottom. Police were bringing in more protesters all the time, their radios crackling. I was in a cell with three other guys. ""They beat me like a dog,"" one of them said, showing me a bootprint-shaped bruise on his back. I realized we had to get the morale up, fast -- and show the guards they couldn't break us.

We sang all the songs we could think of -- ""Bella Ciao,"" the European anthem, a bunch of Georgian songs. At one point I even sang the Marseillaise. The police told us to shut up. We kept singing, and cracked terrible jokes that this was a five-star digital detox.

I got out of jail because a lawyer helped me, pro bono. She works for the Young Lawyers Association, a group of human rights lawyers here in Georgia that under the new law would be at the top of the state's list of ""foreign agents."" That lawyer, she probably weighs 120 pounds, isn't much more than 5 feet tall, and she's formidable. When she goes into the police station, you see the fear in their eyes. She's the best. If it wasn't for her and her organization, I would still be in jail. This Russian law wants to take away our access to human rights lawyers like her.

Two weeks on, and my concussion is getting better, day by day. The nausea has eased and the daily headaches are becoming less intense.

I'm back on the streets. At these protests, the energy feels different. There's a crazy electricity in the air. Everyone is singing, fighting, determined not to lose their country. A lot of the protesters are my age -- Gen Z. We don't remember the chaos and corruption of the 1990s. We're not worn down, like older people, by decades of protesting. We're also more savvy than our parents' generation about fact-checking. We don't just swallow the stream of propaganda that's fed to us. We're ready to fight. I spoke with my uncle on the phone about it yesterday morning, just before the law was passed -- he told me ""my hopes are in Gen Z and a miracle"".

Their cost has fallen dramatically in recent years: by over 90% in 15 years, said Nikola Gazdov, Board member of SolarPower Europe and head of the Association for Production, Storage and Trading of Electricity (APSTE). In an interview for BTA, he commented on the trend of low or negative prices on the energy exchange due to the large production of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES) at certain times of the day.

In his words, the argument that batteries are expensive is no longer valid. Moreover, a lot of work has been done in Bulgaria and the region in recent years to develop a regulatory framework to create conditions for this type of investment. That is why the first battery installation projects are already being prepared in Bulgaria. ""I expect to see the effect of this very soon,"" Gazdov noted.

The APSTE head stressed that batteries will help to improve balancing at the system level and the management of these variable loads that come from RES. In addition, batteries will help investors and plant operators to improve their business model by storing the electricity produced when the market price is low and selling it at other times when it rises.

All countries in Southeast Europe have been betting on a rapid development of renewable energy in recent years. The first wave of projects on the market almost everywhere are solar plants, because they are faster from the beginning of development to project construction, Gazdov told BTA. He expects that in the coming years many new wind farms will join the grid in Bulgaria as well as in Greece, Romania, Serbia, Hungary and other countries in the region.

Lower prices on the energy exchange are not a problem for solar investors because they have to think long-term, Gazdov argued. The reason for the low and negative prices is because there are now indeed increased installed capacities of solar plants in Bulgaria, Greece and Romania. In Greece, there are already nearly 7,000 megawatts of solar power plants installed, and in Bulgaria there are over 3,000 MW. In Romania, too, more than 3,000 MW of electricity is produced by photovoltaic plants. These plants produce electricity from the sun at the same time because they are in the same region. When electricity is produced at the same time on days with low consumption, especially on weekends, it is normal for the price to be very low and even negative, because then there is less demand. However, this happens in transitional months - when it is warm enough not to use electricity for heating, but not yet too warm to use it for cooling, Gazdov pointed out.

According to him, negative prices are nothing new, but he hopes this phenomenon is temporary. In addition, more and more long-term contracts for the purchase of renewable energy are being signed. ""Long-term contracts are a risk management tool - both for RES producers and industrial consumers. This type of contract gives predictability to all parties and protects them from market volatility,"" said the APCTE head. He also said that for new RES projects there are cases even in Bulgaria where contracts are signed for 10 or even 12 years. There are examples of Bulgarian power plants signing contracts to sell electricity to consumers in Romania and Hungary. In long-term contracts, in most cases the price is fixed for a long period of time, Gazdov explained. The models may be different. There are variants where the so-called baseload is sold and the risk is shared in this transaction. This is a type of contract for difference.

The recent changes regarding the electricity balancing market, which introduced negative prices, should solve the problems with electricity surpluses, Gazdov believes. The reason is that no longer producing electricity according to the forecast schedule comes with a very serious financial penalty. ""Separately, these low prices and changes in the market have given a very strong market signal for investment in batteries,"" he added.",bta.bg,news,Българска Телеграфна Агенция,,0.1215686274509804,453801942,35,https://www.bta.bg/upload/6690393/20240516081210_MIL_9881.JPG?l=750,

Szijjarto, at a joint press conference in Budapest with his visiting Serbian counterpart, Marko Djuric, highlighted the development of bilateral ties in recent years, citing Serbia's grant of extensive rights to the Hungarian national minority in Vojvodina, as well as Hungary's reliance on natural gas from Serbia.

The two countries, plus Slovenia, have established a joint regional electricity exchange, which has enhanced supply and mitigated price rises.

Plans are also underway to build an oil pipeline connecting Hungary and Serbia, as well as Europe's most modern border crossing in the Roszke region. A railway line linking Budapest and Belgrade is expected to be completed by the end of next year.

Hungary is preparing for its upcoming presidency of the European Union (EU), during which it aims to advance Serbia's EU membership bid by opening the third chapter of accession negotiations, Szijjarto said.

He also announced Hungary's intention to vote against a UN General Assembly resolution that aims to ""demonize the entire Serbian nation"" in connection with the Srebrenica tragedy.

Hungary will also oppose Kosovo's membership application to the Council of Europe, advocating for the success of the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue before any application to international organizations, according to the top diplomat.

Djuric praised Hungary's achievements in defending its national interests and economic growth, which serve as an inspiration for Serbia.

BERLIN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Situated on the Adriatic coast of western Croatia, the Senj Wind Farm has reduced the country's carbon dioxide emissions by about 460,000 tons annually since it was inaugurated in 2021. The cheaper green electricity it generates satisfies the demand of more than 100,000 households in the country.

The green project, developed by China's Norinco International Cooperation Ltd., is a ""model of cooperation"" that benefits both countries, said Senj Mayor Jurica Tomljanovic. The revenue from its operation has been used to invest in infrastructure, water supply, sewerage, beaches and ""everything important for the residents"" in the city.

A beacon of the successful collaboration between China and Croatia, the wind farm also epitomizes the trend in recent years that the cooperation between China and European countries boasts great potential, particularly in green energy development.

As Chinese battery producer CATL announced the decision to build its second European battery plant in Hungary in 2022, the two countries have witnessed increasing cooperation in advancing many green projects. Chinese carmaker BYD also decided to invest in a production base for its electric vehicles (EVs) in the European country.

Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy regarded the investment that came along with the rise of China's EV industry as an opportunity. By welcoming Chinese companies, Hungary has become a hub for electric car and battery manufacturing.

Cooperation with China is not only beneficial to Hungary, but also to the EU as a whole, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

The BYD plant will boost Europe's green transformation and improve the wellbeing of local people. Moreover, healthy competition with Chinese companies has also promoted innovation and R&D by European companies, said Kiszelly.

The entry of Arcfox, the EV brand of Chinese giant automaker Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation, into the European market through Spain last week made another significant mark in China-Europe energy cooperation.

In collaboration with Spanish Atium Logistic Group, Arcfox has established a logistics center for vehicle storage, deposit, and exportation at the port of Ferrol in northwest Spain. The center will cover a storage area of 9,000 square meters. By 2025, the Chinese firm expects sales of 5,000-8,000 units in the European market.

""This is an initiative with a long-term vision that promotes Ferrol's prominence on the map of global logistics and, of course, of China, which could be a magnet for new investments,"" said Francisco Barea, president of the Port Authority of Ferrol.

In the northeastern Spanish city of Barcelona, a new pact signed in April between Spain's Ebro-EV Motors and China's Chery Automobile will not only turn the city into an EV production center but also deliver benefits to its residents.

The joint venture created by the pact will re-employ some 1,250 former auto manufacturing workers, who lost their jobs in 2021 when Nissan closed its Barcelona plant.

Rosa Maria Jimenez was one of them. ""For such a large and important company in China as Chery to come here means that we'll be able to continue doing what we know best, which is making cars,"" Jimenez told Xinhua.

""This is going to create many jobs and not only for the workers in the company itself but all those jobs around that are connected to a car manufacturer,"" Jimenez added. The joint venture is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles a year in the Zona Franca port area.

HIGHLY ANTICIPATED

The China-Europe cooperation in the green sector is poised to lead to more significant advancements in the global drive for sustainability.

Committed to providing high-quality products in coping with climate change, the Chinese new energy sector has contributed remarkably to the green transformation of countries worldwide, not least the EU members, said China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong in April.

As manufacturing powerhouses, China and Germany are reinforcing collaboration in emerging sectors, including EVs and other green transformations. A growing number of Chinese enterprises are seizing new opportunities in Europe's largest economy by joining hands with local partners. A report by the Germany Trade & Invest earlier this week showed the country's foreign direct investment projects from China in 2023 surged by 42 percent year-on-year.

According to the report, one-fifth of investment projects by Chinese companies went to Germany's renewable energy sector, tripling the number in 2022. The increasing global engagement of Chinese firms has benefited Germany, as their investments have contributed to Germany's goal of achieving climate-neutral production by 2045, said Thomas Bozoyan, author of the report.

""China and Germany could be important partners in the global climate goals, which can only be achieved together. We would welcome Chinese companies coming to Germany and producing here,"" Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday. She noted the rapid ramp-up of the Chinese EV market has benefited the European country technologically.

In April, Zhu Jing, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Mission to the EU, also highlighted the strong consensus between China and Europe on green and low-carbon development at a tech forum held in Brussels. He emphasized eco-friendly cooperation between the two parties, pointing to substantial opportunities for collaboration in technology research and development, standardization, and industrial development.

""The pressing challenges of climate change entails enhanced green cooperation between China and the EU, which will not only expedite their green transformation but also contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Zhu said.

OVERCAPACITY FALLACY

However, given the rise of China's EVs, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, as well as its promising green cooperation with the globe, some American politicians and media have employed the rhetoric of China's overcapacity in new energy industry.

Experts and officials from countries and international organizations refuted this fallacy and pointed out that politicizing China's new energy industry out of conservative protectionism to curb its development momentum shows no good signs for the global consensus and trend towards green and low-carbon pursuits, or for the burgeoning development of electric vehicles worldwide.

""The fact that buyers still desire Chinese EVs suggests that the global market is not saturated yet and the assertion of overcapacity in China may be misplaced,"" said Eunice Kamwendo, a senior official from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

Mueller also regarded the claim as ""questionable"", saying that ""the Chinese numbers do not speak for it.""

The German auto association chief said that around 16 percent of the cars produced in China are exported, while the German car industry has higher export figures, with three out of every four produced cars exported. ""We are not the right people to complain about overcapacity,"" instead, fair competition should be embraced globally and that is good for all parties, she emphasized.

Against the background of huge demand for new energy in the world, China's production capacity advantages have played an important role in promoting the globe's carbon-neutral goal. The green cooperation with China taking place in multiple European countries naturally dispels the unfounded claim.

From a global perspective, overcapacity in EVs is not happening, said Wu Kegang, a former China adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce. He suggested that more Chinese companies should consider deepening cooperation and building EV manufacturing closer to the UK and EU markets.

As to reducing global carbon emissions, Carl Fey, a professor of strategy at BI Norwegian Business School, told Xinhua, ""The Chinese government deserves a lot of credit for early recognizing and believing that electric vehicles could be a solution.""

In the short term, it's good that the Chinese companies produce more ""good quality, affordable electric cars from several manufacturers"" to the world; in the long run, it's also good that the European and U.S. vehicle-makers can compete in the global arena, Fey said.

""China has done a lot to help the world move towards a green future. And that is encouraging,"" he added.

Jesus is their savior, Trump is their candidate. Ex-president's backers say he shares faith, values

Donald Trump's support from white evangelicals and other conservative Christians is as strong as ever. And he's increasingly infusing his campaign events with Christian rhetoric and imagery. In some ways, this is a familiar story. The former president won about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christians' votes in 2016 and 2020. He has maintained support from this group in early primary contests this year, even though Republican voters had several openly conservative Christian candidates to choose from. None of them faced the legal troubles and misconduct allegations he does. This frustrates the minority of conservative evangelicals who see Trump as a poser and would-be authoritarian.

Ukraine's divisive mobilization law comes into force as a new Russian push strains front-line troops

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- A divisive mobilization law in Ukraine has come into force as Kyiv struggles to boost troop numbers after Russia launched a new offensive that some fear could close in on Ukraine's second-largest city. The legislation, which was watered down from its original draft, will make it easier to identify every conscript in the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed separate laws Friday that allow prisoners to join the army and increase fines for draft dodgers fivefold. Thousands of Ukrainians have fled the country to escape the draft, and some risked their lives as they tried to swim across a river to neighboring Romania and Hungary.

Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging

NEW YORK (AP) -- In recent months, the specter of people who aren't American citizens and are voting in the United States has become a rallying cry for Republicans. They say new legislation is necessary to protect the sanctity of the vote as the country faces unprecedented illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Voting by people who aren't U.S. citizens is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers. States have mechanisms to check whether voters on their rolls are citizens. Still, Republicans at the federal and state level are introducing legislation and fall ballot measures to ensure it remains at the forefront of voters' minds in November.

For decades, states have taken foster children's federal benefits. That's starting to change

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- States have for decades been using foster children's federal Social Security benefits to help cover the costs of state services. The practice has saved states millions of dollars. But that's beginning to change in some states under pressure from child advocates who contend it is immoral and detrimental to kids. Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

US intelligence suggests American who vanished in Syria in 2017 has died, daughter says she was told

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials have developed highly credible intelligence suggesting that an American citizen who disappeared seven years ago while traveling in Syria has died. That word comes from the man's daughter. Maryam Kamalmaz said in an interview Saturday with The Associated Press that during a meeting in Washington earlier this month with eight senior American officials she was presented with detailed intelligence about the presumed death of her father, Majd. The Texas psychotherapist disappeared in 2017 while traveling in Syria to visit an elderly family member. The FBI has said he was stopped at a Syrian government checkpoint in a suburb of Damascus and hasn't been heard from since.

Suspected would-be assassin ordered detained as Slovak prime minister's condition is stable

PEZINOK, Slovakia (AP) -- The man accused of attempting to assassinate Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has been ordered to remain behind bars. Fico is in serious but stable condition after surviving multiple gunshot wounds. A court spokesperson said Saturday prosecutors said they feared that if released the suspect could flee or carry out other crimes. Prosecutors told police not to publicly identify the man or release other details about the case, but unconfirmed media reports said he is a 71-year-old retiree known as an amateur poet who may have once worked as a mall security guard in the country's southwest. A government minister says Fico's condition is stable but he is still too ill to be transferred to the capital, Bratislava.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- States have for decades been using foster children's federal Social Security benefits to help cover the costs of state services. The practice has saved states millions of dollars. But that's beginning to change in some states under pressure from child advocates who contend it is immoral and detrimental to kids. Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

US intelligence suggests American who vanished in Syria in 2017 has died, daughter says she was told

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials have developed highly credible intelligence suggesting that an American citizen who disappeared seven years ago while traveling in Syria has died. That word comes from the man's daughter. Maryam Kamalmaz said in an interview Saturday with The Associated Press that during a meeting in Washington earlier this month with eight senior American officials she was presented with detailed intelligence about the presumed death of her father, Majd. The Texas psychotherapist disappeared in 2017 while traveling in Syria to visit an elderly family member. The FBI has said he was stopped at a Syrian government checkpoint in a suburb of Damascus and hasn't been heard from since.

Suspected would-be assassin ordered detained as Slovak prime minister's condition is stable

PEZINOK, Slovakia (AP) -- The man accused of attempting to assassinate Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has been ordered to remain behind bars. Fico is in serious but stable condition after surviving multiple gunshot wounds. A court spokesperson said Saturday prosecutors said they feared that if released the suspect could flee or carry out other crimes. Prosecutors told police not to publicly identify the man or release other details about the case, but unconfirmed media reports said he is a 71-year-old retiree known as an amateur poet who may have once worked as a mall security guard in the country's southwest. A government minister says Fico's condition is stable but he is still too ill to be transferred to the capital, Bratislava.

Here's how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could make the first debate stage under stringent Biden-Trump rules

PHOENIX (AP) -- To make the first debate stage, Robert F. Kennedy has to secure a ballot place in at least a dozen more states and improve his showing in national polls. And he has just one month to do it. That's due to rules set by the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission. Kennedy has already reached two of the four poll results he needs. But ballot access is his biggest hurdle. Adding up all the states that have confirmed he's on the ballot or where he says he has eligibility totals 201 votes in the Electoral College. CNN is requiring that candidates be on the ballot in states adding up to 270 votes.

Donald Trump will address the NRA in Texas. He's called himself the best president for gun owners

DALLAS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump is expected to address thousands of members of the National Rifle Association in Texas a day after campaigning in Minnesota in the midst of his hush money trial. Trump has pledged to continue to defend the Second Amendment and has called himself ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House."" The United States faces record numbers of deaths due to mass shootings. Last year ended with 42 mass killings and 217 deaths, making it one of the deadliest years on record. Vice President Kamala Harris is accusing Trump of ""catering to the gun lobby and threatening to make the crisis worse if reelected.""

Widespread power outages from deadly Houston storm raise new risk: hot weather

HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to thousands after deadly storms that left at least seven dead, it will do so under a smog warning and as southern Texas starts to feel the heat. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that with temperatures around 90 degrees this weekend, people should know the symptoms of heat exhaustion as they start cleaning up. The balmy weather is a concern in a region where more than a half-million homes and businesses remained without electricity Saturday morning. The area was hit with fierce storms Thursday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour.

Sean 'Diddy' Combs abuse allegations: A timeline of key events

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New video aired by CNN appears to show Sean ""Diddy"" Combs beating his former singing protege and girlfriend Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. The video appears six months after Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit that set off a wave of similar cases. Ventura's lawsuit was settled the following day. But two more women filed lawsuits alleging sexual abuse from Combs about a week later. More suits followed between December and February. In March, Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami were searched by federal authorities in a criminal investigation.

Ukraine's divisive mobilization law comes into force as a new Russian push strains front-line troops

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- A divisive mobilization law in Ukraine has come into force as Kyiv struggles to boost troop numbers after Russia launched a new offensive that some fear could close in on Ukraine's second-largest city. The legislation, which was watered down from its original draft, will make it easier to identify every conscript in the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed separate laws Friday that allow prisoners to join the army and increase fines for draft dodgers fivefold. Thousands of Ukrainians have fled the country to escape the draft, and some risked their lives as they tried to swim across a river to neighboring Romania and Hungary.

Voting by people who aren't U.S. citizens is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers. States have mechanisms to check whether voters on their rolls are citizens.

Flash floods due to unusually heavy seasonal rains kill at least 68 people in Afghanistan

ISLAMABAD (AP) -- Taliban officials say flash floods from heavy seasonal rains have killed at least 68 people in Afghanistan, adding the death toll was based on preliminary reports. In the hard-hit western province of Ghor, 50 people were reported dead. The province has also suffered significant financial losses after thousands of homes and properties were damaged and hundreds of hectares of agricultural land destroyed following Friday's floods. Meanwhile, 18 people in the northern province of Farayab were killed and two others injured. Damages to property and land were also reported and over 300 animals were killed. Last week, the U.N. food agency said the exceptionally heavy rains in Afghanistan have killed more than 300 people.

RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif.

The earth beneath The Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes is moving an unprecedented 2 feet or more each month. Intended to celebrate the natural world, the chapel is instead being destroyed by it. The chapel was designated as a National Historic Landmark in December 2023 and closed just two months later from the worsening effects of the 1956 Portuguese Bend landslide. Restoration is expected to cost at least $20 million.

Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

The Slovak prime minister is stable after 'miracles' in the hospital as suspect appears in court

PEZINOK, Slovakia (AP) -- A government minister says Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's condition is stable but serious as the man accused of trying to assassinate him faced his first court appearance. Health Minister Zuzana Dolinkova said Saturday that two-hour surgery to remove dead tissue from multiple gunshot wounds ""contributed to a positive prognosis"" for Fico. Defense Minister Robert Kalinak says his condition still makes it impossible to transport him to the capital, Bratislava. The update was issued as prosecutors sought to detain the man accused of shooting Fico in an assassination attempt.

Here's how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could make the first debate stage under stringent Biden-Trump rules

PHOENIX (AP) -- To make the first debate stage, Robert F. Kennedy has to secure a ballot place in at least a dozen more states and improve his showing in national polls. And he has just one month to do it. That's due to rules set by the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission. Kennedy has already reached two of the four poll results he needs. But ballot access is his biggest hurdle. Adding up all the states that have confirmed he's on the ballot or where he says he has eligibility totals 201 votes in the Electoral College. CNN is requiring that candidates be on the ballot in states adding up to 270 votes.

Donald Trump will address the NRA in Texas. He's called himself the best president for gun owners

DALLAS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump is expected to address thousands of members of the National Rifle Association in Texas a day after campaigning in Minnesota in the midst of his hush money trial. Trump has pledged to continue to defend the Second Amendment and has called himself ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House."" The United States faces record numbers of deaths due to mass shootings. Last year ended with 42 mass killings and 217 deaths, making it one of the deadliest years on record. Vice President Kamala Harris is accusing Trump of ""catering to the gun lobby and threatening to make the crisis worse if reelected.""

Widespread power outages from deadly Houston storm raise new risk: hot weather

HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to thousands after deadly storms that left at least seven dead, it will do so Saturday under a smog warning and as southern Texas starts to feel the heat. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that with temperatures around 90 degrees this weekend, people should know the symptoms of heat exhaustion as they start cleaning up. The balmy weather is a concern in a region where more than a half-million homes and businesses remained without electricity Saturday morning. The area was hit with fierce storms Thursday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour.

Landslide forces closure of iconic Southern California chapel designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son

RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. (AP) -- A decades-old landslide that's rapidly accelerating has forced the dismantling of an iconic Southern California chapel known for its glass frame built among soaring redwoods and sweeping Pacific Ocean views. The earth beneath The Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes is moving an unprecedented 2 feet or more each month. Intended to celebrate the natural world, the chapel is instead being destroyed by it. The chapel was designated as a National Historic Landmark in December 2023 and closed just two months later from the worsening effects of the 1956 Portuguese Bend landslide. Restoration is expected to cost at least $20 million.

Ukraine's divisive mobilization law comes into force as a new Russian push strains front-line troops

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- A divisive mobilization law in Ukraine has come into force as Kyiv struggles to boost troop numbers after Russia launched a new offensive that some fear could close in on Ukraine's second-largest city. The legislation, which was watered down from its original draft, will make it easier to identify every conscript in the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed separate laws Friday that allow prisoners to join the army and increase fines for draft dodgers fivefold. Thousands of Ukrainians have fled the country to escape the draft, and some risked their lives as they tried to swim across a river to neighboring Romania and Hungary.

Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging

NEW YORK (AP) -- In recent months, the specter of people who aren't American citizens and are voting in the United States has become a rallying cry for Republicans. They say new legislation is necessary to protect the sanctity of the vote as the country faces unprecedented illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Voting by people who aren't U.S. citizens is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers. States have mechanisms to check whether voters on their rolls are citizens. Still, Republicans at the federal and state level are introducing legislation and fall ballot measures to ensure it remains at the forefront of voters' minds in November.

Flash floods due to unusually heavy seasonal rains kill at least 68 people in Afghanistan

ISLAMABAD (AP) -- Taliban officials say flash floods from heavy seasonal rains have killed at least 68 people in Afghanistan, adding the death toll was based on preliminary reports. In the hard-hit western province of Ghor, 50 people were reported dead. The province has also suffered significant financial losses after thousands of homes and properties were damaged and hundreds of hectares of agricultural land destroyed following Friday's floods. Meanwhile, 18 people in the northern province of Farayab were killed and two others injured. Damages to property and land were also reported and over 300 animals were killed. Last week, the U.N. food agency said the exceptionally heavy rains in Afghanistan have killed more than 300 people.

Health Minister Zuzana Dolinkova said Saturday that two-hour surgery to remove dead tissue from multiple gunshot wounds ""contributed to a positive prognosis"" for Fico. Defense Minister Robert Kalinak says his condition still makes it impossible to transport him to the capital, Bratislava. The update was issued as prosecutors sought to detain the man accused of shooting Fico in an assassination attempt.

Here's how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could make the first debate stage under stringent Biden-Trump rules

PHOENIX (AP) -- To make the first debate stage, Robert F. Kennedy has to secure a ballot place in at least a dozen more states and improve his showing in national polls. And he has just one month to do it. That's due to rules set by the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission. Kennedy has already reached two of the four poll results he needs. But ballot access is his biggest hurdle. Adding up all the states that have confirmed he's on the ballot or where he says he has eligibility totals 201 votes in the Electoral College. CNN is requiring that candidates be on the ballot in states adding up to 270 votes.

Flash floods due to unusually heavy seasonal rains kill at least 68 people in Afghanistan

ISLAMABAD (AP) -- Taliban officials say flash floods from heavy seasonal rains have killed at least 68 people in Afghanistan, adding the death toll was based on preliminary reports.

Widespread power outages from deadly Houston storm raise new risk: hot weather

HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to thousands after deadly storms that left at least seven dead, it will do so Saturday under a smog warning and as southern Texas starts to feel the heat. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that with temperatures around 90 degrees this weekend, people should know the symptoms of heat exhaustion as they start cleaning up. The balmy weather is a concern in a region where more than a half-million homes and businesses remained without electricity Saturday morning. The area was hit with fierce storms Thursday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour.

Landslide forces closure of iconic Southern California chapel designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son

RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. (AP) -- A decades-old landslide that's rapidly accelerating has forced the dismantling of an iconic Southern California chapel known for its glass frame built among soaring redwoods and sweeping Pacific Ocean views. The earth beneath The Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes is moving an unprecedented 2 feet or more each month. Intended to celebrate the natural world, the chapel is instead being destroyed by it. The chapel was designated as a National Historic Landmark in December 2023 and closed just two months later from the worsening effects of the 1956 Portuguese Bend landslide. Restoration is expected to cost at least $20 million.

Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging

NEW YORK (AP) -- In recent months, the specter of noncitizens voting in the U.S. has erupted into a leading rallying cry for Republicans. They say new legislation is necessary to protect the sanctity of the vote as the country faces unprecedented illegal immigration at its southern border. Noncitizen voting already is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers. States have mechanisms to check whether voters on their rolls are citizens. Still, Republicans at the federal and state level are introducing legislation and fall ballot measures to ensure it remains at the forefront of voters' minds in November.

The United States faces record numbers of deaths due to mass shootings. Last year ended with 42 mass killings and 217 deaths, making it one of the deadliest years on record.

For decades, states have taken foster children's federal benefits. That's starting to change

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- States have for decades been using foster children's federal Social Security benefits to help cover the costs of state services. The practice has saved states millions of dollars. But that's beginning to change in some states under pressure from child advocates who contend it is immoral and detrimental to kids. Since 2018, at least a dozen states have taken some steps to either halt, scale back or provide greater notice of their use of children's benefits to cover required foster care costs. Some states have enacted laws requiring those funds to instead be set aside for the child's future needs as they transition to adulthood.

Szijjarto, at a joint press conference in Budapest with his visiting Serbian counterpart, Marko Djuric, highlighted the development of bilateral ties in recent years, citing Serbia's grant of extensive rights to the Hungarian national minority in Vojvodina, as well as Hungary's reliance on natural gas from Serbia.

The two countries, plus Slovenia, have established a joint regional electricity exchange, which has enhanced supply and mitigated price rises.

Plans are also underway to build an oil pipeline connecting Hungary and Serbia, as well as Europe's most modern border crossing in the Roszke region. A railway line linking Budapest and Belgrade is expected to be completed by the end of next year.

Hungary is preparing for its upcoming presidency of the European Union (EU), during which it aims to advance Serbia's EU membership bid by opening the third chapter of accession negotiations, Szijjarto said.

He also announced Hungary's intention to vote against a UN General Assembly resolution that aims to ""demonize the entire Serbian nation"" in connection with the Srebrenica tragedy.

Hungary will also oppose Kosovo's membership application to the Council of Europe, advocating for the success of the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue before any application to international organizations, according to the top diplomat.

Djuric praised Hungary's achievements in defending its national interests and economic growth, which serve as an inspiration for Serbia.

He also conveyed a message from President Aleksandar Vucic, affirming that Serbia will not forget Hungary's friendship and support, and underlined the importance of the exemplary minority rights enjoyed by the Serbian community in Hungary.",timesofoman.com,news,Times of Oman,http,0.08235294117647052,453728557,26,https://shabiba.eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/2024/05/1716031842-1716031842-ztdglu5v22rm-700x400.png,

Trucks are rolling across a new US pier into Gaza. But challenges remain to getting enough aid in

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip have rolled across a newly built U.S. pier and into the besieged enclave for the first time. Friday's shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day. It comes as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies seven months into the Israel-Hamas war. But the U.S. and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered the territory on an average day.

Slovak prime minister still in serious condition as suspect appears in court

PEZINOK, Slovakia (AP) -- A government minister says Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's condition is stable but serious as the man accused of trying to assassinate him faces his first court appearance. Health Minister Zuzana Dolinkova said Saturday that two-hour surgery to remove dead tissue from multiple gunshot wounds ""contributed to a positive prognosis"" for Fico. Defense Minister Robert Kalinak says his condition still makes it impossible to transport him to Bratislava. The update came as the man accused of attempting to assassinate him made his first court appearance.

Noncitizen voting, already illegal in federal elections, becomes a centerpiece of 2024 GOP messaging

NEW YORK (AP) -- In recent months, the specter of noncitizens voting in the U.S. has erupted into a leading rallying cry for Republicans. They say new legislation is necessary to protect the sanctity of the vote as the country faces unprecedented illegal immigration at its southern border. Noncitizen voting already is illegal in federal elections, and there is no indication it's happening anywhere in significant numbers. States have mechanisms to check whether voters on their rolls are citizens. Still, Republicans at the federal and state level are introducing legislation and fall ballot measures to ensure it remains at the forefront of voters' minds in November.

Donald Trump will address the NRA in Texas. He's called himself the best president for gun owners

DALLAS (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump is expected to address thousands of members of the National Rifle Association in Texas a day after campaigning in Minnesota in the midst of his hush money trial. Trump has pledged to continue to defend the Second Amendment and has called himself ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House."" The country faces record numbers of deaths due to mass shootings. Last year ended with 42 mass killings and 217 deaths, making it one of the deadliest years on record.

Even with school choice, some Black families find options lacking decades after Brown v. Board

The 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling and desegregation orders were only the first steps toward the elusive goal of equitable education. For many Black families, school choice has been critical to finding at least the option that works best for them. And that has not necessarily meant the school with the highest levels of racial integration. Some families describe being torn between schools where their children will feel more included on one hand or schools where they might have better academic opportunities on the other hand.

Widespread power outages from deadly Houston storm raise new risk: hot weather

HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston area works to clean up and restore power to thousands after deadly storms, it will do so Saturday under a smog warning and as all of southern Texas starts to feel the heat. The National Weather Service in Houston warned that with temperatures hitting around 90 degrees this weekend, people should know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and not ""overdo yourself during the cleanup process."" The balmy weather is a concern in a region where more than 555,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity Friday night. The area was hit with fierce storms Thursday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour.

Flash floods due to unusually heavy seasonal rains kill at least 50 people in western Afghanistan

ISLAMABAD (AP) -- A Taliban official says flash floods from heavy seasonal rains in western Afghanistan have killed at least 50 people and dozens remain missing, adding the death toll was based on preliminary reports and might rise. The hard-hit province of Ghor has suffered significant financial losses, said Abdul Wahid Hamas, spokesman for the provincial governor, after thousands of homes and properties were damaged and hundreds of hectares of agricultural land destroyed following Friday's floods. Last week, the U.N. food agency said the exceptionally heavy rains in Afghanistan have killed more than 300 people, mostly in the province of Baghlan.

Szijjártó said friendship and mutual respect were ""invaluable"" in light of the heightened tensions in the region, noting the war in Ukraine and the assassination attempt against Slovakia's prime minister.

He welcomed that his Serbian counterpart, Marko Djuric, had made Budapest his first destination for an official visit following his appointment.

Szijjártó praised the ""great developments"" seen between Hungary and Serbia in recent years, highlighting that of all of Hungary's neighbours, Serbia guaranteed the most rights to its ethnic Hungarian minority, even including Vojvodina Hungarians in the country's governance.

""The security of Hungary's energy supply is in Serbia's hands,"" he said, noting that Hungary's gas supply went through Serbia, and ""we can always sleep easy regarding the transit.""

He noted that Hungary, Serbia and Slovenia had started operating a joint regional electricity exchange, which had given a further boost to energy security, and had also been ""an excellent measure"" against rising prices.

Hungary and Serbia, he said, would build an oil pipeline linking their countries, as well as ""Europe's most modern border crossing point"" at Röszke. We detailed that project HERE. He said they were aiming to complete the construction of the railway line linking Budapest and Belgrade by the end of next year, and that Hungary would continue to store gas on Serbia's behalf.

Meanwhile, Szijjártó said that during its presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of the year, Hungary would bring Serbia closer to EU membership and had a clear goal of opening the third EU accession chapter with the country.

He said Hungary considered it ""unacceptable, unfair and humiliating"" that the EU had been making Serbia wait for 15 years now when in its ""declining shape"" the bloc ""needs the momentum Serbia would guarantee more than Serbians need EU membership"". He called on EU member states to ""end their hypocrisy and come clean on why they've put obstacles in the way of the progress of Serbia's accession"".

Szijjártó also touched on next Thursday's scheduled UN General Assembly vote on a resolution ""seeking to demonise the entire Serb nation"" in connection with the Srebrenica massacre. Hungary will vote against the resolution, he said, adding that it would also vote against Kosovo joining the Council of Europe. Szijjártó said it was necessary to ""wait until the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina proves successful, and only then will it be worthwhile for Kosovo to apply to join international organisations"".

Djuric called it an ""honour"" that he had been able to start seeing to his official duties with a visit to Hungary, ""reaffirming the excellent relationship Serbia and Hungary have built in recent years, which is a great joy for both nations"".

He said Hungary's accomplishments in protecting its national interests and economic growth were ""inspiring"" to Serbia

He welcomed that Hungary was next in line to take over the EU's rotating presidency, saying it would give Serbia and the entire region ""a reliable partner"" and that he expected Hungary to be a leader that would assume responsibility for European interests.

Djuric thanked Hungary for its support in connection with the UN resolution, pointing out that ""the opening up of old wounds by certain political circles"" had created tensions in the region among Serbs, Croats and Bosnians. Hungary, he said, supported stability on this issue as well, adding that this was ""a responsible approach"".",dailynewshungary.com,news,Daily News Hungary,,0.2627450980392156,453716938,54,https://contentf5.dailynewshungary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/New-Serbian-foreign-ministers-first-visit-was-in-Budapest.jpg,

BERLIN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Situated on the Adriatic coast of western Croatia, the Senj Wind Farm has reduced the country's carbon dioxide emissions by about 460,000 tons annually since it was inaugurated in 2021. The cheaper green electricity it generates satisfies the demand of more than 100,000 households in the country.

The green project, developed by China's Norinco International Cooperation Ltd., is a ""model of cooperation"" that benefits both countries, said Senj Mayor Jurica Tomljanovic. The revenue from its operation has been used to invest in infrastructure, water supply, sewerage, beaches and ""everything important for the residents"" in the city.

A beacon of the successful collaboration between China and Croatia, the wind farm also epitomizes the trend in recent years that the cooperation between China and European countries boasts great potential, particularly in green energy development.

WIN-WIN GREEN COOPERATION

As Chinese battery producer CATL announced the decision to build its second European battery plant in Hungary in 2022, the two countries have witnessed increasing cooperation in advancing many green projects. Chinese carmaker BYD also decided to invest in a production base for its electric vehicles (EVs) in the European country.

Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy regarded the investment that came along with the rise of China's EV industry as an opportunity. By welcoming Chinese companies, Hungary has become a hub for electric car and battery manufacturing.

Cooperation with China is not only beneficial to Hungary, but also to the EU as a whole, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

The BYD plant will boost Europe's green transformation and improve the wellbeing of local people. Moreover, healthy competition with Chinese companies has also promoted innovation and R&D by European companies, said Kiszelly.

The entry of Arcfox, the EV brand of Chinese giant automaker Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation, into the European market through Spain last week made another significant mark in China-Europe energy cooperation.

In collaboration with Spanish Atium Logistic Group, Arcfox has established a logistics center for vehicle storage, deposit, and exportation at the port of Ferrol in northwest Spain. The center will cover a storage area of 9,000 square meters. By 2025, the Chinese firm expects sales of 5,000-8,000 units in the European market.

""This is an initiative with a long-term vision that promotes Ferrol's prominence on the map of global logistics and, of course, of China, which could be a magnet for new investments,"" said Francisco Barea, president of the Port Authority of Ferrol.

In the northeastern Spanish city of Barcelona, a new pact signed in April between Spain's Ebro-EV Motors and China's Chery Automobile will not only turn the city into an EV production center but also deliver benefits to its residents.

The joint venture created by the pact will re-employ some 1,250 former auto manufacturing workers, who lost their jobs in 2021 when Nissan closed its Barcelona plant.

Rosa Maria Jimenez was one of them. ""For such a large and important company in China as Chery to come here means that we'll be able to continue doing what we know best, which is making cars,"" Jimenez told Xinhua.

""This is going to create many jobs and not only for the workers in the company itself but all those jobs around that are connected to a car manufacturer,"" Jimenez added. The joint venture is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles a year in the Zona Franca port area.

HIGHLY ANTICIPATED

The China-Europe cooperation in the green sector is poised to lead to more significant advancements in the global drive for sustainability.

Committed to providing high-quality products in coping with climate change, the Chinese new energy sector has contributed remarkably to the green transformation of countries worldwide, not least the EU members, said China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong in April.

As manufacturing powerhouses, China and Germany are reinforcing collaboration in emerging sectors, including EVs and other green transformations. A growing number of Chinese enterprises are seizing new opportunities in Europe's largest economy by joining hands with local partners. A report by the Germany Trade &Invest earlier this week showed the country's foreign direct investment projects from China in 2023 surged by 42 percent year-on-year.

According to the report, one-fifth of investment projects by Chinese companies went to Germany's renewable energy sector, tripling the number in 2022. The increasing global engagement of Chinese firms has benefited Germany, as their investments have contributed to Germany's goal of achieving climate-neutral production by 2045, said Thomas Bozoyan, author of the report.

""China and Germany could be important partners in the global climate goals, which can only be achieved together. We would welcome Chinese companies coming to Germany and producing here,"" Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday. She noted the rapid ramp-up of the Chinese EV market has benefited the European country technologically.

In April, Zhu Jing, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Mission to the EU, also highlighted the strong consensus between China and Europe on green and low-carbon development at a tech forum held in Brussels. He emphasized eco-friendly cooperation between the two parties, pointing to substantial opportunities for collaboration in technology research and development, standardization, and industrial development.

""The pressing challenges of climate change entails enhanced green cooperation between China and the EU, which will not only expedite their green transformation but also contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Zhu said.

OVERCAPACITY FALLACY

However, given the rise of China's EVs, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, as well as its promising green cooperation with the globe, some American politicians and media have employed the rhetoric of China's overcapacity in new energy industry.

Experts and officials from countries and international organizations refuted this fallacy and pointed out that politicizing China's new energy industry out of conservative protectionism to curb its development momentum shows no good signs for the global consensus and trend towards green and low-carbon pursuits, or for the burgeoning development of electric vehicles worldwide.

""The fact that buyers still desire Chinese EVs suggests that the global market is not saturated yet and the assertion of overcapacity in China may be misplaced,"" said Eunice Kamwendo, a senior official from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

Mueller also regarded the claim as ""questionable"", saying that ""the Chinese numbers do not speak for it.""

The German auto association chief said that around 16 percent of the cars produced in China are exported, while the German car industry has higher export figures, with three out of every four produced cars exported. ""We are not the right people to complain about overcapacity,"" instead, fair competition should be embraced globally and that is good for all parties, she emphasized.

Against the background of huge demand for new energy in the world, China's production capacity advantages have played an important role in promoting the globe's carbon-neutral goal. The green cooperation with China taking place in multiple European countries naturally dispels the unfounded claim.

From a global perspective, overcapacity in EVs is not happening, said Wu Kegang, a former China adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce. He suggested that more Chinese companies should consider deepening cooperation and building EV manufacturing closer to the UK and EU markets.

As to reducing global carbon emissions, Carl Fey, a professor of strategy at BI Norwegian Business School, told Xinhua, ""The Chinese government deserves a lot of credit for early recognizing and believing that electric vehicles could be a solution.""

In the short term, it's good that the Chinese companies produce more ""good quality, affordable electric cars from several manufacturers"" to the world; in the long run, it's also good that the European and U.S. vehicle-makers can compete in the global arena, Fey said.

""China has done a lot to help the world move towards a green future. And that is encouraging,"" he added.",en.people.cn,news,"People's Daily, China",,0.4745098039215687,453704323,13,,

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has emphasised the need to diversify resources for social housing development, from the State, the public, society and financial institutions, in order to provide support for both sellers and buyers.

PM Chinh made this call while chairing a meeting with ministries and agencies in Hanoi on May 17 to discuss solutions to social housing development, as part of a project aiming to construct at least 1 million social housing units for low-income earners and industrial zone workers in the 2021-2030 period.

He acknowledged that key hurdles relating to land allocation, administrative procedures and real estate regulations have been largely resolved, saying that the laws on land, housing, real estate business and credit institutions have been issued, and what matters now is how to put them into practice.

The localities were urged to proactively engage in specific programmes, plans and projects while procedures and conditions for borrowers seeking social housing must be simplified, he said.

The leader also urged building and issuing a resolution allowing the Land Law, Housing Law and Real Estate Business Law to take effect early from July 1, 2024, and the early enforcement of preferential policies for social housing projects.

The PM assigned specific tasks to relevant ministries, local authorities and investors to ensure the successful implementation of the project.

Currently, Vietnam now has 503 underway social housing projects, providing a total of 418,200 apartments./.

Vietnam, AFD strengthen cooperation, promote energy transition

Vietnam wants to deepen the traditional reliable relations and strategic partnership with France, particularly the French Development Agency (AFD), said Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha while receiving AFD Deputy Director General Marie-Hélène Loison in Hanoi.

During the reception, Ha appreciated the results of AFD's activities in Vietnam as well as changes in its organisational apparatus for wider and more effective access to new development fields.

Ha said that besides institutionalising mechanisms and policies on green transition and just energy transition, Vietnam needs advice on techniques, institutional improvement, technology selection, governance models, and financial resources in the fields of energy, transportation, agriculture, and urban areas.

Such advice will help Vietnam to determine actual needs, and plans for effective use of domestic resources, loans, and sponsorship sources, Ha said.

He noted that AFD's studies on green transition, climate change response, and energy transition will provide ""solution packages"" for investment, science and technology, and technical infrastructure development in Vietnam.

Regarding green transition and just energy transition, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Government of Vietnam is discussing with partners to soon pilot several offshore wind power projects, adding the country also promotes the participation of the private sector in renewable electricity production.

""AFD's research results can also support French businesses to find investment and business cooperation projects in Vietnam,"" Ha said.

For her part, Marie-Hélène Loison affirmed that AFD and its partners are always ready to provide technical advice and support for Vietnam to improve the legal framework, find financial sources to implement important socio-economic development programmes and projects in Vietnam, especially in the fields of energy transition, climate change response, and green transition.

Since 2019, AFD has coordinated with the Vietnamese side to implement a project to research the socio-economic impacts of climate change in Vietnam and the climate change adaptation strategy. The two sides have launched Phase 2 of the project with priority given to assessing the socio-economic impacts of the energy transition process in Vietnam./.

65th anniversary of Ho Chi Minh Trail marked in Quang Binh

A ceremony to mark the 65th anniversary of the Truong Son - Ho Chi Minh Trail (1959 - 2024) took place in Bo Trach district, the central province of Quang Binh, on May 17, highlighting the significance of the legendary road in the country's resistance war against the US and today's socio-economic development.

The event was attended by 200 delegates, including former pioneering youths and members of youth unions from the provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien - Hue, and Quang Nam in the central region, Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Kon Tum and Dak Nong in the Central Highlands, and Binh Phuoc in the south, which the trail traversed.

In his remarks, Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union Central Committee Ngo Van Cuong said the Ho Chi Minh Trail, also called Truong Son Trail, went down in the country's history as a legendary route and a miracle, and became a symbol for educating today's young generation about the revolutionary ideal and the spirit of overcoming challenges.

It also holds practical significance in the current national construction and defence, he noted.

Sixty-five years ago, to carry out the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission's policy on opening a route to deliver support to the revolution in the South, thanks to extraordinary efforts and the determination of reunifying the nation, forces built a strategic transportation route from rudimentary trails along the majestic Truong Son Mountain Range.

The Truong Son - Ho Chi Minh Trail spanned nearly 17,000km, including five vertical routes along the Truong Son Range and 21 horizontal ones connecting strategic areas, fuel pipelines, and communication lines, among many others. The system of arteries served as not only a strategic military transportation and logistics network but also a fierce battlefront, vividly demonstrating the solidarity in combat among Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

As part of the activities commemorating the trail's 65th anniversary, between May 15 and 17, representatives of the former pioneering youths and youth union members held a programme in the provinces to express gratitude to the war veterans and former pioneering youths who once performed duties along the legendary trail./.

Nam Dinh border guard force works hard to prevent IUU fishing

Along with increasing patrol on waters under its management, the border guard force of the northern province of Nam Dinh has strictly managed the movement of local fishing vessels to ensure that no vessel without enough documents and equipment can go offshore, thus preventing illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

Major Vu Chi Cong, head of the border post at Hai Thinh Port said that along with combating all kinds of criminals in the sea border area, the post has sent officials and soldiers to local vessels to educate fishermen on IUU fishing prevention and control regulations.

New head coach Hua Dien Vinh has called up 29 players for the camp, including many from the U17 squad competing at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) U17 Asian Cup 2023 in Thailand and the friendship tournament of U18 Seoul Eou Cup in the Republic of Korea (RoK) also last year.

Some of the footballers used to receive training at the clubs playing at J. League of Japan under the VFF's cooperation with the Japan Football Association.

However, the training camp has yet to gather all the best U19 players as many are still playing at their clubs at domestic tourneys.

The first training session will take place at the Vietnam Youth Football Training Centre on May 17 morning.

The team are scheduled to leave for China on June 2 to play at the international U19 tournament held by the Chinese Football Association.

Apart from hosts China, this event will also see the participation of the teams from Uzbekistan and the RoK. It is considered a test for the Vietnamese players before competing at the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) U19 Youth Championship 2024 and the AFC U20 Asian Cup 2025 qualification./.

Da Nang's health care service to go digital

The central city has approved the 'smart' health care development project in 2025-30, promising all hospitals and health care centres we go digital in procedures, examinations and treatments.

The city said the project will be receiving total fund of VNĐ488.95 billion (US$19.56 million) for building data and infrastructure.

By 2025, all hospitals and health centres will be using digital medical records and cashless payment, offering online medical check-ups and examinations and medical consultancy or using database of patients and national database-connected ID cards.

The 'smart' health system will provide facilities for doctors giving medical consultancy to patients with online medical examination and treatment.

It also includes global positioning system (GPS) tracking of ambulances for doctors providing first aid instructions on the way to hospital.

Deputy director of the city's health department Võ Thu Tùng said the city's health data will be connected with the national health data centre, supporting doctors with patient's medical records nationwide.

The 'smart' health care system would start using AI Robot in treatment and examination in 2030 as well as medical training, he said.

Tùng said doctors will use digital images or online photos instead of checking films in examination of patients.

Last year, the city put into operation the first Intelligent Operation Centre (IOC), starting the first service of the 'smart' city plan, allowing local people and businesses to apply for paperwork from home via the city's online public one-stop service.

The system has helped speed up the procedure schedule, saving $44.2 million and cutting 20 per cent of other costs in manpower payment.

A total fund of VNĐ2.14 trillion ($95 million) has been allocated for the 'smart' city plan in 2030-45, in which information technology and communication will play a key role in the digitalisation process.

The central hub has targeted becoming the first in Việt Nam to join the ASEAN 'smart' city network by 2030.

A report from the city's information and communication department said 16 health centres and hospitals have been using digital records

Đà Nẵng, in co-operation with the military-owned telecommunications group Viettel, and FPT Group have been jointly developing a 5G network, an Internet of Things (IoT) service, a digital database centre, cyber security services and digital transforming.

Việt Nam-Denmark cooperate for a sustainable agriculture

The Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jacob Jensen, is leading a high-level delegation to visit Việt Nam on 14-16 May 2024.

Together with a group of Danish agri-food companies with advanced technology and know-how on sustainability and green transition, the aim of the minister's visit is to intensify high-level policy dialogue with Vietnamese counterparts with a focus on a more sustainable food production and a resource efficient supply chain.

Việt Nam and Denmark have developed a close and long- term bilateral relation on food safety. Since 2017, the bilateral cooperation has concentrated on facilitating co-operation within feed and food safety. The co-operation is a crucial part of the Green Strategic Partnership launched by the two Prime Ministers last November, where the two countries have committed to promote green transition and green growth, supporting Việt Nam in building a green economy and fulfilling the country's commitment to achieve net-zero emission by 2050.

The SSC Food programme between Việt Nam and Denmark has been implemented by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) and the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). The first phase of the programme focused on improving framework conditions for animal feed production through capacity development of government officials and on the legislative framework for prudent use of veterinary drugs. In phase 2, which ran from April 2020 to April 2024, the main themes of cooperation are enhancing capacity across various stages of the food chain from farm to fork, combating anti-microbial resistance (AMR), feed control and traceability and recall of unsafe food.

During his visit, Minister Jensen has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Vietnamese Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) Lê Minh Hoan extending the government-to-government co-operation. For the coming years, the co-operation will have increased focus on the green transition of food and agricultural production, aiming to promote a more sustainable and resilient food system.

Jensen said: ""Denmark's green transition in sustainable food production has led to the development of strong, innovative methods and approaches throughout the value chain, which boost production yield and improve product quality but at the same time consume less water and energy.

""We look forward to sharing these insights and inspire further collaboration with our Vietnamese partners. Our agreement is a strong testament to our fruitful cooperation where the two ministries do not only share common needs and interests but more importantly a common goal and vision: a sustainable and resilient food system.""

During his visit, the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries also made a keynote speech at a workshop on Antimicrobial Resistance in agriculture and aquaculture. Antimicrobial resistance is a big threat to public health and human health nowadays. Therefore, this has been an important track of the Strategic Sector Co-operation Food programme.

The minister's visit to Việt Nam this time, the second Danish high-level visit within just two months, has been also accompanied by a group of Danish companies and producers who own world leading's solutions in food production and processing, storages, optimising the use of food and agriculture resources, drainage and water techniques.

Việt Nam is an attractive destination for Danish businesses in the agricultural sector. At present, Denmark has been one of the EU countries with the highest export per capita to Việt Nam and the agri-food sector constitutes approximately half of the total Danish exports to Việt Nam.

""Việt Nam has become an important and attractive market for Danish businesses and investors,"" Jensen said.

""Although Việt Nam and Denmark are geographically very far from each other, we are facing many of the same challenges and we have to continue working together to find ways to use resources effectively. In a smart way to increase competitiveness and sustainability.""

During his visit in the South of Việt Nam, the minister will visit Food Bank Vietnam, an important partner for the efforts to combat food waste and food loss. He will also pay site visits to a catfish aqua-farm in Tiền Giang and an aqua-feed factory in Bến Tre, where close partnerships between Vietnamese and Danish research institutions and companies promotes the use of new green technologies and solutions for a sustainable aquaculture production in Việt Nam.

On his last day of the visit, he will deliver a keynote speech at the seminar on ""Sustainable agri-food production - Danish innovative technologies and financing opportunities"". The seminar will provide a forum to connect and facilitate exchange of experiences, technologies, financing and business opportunities between authorities, local decision-makers, sector managers as well as Danish and Vietnamese entrepreneurs.

20-year-old woman arrested for running fraudulent charity scheme

A 20-year-old woman from Cà Mau Province has been arrested for allegedly operating a fraudulent charity scheme using fake social media accounts.

Huỳnh Phương Thủy was nabbed in Đồng Nai Province by the Đồng Tháp Province police on Thursday.

She admitted to using multiple fake Facebook accounts with different names to solicit donations.

She would post in various groups, claiming to be raising funds for charitable causes but pocketed all the money, she said.

She collected VNĐ140 million and used the money for her personal expenses, according to investigators.

Đồng Tháp authorities have recently found several cases involving fake charity appeals on social media.

The police recommend that people should verify the legitimacy of donation requests to avoid scams.

Basket, brocade weaving of S'tiêng people recognised as National Intangible Cultural Heritage

Basket weaving and brocade weaving of the S'tiêng people has been included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism in 2023 and 2024.

Bình Phước Province Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism on May 15 held a ceremony at Bù Gia Mập National Park to announce the inclusion of the traditional crafts of basket weaving and brocade weaving of the S'tiêng people in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

Bình Phước is known as a region where many ethnic groups live together. Among them, the S'tiêng people are the second-largest ethnic group in the province, with nearly 97,000 people residing in 11 districts, towns, and cities of the province.

With this population size and long history, the S'tiêng community has created its own unique and distinctive cultural identity, including the traditional crafts of basket weaving and brocade weaving.

The basket weaving and brocade weaving crafts of the S'tiêng people are traditional crafts accumulated and developed over many generations, demonstrating the skill and creativity of S'tiêng artisans.

To create baskets and brocade products, the artisans must have talent, skills, and a thorough understanding of techniques.

Additionally, they must know how to identify and properly exploit natural materials such as tree leaves and bark to create dyeing materials and weaving patterns.

These techniques and knowledge reflect the accumulation, creativity, and refinement over time to produce unique products of the S'tiêng people in Bình Phước Province.

At the announcement ceremony, Nguyễn Khắc Vĩnh, deputy director of the Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of Bình Phước Province, said that the inclusion of the basket weaving and brocade weaving crafts of the S'tiêng people in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list not only honours the historical and cultural values of these traditional crafts but also recognises the efforts of local authorities and the dedication of the S'tiêng artisans and community in preserving and promoting the value of these crafts.

Vĩnh suggested that relevant authorities should continue protecting and promoting the intangible cultural heritage value of basket weaving and brocade weaving.

The provincial museum should continue researching and collecting more information to clarify the value and significance of these crafts, providing documentation and guidance to local communities, which are the heritage bearers, to effectively preserve and promote the cultural heritage.

Localities should promote traditional craft training, improve skills, create high-quality products rich in cultural identity, prioritise access to funding for households maintaining the craft to expand and develop production.

Policies should encourage and support skilled basket weavers and brocade weavers, establish craft villages as community tourism sites and form basket weaving and brocade weaving cooperatives to promote and introduce products to a broader audience of tourists.

BUDAPEST, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto stressed on Friday the importance of his country's alliance with Serbia amid heightened regional tensions.

Szijjarto, at a joint press conference in Budapest with his visiting Serbian counterpart, Marko Djuric, highlighted the development of bilateral ties in recent years, citing Serbia's grant of extensive rights to the Hungarian national minority in Vojvodina, as well as Hungary's reliance on natural gas from Serbia.

The two countries, plus Slovenia, have established a joint regional electricity exchange, which has enhanced supply and mitigated price rises.

Plans are also underway to build an oil pipeline connecting Hungary and Serbia, as well as Europe's most modern border crossing in the Roszke region. A railway line linking Budapest and Belgrade is expected to be completed by the end of next year.

Hungary is preparing for its upcoming presidency of the European Union (EU), during which it aims to advance Serbia's EU membership bid by opening the third chapter of accession negotiations, Szijjarto said.

He also announced Hungary's intention to vote against a UN General Assembly resolution that aims to ""demonize the entire Serbian nation"" in connection with the Srebrenica tragedy.

Hungary will also oppose Kosovo's membership application to the Council of Europe, advocating for the success of the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue before any application to international organizations, according to the top diplomat.

Djuric praised Hungary's achievements in defending its national interests and economic growth, which serve as an inspiration for Serbia.

He also conveyed a message from President Aleksandar Vucic, affirming that Serbia will not forget Hungary's friendship and support, and underlined the importance of the exemplary minority rights enjoyed by the Serbian community in Hungary.

The cheaper green electricity it generates satisfies the demand of more than 100,000 households in the country.

The green project, developed by China's Norinco International Cooperation Ltd., is a ""model of cooperation"" that benefits both countries, said Senj Mayor Jurica Tomljanovic. The revenue from its operation has been used to invest in infrastructure, water supply, sewerage, beaches and ""everything important for the residents"" in the city.

A beacon of the successful collaboration between China and Croatia, the wind farm also epitomizes the trend in recent years that the cooperation between China and European countries boasts great potential, particularly in green energy development. WIN-WIN GREEN COOPERATION

As Chinese battery producer CATL announced the decision to build its second European battery plant in Hungary in 2022, the two countries have witnessed increasing cooperation in advancing many green projects. Chinese carmaker BYD also decided to invest in a production base for its electric vehicles (EVs) in the European country.

Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy regarded the investment that came along with the rise of China's EV industry as an opportunity. By welcoming Chinese companies, Hungary has become a hub for electric car and battery manufacturing.

Cooperation with China is not only beneficial to Hungary, but also to the EU as a whole, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

The BYD plant will boost Europe's green transformation and improve the wellbeing of local people. Moreover, healthy competition with Chinese companies has also promoted innovation and R&D by European companies, said Kiszelly.

The entry of Arcfox, the EV brand of Chinese giant automaker Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation, into the European market through Spain last week made another significant mark in China-Europe energy cooperation.

In collaboration with Spanish Atium Logistic Group, Arcfox has established a logistics center for vehicle storage, deposit, and exportation at the port of Ferrol in northwest Spain. The center will cover a storage area of 9,000 square meters. By 2025, the Chinese firm expects sales of 5,000-8,000 units in the European market.

""This is an initiative with a long-term vision that promotes Ferrol's prominence on the map of global logistics and, of course, of China, which could be a magnet for new investments,"" said Francisco Barea, president of the Port Authority of Ferrol.

In the northeastern Spanish city of Barcelona, a new pact signed in April between Spain's Ebro-EV Motors and China's Chery Automobile will not only turn the city into an EV production center but also deliver benefits to its residents.

The joint venture created by the pact will re-employ some 1,250 former auto manufacturing workers, who lost their jobs in 2021 when Nissan closed its Barcelona plant.

Rosa Maria Jimenez was one of them. ""For such a large and important company in China as Chery to come here means that we'll be able to continue doing what we know best, which is making cars,"" Jimenez told Xinhua.

""This is going to create many jobs and not only for the workers in the company itself but all those jobs around that are connected to a car manufacturer,"" Jimenez added. The joint venture is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles a year in the Zona Franca port area. HIGHLY ANTICIPATED

The China-Europe cooperation in the green sector is poised to lead to more significant advancements in the global drive for sustainability.

Committed to providing high-quality products in coping with climate change, the Chinese new energy sector has contributed remarkably to the green transformation of countries worldwide, not least the EU members, said China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong in April.

As manufacturing powerhouses, China and Germany are reinforcing collaboration in emerging sectors, including EVs and other green transformations. A growing number of Chinese enterprises are seizing new opportunities in Europe's largest economy by joining hands with local partners. A report by the Germany Trade & Invest earlier this week showed the country's foreign direct investment projects from China in 2023 surged by 42 percent year-on-year.

According to the report, one-fifth of investment projects by Chinese companies went to Germany's renewable energy sector, tripling the number in 2022. The increasing global engagement of Chinese firms has benefited Germany, as their investments have contributed to Germany's goal of achieving climate-neutral production by 2045, said Thomas Bozoyan, author of the report.

""China and Germany could be important partners in the global climate goals, which can only be achieved together. We would welcome Chinese companies coming to Germany and producing here,"" Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday. She noted the rapid ramp-up of the Chinese EV market has benefited the European country technologically.

In April, Zhu Jing, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Mission to the EU, also highlighted the strong consensus between China and Europe on green and low-carbon development at a tech forum held in Brussels. He emphasized eco-friendly cooperation between the two parties, pointing to substantial opportunities for collaboration in technology research and development, standardization, and industrial development.

""The pressing challenges of climate change entails enhanced green cooperation between China and the EU, which will not only expedite their green transformation but also contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Zhu said. OVERCAPACITY FALLACY

However, given the rise of China's EVs, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, as well as its promising green cooperation with the globe, some American politicians and media have employed the rhetoric of China's overcapacity in new energy industry.

Experts and officials from countries and international organizations refuted this fallacy and pointed out that politicizing China's new energy industry out of conservative protectionism to curb its development momentum shows no good signs for the global consensus and trend towards green and low-carbon pursuits, or for the burgeoning development of electric vehicles worldwide.

""The fact that buyers still desire Chinese EVs suggests that the global market is not saturated yet and the assertion of overcapacity in China may be misplaced,"" said Eunice Kamwendo, a senior official from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

Mueller also regarded the claim as ""questionable"", saying that ""the Chinese numbers do not speak for it.""

The German auto association chief said that around 16 percent of the cars produced in China are exported, while the German car industry has higher export figures, with three out of every four produced cars exported. ""We are not the right people to complain about overcapacity,"" instead, fair competition should be embraced globally and that is good for all parties, she emphasized.

Against the background of huge demand for new energy in the world, China's production capacity advantages have played an important role in promoting the globe's carbon-neutral goal. The green cooperation with China taking place in multiple European countries naturally dispels the unfounded claim.

From a global perspective, overcapacity in EVs is not happening, said Wu Kegang, a former China adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce. He suggested that more Chinese companies should consider deepening cooperation and building EV manufacturing closer to the UK and EU markets.

As to reducing global carbon emissions, Carl Fey, a professor of strategy at BI Norwegian Business School, told Xinhua, ""The Chinese government deserves a lot of credit for early recognizing and believing that electric vehicles could be a solution.""

In the short term, it's good that the Chinese companies produce more ""good quality, affordable electric cars from several manufacturers"" to the world; in the long run, it's also good that the European and U.S. vehicle-makers can compete in the global arena, Fey said.

""China has done a lot to help the world move towards a green future. And that is encouraging,"" he added.

Conference Call Participants

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's earnings call of VERBIO SE following the publication of the 9 months and Q3 figures of 2023, 2024. We are delighted to welcome the CEO, Claus Sauter and the CFO, Olaf Troeber, who will speak shortly and guide us through the presentation and the results. Afterwards, we will move over to our Q&A session in which you will be allowed to ask your questions directly to them. And having said this, Mr. Sauter, I hand over to you.

Claus Sauter

Thank you very much, Mrs. Malok. Good afternoon or in my case, good morning, and thank you very much for joining today's earnings call. With me on this call today is Olaf Troeber, our CFO. At the moment, I am in the United States in our headquarter in Stamford, Connecticut.

We are making good progress here in South Bend, in Nevada, the ethanol plants as well as in Valent and also in Europe. Our strategy remains steadfast, even in the dynamic renewable market. We are now 10, almost 11 months in our financial year. And as we had anticipated with our guidance cut in January for the actual financial year. The market in renewables was more challenging in the third quarter.

But let me first give you a quick run through of our key figures for the first 9 months. So as you can see, in good VERBIO fashion, we continue to deliver strong production volumes, increasing our production across all key products. The biodiesel volume increased year-on-year was mainly driven by the acquisition of South Bend ethanol in the U.S., the plant which we bought in May 2023, and what we ramped up the last month. So at South Bend, ethanol, we have managed to increase our production about the nominal capacity, which represents a 30% increase from just a few months ago. So we did technical changes, but mainly operational changes.

So despite the increase in volumes, group EBITDA for the 9 months, 2023, 2024, reached EUR 82 million, down year-on-year from EUR 214 million. The main reason remain largely unchanged from what we have seen for the first 6 months. So let me quickly reiterate. In the financial year 2022, 2023, we still benefited from the exceptional contribution of the biodiesel segment. We made more than EUR 90 million in the first quarter alone with our biodiesel.

Meanwhile, we are getting up for further growth, which led to additional fixed costs year-on-year. Considering that our European operations still have to cover all growth investments and that we are facing short-term headwinds in the European biofuel market, the results are largely within our own expectations. Net debt stands at EUR 55 million, especially our investments in growth projects of close to EUR 130 million weighed against our positive operating cash flow. Still, our equity ratio is at a level of 68.4% came down slightly. And now I would like to hand over to Olaf Troeber, our CFO.

Olaf Troeber

Thank you, Claus, and a warm welcome also from my end. I'm here today a bit of help where we hold our crown frigging ceremony for the Ethanol Schwedt plant. But first, let me turn to our Q3 results before we dive deeper into our strategic update. The chart shows the EBITDA bridge from Q3 '22, '23 to Q3 '23-'24 left to right and gives you an overview of how both segments have developed. Once again, the biodiesel segment safeguards our earnings as ethanol segment covers all the costs related to the U.S.

expansion. The decline in the biodiesel segment year-over-year is mostly due to unrealized changes in the fair value of open commodity derivatives. Excluding this effect, the biodiesel segment result would have stood at EUR 21.1 million, close to the level in the previous year. Overall, we posted an EBITDA of EUR 7.3 million in Q3, '23, '24, down from EUR 43.2 million in Q2 last year and from EUR 26.1 million sequentially, but let us dive a bit deeper and look at the key drivers. While our sales volumes were roughly stable year-over-year, sales came down by 29% year-over-year.

The main reason for the sales development in biodiesel segment, where the lower biodiesel and greenhouse gas quota sales prices in Europe compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Additionally, changes in the presentation of the sales revenues in Canada led to a significant reduction in revenues. What does it mean? Since December 23, the contracts for the production volumes in Canada are treated as storing contracts. The change in reporting has no impact on our EBITDA.

However, the unrealized changes in fair value of open commodity 2. As you know, we only opportunistically choose to hedge and considering that Q4 forward spread stood at attractive levels, and we are operating in volatile markets, we decided to take a position. Including the effect our Q3 reported EBITDA came in at EUR 11.44 million. This chart, you can see how the market spreads in this case, biodiesel price per ton minus rapeseed oil price per ton have developed over the past 2 years and specifically during our Q3. This year's market spreads shown as the dark green line, were below previous year spreads but remained roughly stable throughout the quarter.

Considering that we buy our rapeseed oil approximately 2 to 3 months in advance we couldn't lock into spreads in financial year '22, '23. Over the first quarter of the year 2024, which is our third quarter, biodiesel prices and rapeseed oil prices increased slightly. While demand was stable, biodiesel prices increased on the back of higher raw material prices and pricing fossil markets. Now moving to the ethanol and biomethane or RNG segment. Production and sales volumes increased mainly thanks to the acquisition of South Bend Ethanol in May last year, where we greatly advanced in terms of efficiency, as Claus mentioned before.

With this, revenues were up despite lower sales prices in Europe. Grain prices came also down but the lower greenhouse gas premiums in the contracts that started in January 2024, had a negative effect on overall margins. On top came of course, U.S. expansion costs. And last year, we earned about EUR 10 million more by additional quota sales compared to Q3 this year.

Overall, we returned a negative EUR 5 million EBITDA, which includes a positive effect from unrealized commodity futures. As you might be able to identify from the chart, the average quarterly market spreads were roughly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. During the quarter, spreads increased. And here in the chart on the right, you can see why. Ethanol prices recovered while prices continued a downward trend.

Reduced imports in particular from Brazil led to a reduction in ethanol stocks in water dam from 2023 due to increased blending mandates and the introduction of E10 in Poland and elsewhere. There was healthy demand for spot quantities. The ongoing backwardation is making ethanol imports more difficult and should contribute to a positive price trend. In Germany, however, the low greenhouse gas quota prices continue to slow the E10 growth. The incentive will expand the market share of fuels with a higher proportion of biofuels remains limited in the short term.

Yet the ongoing antidumping investigations at the European level as well as the media attention, in particular, with regard to cases of fraud involving upstream emission reductors allow us to stay optimistic that missing control mechanism will be installed and that we will return to fair market conditions in the future. Claus will now give you an update on that and share the latest news.

Claus Sauter

Thank you, Olaf. Yes, to come back to Main to fair market condition in short future, in short term. So now you can see on that slide the development of the quota prices. So quota prices remain under pressure. But again, we see a new story of Chinese proud.

So the new story is UER. First of all, what we can see on the chart is that from January 23, the quota prices came down from EUR 400 per metric ton of 100, 120. And I think what we can see here on the chart is that we found the ground makes sense because on this level with EUR 100 million, EUR 120, EUR 150 per metric ton of CO2 savings, even the proud of from China, labeling as advanced biofuel doesn't make sense. But what is now about UER. So UER is upstream emission reduction.

There were a few reports recently on television, in newspapers. And upstream emission reduction is another option to meet German regulation on greenhouse gas reduction. It was implemented in 2020. And it is limited to up 1.2% maximum. So for example, if there is a greenhouse gas reduction quota of 10% from this 10%, 1.2% can be fulfilled by upstream emission reduction, which means 8.8% have to be done by biofuels or renewable electricity.

So it is significant. We are talking about 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 savings per year coming from UER. And UER, for example, is greenhouse gas reduction measurement at oil rigs, at gas rigs. So everywhere in the world where emissions coming from fossil crude and fossil gas upstream, all the measurements, which take place to reduce this emission accounting for greenhouse gas reduction in Germany and several other European countries, not all of them. So what came out is that with this UER project, we're already 95% are located in China that there is similar frauds like with imports of fate biodiesel.

So it turns out that at least 10 projects are not existing or not eligible. So some of these projects are simply not existing. They are not there, even though they have been certified. And the place of certification is the Deutsche Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, which is part of Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt. And because fraud could easily be demonstrated.

The German government quickly presented an amendment to the 36 Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz. So the draft and the accounting of upstream emission reduction certificates towards the greenhouse gas quota in 2024. But this is 2 years earlier than originally planned. And at least what makes me happy is that this is the first time that the German government related to Chinese proud is really reacting fast. So the announcement resulted in a small jump in greenhouse gas quota prices from the lows.

But let me go through this specific implication on the following slide. So I mentioned that UER were firstly implemented in 2020. So in 2020, the greenhouse gas reduction quota was 6%. And from the 6%, 1.2% where UER. So at least coming from 2019, where the greenhouse gas quota was 4% to 2020 with 6%, but with UER, the increase at least was just 1% from 2019 to 2020.

So if we compare now and look on the chart, so the chart shows the yearly growth in market size of greenhouse gas savings in biofuel and e-mobility. So without the UER, only biofuels and e-mobility. So that we can see in 2020, it even came down, the use of biofuels minus 0.2%, and then it went up again in 2022 by 1.9% and in 2023 by 2%. So that is the logic behind that chart. And since the introduction of the greenhouse gas quota in 2015.

The sad increase of 1.25% plus the elimination of the UER as a compliance option leads to the highest ever increase of about 5 million tonnes of CO2 savings year-on-year. So without upstream emission reduction disappearing at the end of 2024, the demand for liquid biofuels and e-mobility. The greenhouse gas reduction, which has to come from that part will increase to approximately about or even more than 5 million tonnes. This is huge. So this adds up to a total market size of renewable fuels of more than 21 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

So altogether, this means that the cushion of the CO2 savings that oil majors have on their balance sheets should deteriorate, eventually leading to a buying spree and supporting prices again. On top comes the decline in Chinese import. This provides additional upside for all other renewable fuels and e-mobility market players and is fueled by the EU antidumping investigation. So taking into consideration less imports from China from advanced biofuels, investigation from the EU capped with no more UER and the further increase in obligation in 2025 should create a significant higher demand for biofuels and greenhouse gas reduction in 2025. What about the investigation?

So for now, there is no retroactive cancellation of a quota plant, but the industry, of course, and our associations are still fighting for. So as we have received particular interest from shareholders who want to support the fight against green product fraud. We or Alina have added a few sources in the appendix. So you can refer to those links after the call if you are interested. So I think VERBIO was one of the first companies who pointed out very strong on that route already 1, 1.5 years ago.

Now it is everywhere. It appeared everywhere in Europe, the European Commission politicians recognized that high greenhouse gas targets and an open market without control will not work. So now let's switch over to the, I guess, it is the last slide about our guidance. So guidance remained unchanged, specified to the lower end. So turning out to our guidance.

Our guidance, which was updated in January for the current financial year remains unchanged. As of now, we expect or we do expect to come in at the lower end of the EBITDA guidance based on the current market environment. This still translates into a very strong increase in EBITDA in Q4 year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So aside from better spread in biodiesel, which we can only partially capture due to some hedged volumes. This is specifically driven by the better performance of South Bend Ethanol.

On top come biodiesel production volumes with higher CO2 efficiency as we have successfully commissioned our advanced biodiesel capacity in suite. With this, we are doubling our total second-generation biodiesel production capacities to 100,000 tonnes. So at least these are the results of our investment program in Europe, what we started about 2 years ago. So having said that, let me turn to our strategic update. So at Nevada, the production of renewable natural gas was already successfully commissioned in March and is currently running at about the capacity of 30%.

The next step is to start up the ethanol production. Right now, we are working on it, and the plan is to have the first significant volumes of ethanol by the end of May. So as you can probably tell, this means that we were able to repair the sulfur separate container. There's a lot of small stuff had to be eliminated the last month, but our team made there a very good job. So full capacity utilization of the biorefinery in Nevada is expected in 6 to 9 months from now.

Furthermore, the biomethane plant is eligible for an investment tax credit regarding the IRA in the inflation reduction of 30% of the investment cost, but it is only the part of the RNG plant, not the ethanol part. So right now, VERBIO North America is currently in final negotiations to sell the ITC in the amount of about USD 40 million, and we want to complete the process before the end of the current financial year. Honestly, I'm surprised how easy it works to create the ITC and to find a customer who is interested in buying an ITC. We have to give a discount here higher single percentage. So not a big deal and compared with the actual inflation rate, it is really moderate.

But that is a very interesting experience for me how the United States are financing their investments in renewables. Knowing that now, I think Germany could learn a lot from this system. So the rules are simple, and the market works transferring tax credit to other companies. So to come back to Nevada, specifically, so the near-term start of the full commercial production at the refinery in Nevada as well as the advancement at South Bend Ethanol means that we are ready for the next step. And the next step is we will begin the expansion into a combined bioethanol and biomethane production in South Bend.

So the official groundbreaking with some politicians is scheduled for May 23. So May is an interesting and successful month in the business year 2024. So let me now hand back to Olaf, who will give you an update on our European activities, Olaf, please take over.

Olaf Troeber

Well, thanks. Speaking of groundbreaking ceremonies. As I said at the beginning of the call, the crown freaking ceremonies for the Ichnusa Plant is actually happening today, I think in half an hour or so. So let me sum up at the project specifics for you again. We are doubling down on the chemical sector to gain a foothold in the world, third largest industry.

The challenges for green chemistry are enormous. Green chemistry is not just a question of environmental protection. It's also an economic necessity after all, markets are changing and consumers, the public and legacy laters are increasingly demanding and environmentally friendly products. Now since 2019, we have been operating a pilot plant in Hungary in which we produce centers, with very small volumes. We are constantly optimizing this innovative process there.

Now, we are taking the next steps. We are investing in the world's first Ichnusa Plant on an industrial scale. What does it mean in figures? VERBIO is investing a total of EUR 80 million to EUR 100 million in the new Ichnusa plant at a better health side, and we will be receiving a double-digit investment trend of approximately 20%. The nominal capacity of our plant will be at 32,000 tonnes per year of 9 Dame and the 17,000 tonnes per year of Deca.

We plan to produce a total of 60,000 tons per year of renewable product for the chemical industry at the plant. The aim is to commission Ichnusa plant next year in 2025. We would then like to start regular production the following year in 2026. And with this, we would like to conclude today's prepared remarks and start the Q&A session. Thanks.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you so much for your presentation. Mr. Sauter and Mr. Troeber. And now we will move over to our Q&A session.

For a dynamic conversation, we appreciate if you could ask your questions in person by audio line. [Operator Instructions]. And we will start with the questions from Niklas Becker. So please go ahead and ask your questions.

Niklas Becker

Yes. It's Nicholas from Deutsche Bank. Thanks for the call, and thank you very much for the update, especially on the Chinese biodiesel flows in combination with the German Greenreenhouse gas quota. I have one question regarding the quota prices. Is the market still as illiquid as it was back in the second quarter?

And where do you see the greenhouse gas quota prices progressing to in 2025?

Claus Sauter

Yes, interesting question. Well, if you are dealing with pure greenhouse gas quotas, there are just a few players and the market is illiquid. But you know that most of our greenhouse gas savings we are placing in the market linked with our liquid molecules. So the second part, where we see the quota prices we don't know yet how much greenhouse gas savings, the oil companies really have on their books. We estimate something between 6 million and 7 million tonnes, which is a lot compared with 2023 obligation.

But with going UER, less imports from China, I think I mentioned it during the call, these amounts are going to the period fastly. So we think that a healthy CO2 price must be in the area of about EUR 250 per metric ton of CO2 savings. This is something where additional investments and additional investments in more production capacities are needed, especially heading into 2030 because the curve of obligation is a hockey stick and is very much increasing in 2026, 2027, '28, '29. So at the end of the curve, we need additional investments, and therefore, we, as VERBIO say, we need CO2 prices of about EUR 250 per metric tone. And on that level, it will attract additional and necessary investments in new capacity.

But if we will reach already in 2025 or in 2026, that level of 250 million. This we don't know, and it is very much dependent on the amount of CO2 savings oil companies are having on their book.

Niklas Becker

That's very helpful. Maybe a question attached to that. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that it is economically not attractive for Chinese biodiesel to continue flowing into the European Union at these greenhouse gas quota prices. Could you just elaborate on the reasoning behind that? Because my understanding is that we still have seen substantial volumes in the first quarter of 2024 flowing from China into the European Union.

Claus Sauter

Yes, we see imports, but this is nothing compared to what we saw 1 year ago. So it came now down to a more reasonable level. But if you are creating the double amount of CO2 savings, and if we are right and most of it is coming from Proud, then what are the 2 effects. The first effect is that palm oil is about $100 per metric ton 150 depends on the market situation, cheaper than rapeseed oil. And on the other side, you have higher logistic costs.

So logistic cost is it has to come from Indonesia to China, go through a tank, go on the boat again, go to Europe, come in. So if you just get for your CO2 savings, EUR 100 or EUR 120 per metric ton, then you are close that this additional money will not cover your cost anymore. And because of this, I say, it was attractive when the CO2 saving was at EUR 400 per metric ton because you make about 5 tonnes of CO2 savings with double counting on 1 ton of biodiesel. So that was about if we talk about EUR 400, we were about EUR 2,000 additional money per metric ton just from the greenhouse gas savings. And now if we are talking about EUR 120 million, it's just EUR 600 million.

And on the other side, you have to deduct your additional cost. So with EUR 400 per metric tonic was much more attractive also to accept the additional logistic costs at 120, it doesn't make so much then anymore. Understood.

Niklas Becker

Yes. That's very clear. And then one last question before I go back into the queue on your hedging in the biodiesel segment. Can you provide a little more color on the hedging initiatives. And specifically, I'm looking for how much of your biodiesel sales volumes in the fourth quarter you have secured and also at what prices, i.e., what kind of EBITDA tailwind can we expect from those hedges in the fourth quarter, given you should have visibility on your rapeseed oil prices you have locked in already?

Claus Sauter

Okay. I think these numbers, the detailed numbers, Olaf will provide just about the strategy behind. Well, the last few calls, we were always talking about the uncertainty in Europe, what is coming from China. So we saw reasonable margins coming in especially for rapeseed oil-based biodiesel, and that was one point where we said, okay, let's do some hedging. Numbers will come now from Olaf.

And it's a little bit ironical. I said the margins were good for rapeseed biodiesel, we were surprised about that. But most of the imports which are coming from China, are off spec. So they don't fulfill the spec, the specification. The best biodiesel in the market is biodiesel from rapeseed oil and especially from VERBIO because most of our product is distilled.

So the market needs biodiesel from rapeseed oil, high-quality product to blend the off-spec import from China. So it's a little bit ironical that especially the first generation biodiesel biodiesel made from rapeseed oil is taking advantage about it. So Olaf, could you provide more details about Q4?

Olaf Troeber

Yes. Regarding the biodiesel, we hedged close to 50% of our European production in Q4. And the reason we disclosed already, it's simply to shield us a little bit against the higher expected volatility within the market. Regarding the prices, we achieved a good margin and good means healthy and good enough that we expect to reach the lower end of our financial year '23, '24 guidance. And just to give you a little bit more color, we had a negative volume value of these derivative of a little bit more.

I think it was EUR 11 million. So I mean that's a result that is already given in the fourth quarter. And that means, in turn, we have to achieve a little bit less than a EUR 10 million EBITDA in each month in the fourth quarter, which should be achievable. And that's also the reason why we said we will come in at the lower end of our guidance.

Niklas Becker

Sorry, just to confirm, the lower end of your guidance, does this only assume contribution from biodiesel? Or are you also counting on your ethanol segment, too?

Olaf Troeber

Yes. Also from a certain contribution from the ethanol segment is needed to achieve the lower end, the EUR 120 million for the entire financial year. But right now, we see quite good margins, not very healthy, but good margins. The ethanol price stands approximately at EUR 680, EUR 690 per cubic. And we also already locked in the raw material prices for most of the needs for Q4 of this financial year.

So there is a good visibility. You never know it's commodity markets with a high volatility, but it's a good visibility right now.

Claus Sauter

Yes. And we are quite sure now also with ethanol. The arbitrage for import volumes to Brazil and to the United States are for single counting, ethanol are closed at the level what Olaf mentioned, EUR 690 EUR 700 per cubic meter. On the other side, what I can report here from the U.S. is we had, and I mentioned it during our presentation, we made significant progress in South Bend.

We increased the production volumes by 30%. And that means that the whole economics is changing, you have more volumes with the same amount of fixed costs. So that means the contribution, the negative contribution to our ethanol segment in the last quarters are going down. So U.S. is still not profitable, but we are heading now into reducing costs.

And saying that means our European ethanol business was never negative. It was always profitable, but the costs of increasing the capacities in the United States and all these investment projects are covered in our ethanol and RNG segment. So ethanol and RNG European production has to cover all the costs. So that is the reason. So what Olaf said, for the last quarter, better and stable margins in Europe, something we locked already in, what he referred to.

And on the other side, reduction of cost contribution for the U.S. expansion. And I would say, yes, we are through the valley. Now we are able to increase our profitability and with all the arguments and the facts around higher quotas in 2025, we are very positive that we can come back to real and attractive profitability. So now, somebody else should come in and ask questions.

Niklas, thank you very much. But some more questions from other parties.

Operator

Absolutely. So we now move over to the questions from Adrian Pehl.

Adrian Pehl

So first one because we just had the floor of discussing that regarding hedging. Just to be clear on what you did. So is it basically hedging on the input side, so being rapeseed in wheat? Or are you also hedging the appetite, that's my first question. The second one is, I'm still wondering if, I mean, obviously, you had negative EBITDA contributions from hedging.

And on the other hand, is it fair to assume that if you had not done that, your guidance would rather look for, let's say, the midpoint. I mean, on the other hand, you're probably sacrificing some stability in Q4. But any thoughts and clarification on that would be helpful.

Claus Sauter

Okay. Second question, first, you are right. Without hedging, it would be even better. But Olaf mentioned it, we didn't hedge all the volumes. We hedged half of it.

But anyway, margins became even better. That is the reason why the hedging position at the end of March was negative with minus 11%. But you saw also that the margins came back. So that's also the hedging, there for Q4 is now on a more positive side. But you are right, without hedging, we would be closer to the middle of our guidance than on the lower end, but [foreign language].

Okay. So second, input. How is the hedging? When we talk about hedging, then we talk about sales hedging because usually, our input is priced at a fixed price. So that means the wheat or the, let's say, serial, not wheat, the cereals, because it's a bunch of different cereals, the cereals for ethanol production are bought fixed, and we don't need additional amounts now until the new harvest 2024.

So with cereals, we are more or less done. The same with the rapeseed oil. And then on the sales side, we did the hedging to secure our sales prices. On biodiesel and yes, on ethanol, we are doing more or less the same through our trading department. So everything there is on a healthy way.

Adrian Pehl

And actually, the second question is, as always, we are very curious to hear the amount of biomethane that's still stored in the balance sheet because it looks to me like at first glance, not gone through everything, but you sold more biomethane in Q3. Is that correct?

Claus Sauter

Yes, it's correct.

Adrian Pehl

And do you have a number for us where we stand with the stored methane?

Claus Sauter

Well, we are not disclosing this number in detail, but you are in the right way. So I think you have a feeling. So we were selling some greenhouse gas reduction. What we have to sell amounts from 2023. And yes, we sold also more biomethane, even into different markets like transport, but we are not disclosing the volumes.

Adrian Pehl

That's unfortunate, but I'll take it as it is. The next question that I have is actually I was surprised to see actually that your headcount in the ethanol business was actually coming off a little bit from the peak that we saw in the quarter before. So what's the background for that?

Claus Sauter

Well, at the end of, so in October, November is in the United States, the season where we are harvesting the cons over. So that is a seasonal work. So we had to hire there some drug drivers and drivers for the balers. And when the season is over in our third quarter, so first quarter 2024, we released these people. So it is just this seasonal part.

On the other side, what means the team in the production, South Bend as well as Nevada, we are still hiring people. We did already a lot, but small amount. So there will be further increase on the yearly average. We are investing there in people. We saw that the former owner, especially in South Bend was running the plant really at the lower end of what is necessary really from employees and especially blue colors to run such a plant.

So our strategy is different. We are more technical driven, and Oliver with his team is now building up there a team. And I think the results are great, more or less with the same team and 30%. The last 10 years, the plant didn't make so much ethanol like we are doing now since February, and there is further space to go up. So our real target is to achieve 100 million gallon ethanol with that plant, which is about 385,000 cubic meters.

Adrian Pehl

Just 2 very quick ones. Actually, do you have the number for us actually on the production of ethanol that you had in the U.S.? And the second one is phasing on CapEx. I mean, I would assume that fourth quarter will see quite some CapEx versus the previous quarters. Is that fair to assume?

Or are you going lower on the CapEx side of things?

Claus Sauter

Okay. All right. So ethanol right now, it's just South Bend. And we are doing now close to 8 million gallons per month. So that is the actual capacity.

So the target for 2024, 2025 is 90 million gallons. The previous year before we overtook the plant was 65, EUR 65 million gallon. So I think for this business, yes, I don't have the real numbers in mind for the first 6 months of the business year, but I guess we are coming out at 75 million, 80 million gallons for the business here. The first half was [foreign language] was not sufficient. But as I said now, since February, we are doing good progress.

And I think overall, we should come out at 70%, 75%, 80% in that range. And for the next business year is 90%, let's see if we are really even able to reach the 100 million gallons. So for the CapEx, well maybe Olaf can give a more meat on the bone. But I don't expect so much CapEx now in the last quarter. Yes, we are doing groundbreaking in Bitterfeld and we are doing groundbreaking in South Bend, but that's not related to so much cost.

So the real costs are coming during 2025, when you are ordering equipment, destilations, everything like this. But Olaf, can you approve my statement?

Olaf Troeber

Yes. Actually, the plan is that we will face additional investments in Q4 of close to EUR 60 million. But based on my experience that is at the very high end of our planning. I would rather expect a EUR 40 million, EUR 45 million for the Q4 this financial year.

Adrian Pehl

Yeah, that's what I thought. So definitely below EUR 200 million for the full year, right?

Olaf Troeber

Yes. For the full year, definitely below the EUR 200 million.

Operator

Thank you, Adrian. So by now, we just have one question from the chatbox left, and we do not want to leave Camia without the answer. So the question is, does the guidance also include the sales of U.S. IRA tax credits? Or is that on top?

Olaf Troeber

Yes, it's not a contribution. It's a tax credit, and we have to write down the tax credit over the next 16 years. So it will be approximately a yearly contribution of USD 2.5 million per year EBITDA wise. But I mean, it's not just a couple of weeks left. So there won't be any kind of contribution for the current financial year.

Claus Sauter

And to come to the clear answer, yes, it is on top. It's a tax credit. It doesn't go through our P&L. It's a tax credit. Therefore, it has even a higher value than just a subsidy.

And yes, the cash comes on top. And the rest of the value of our assets, it's not impacted immediately by the tax credit. So it is really a very nice and attractive instrument to finance all the investments into renewables, very smart system here in the United States. Okay. Then I think we are done.

Operator

Yes. I guess we just come back to Nicholas with a really, really quick follow-up.

Adrian Pehl

Just one follow-up question on the ramp-up costs in Nevada. You previously expected some EUR 20 million headwinds in the current financial year. Is this still a valid assumption? And how much additional, if any, should we assume for the next financial year?

Claus Sauter

Well overall, and I think we also mentioned this, the costs for our U.S. expansion without investment was about EUR 30 million, not only 20 million, it was EUR 30 million. But South Bend is included there. So right now, we are commissioning and we start up the ramp-up phase. Olaf can give you here more information.

But the only thing that I want to say is that the full utilization due to our planning at the moment, we are expecting, let's say, during the first quarter of 2025. So we need, I mentioned this 6 to 9 months now for the ramp-up phase. Let's see if it goes faster, what is, at the moment, very helpful is that corn prices in the United States are very low. Farmers had a good harvest 2023. So corn prices came down from $8.50 per bushel to $4.50 right now, so nearly 50%, which is huge.

And that is also reducing our commissioning costs because the gas, and I mentioned it during my speech, the gas, what we are right now producing is not sold to the transport sector. It goes to the voluntary market, and this is more or less very much fixed price. So Olaf, do you have a feeling now what will be the real commissioning costs for 2025 for Nevada?

Olaf Troeber

I first would answer the past. So we are talking around the midpoint for Nevada EBITDA rise between EUR 20 million and up to EUR 30 million, so rather EUR 25 million plus/minus, EBITDA wise. For the next financial year, I mean, it's a little bit difficult. We are planning with at least a black figure let's say, plus EUR 5 million EBITDA, including South Bend. But you have to keep in mind, first, it's a ramp-up phase with the one or other uncertainty which might arise.

It's the downside. But the upside is actually that's, yes, that's not on the table right now. But with the increase of the production volumes with South Bend plus the healthier margins in the United States and the upcoming or actually the driving season. So we have also a substantial upside potential regarding the EBITDA for the next financial year coming from our U.S. ethanol operations.

But again, it's a ramp-up phase. So don't expect very, very good figures at the very beginning of the year. Yes, it's more rather a line going up. So breakeven plus 6.

Claus Sauter

And I think as Olaf mentioned it, it's a ramp-up phase. Once the production is running like we have it in Europe, we have much better visibility. So stay in contact with Alina. She will inform you, give you short-term guidance information. And I think that is really the right strategy for the next 12 months that all the analysts stay in close contact with Alina.

Operator

Thank you very much. So with this answer, yes, our Q&A session ends, and this means we come to the end of today's earnings call. So thank you, everyone, for joining in to show interest in VERBIO. Should further questions arise at a later time, please feel free to contact Investor Relations. And Mr. Sauter and Mr. Troeber, also a big thank you to you for the presentation and the time you took today. So from my side, I wish you all a lovely remaining day and hand over again to you, Mr. Sauter for some final remarks.

Claus Sauter

Yes. Nothing more to add. Thank you very much for everybody who was joining the call and contributing to the discussion and we are Olaf, me, and Alina looking forward to our next call reporting the successful final of 2023, 2024, which was a very challenging year, I had to admit Okay.

But when President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hosted Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Ankara this week, it was almost a routine talk between neighbours.

The meeting was their fourth in 10 months as the two leaders try to put an end to decades of mutual animosity by focusing on trade, tourism, energy and repairing cultural ties, among other areas.

""In the critical area of migration, the cooperation between our two countries and especially between the police and the coast guard is paying off against illegal flows and against the wretched traffickers, who take advantage of desperate people's pain,"" said Mitsotakis in a common press conference.

""This cooperation must continue and be intensified.""

There are still areas where both sides have agreed to disagree, but it's good to see one old trouble spot in Europe sort of fading, especially as another trouble spot reignited big time this week.

Thousands of protesters in Georgia rallied near the parliament building in Tbilisi - again - just hours after lawmakers gave the final approval to the controversial foreign influence law, modelled on a Russian version passed more than a decade earlier.

Lawmakers passed the law despite EU warnings that it would undermine Georgia's path to EU membership.

Yet, the official reaction in Brussels was muted.

Speaking in Denmark, EU Council President Charles Michel said: ""I had a phone call a few days ago with the Prime Minister and I told him that I am disappointed and that I sincerely hope that Georgia will find a way to stick to the democratic principles and also meet the expectations of the population.""

Meanwhile, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released its latest economic outlook. The numbers for Georgia, which is part of the area where the EBRD operates, were rather sobering.

In general, the forecast also contained some encouraging news.

To learn more, we spoke to Beata Javorcik, chief economist of the EBRD.

Euronews: So, your latest report is appropriately called ""Taming Inflation"" - and when I look at the numbers, inflation in the EBRD regions came down from a peak in October 2022 of 17.5 percent to an average of 6.3 percent last March. Explain that number for us, what is behind such a huge drop?

Javorcik: What has helped bring the inflation down was to a large extent, the developments in the international markets. We have seen a sharp drop in the prices of natural gas in Europe, declines in prices of agricultural commodities, and oil prices have remained moderate. But, of course, inflation in our regions of operations still remains above the level before the pandemic, as is the case in advanced economies.

Euronews: Can you breathe a sigh of relief now or are there still important inflation risks remaining?

Javorcik: Not all central bankers can consider their job done. If you look at cumulative inflation, that is inflation since February 2022 up until now, it has exceeded 30% in several countries. Notably in Egypt, in Turkey, in Hungary and Kazakhstan, Moldova and Ukraine. So, that means that in the absence of wage increases, people in those countries would have lost a third of their purchasing power.

Euronews: Let's talk about the growth outlook in the EBRD's EU regions - do you see positive signs going forward?

Javorcik: This year is going to be much better than last year for the Eastern European EU member states, in particular Poland and Croatia, stand out with expected growth of 3%. Hungary will do well, too. We see real wages increasing. We see fiscal policy helping out and the EU funding, the New Generation EU, also stimulating economic activity.

Euronews: I can't release you without a word on Ukraine. How is their economy doing in the third year of the war?

Javorcik: The heavy bombings in the last two months mean that the ability of Ukraine to generate electricity has been severely diminished. Electricity production is at 40% of what it used to be before the bombings. And this capacity cannot be easily repaired.

Looking for something fun to do over the weekend?

How about jumping from a helicopter at 3,000 feet high, diving down to 35 metres above the River Thames and then soaring through London's Tower Bridge only to rise up again to 80 metres, the height required to open the parachute before landing safely?

This is a complex James-Bond-like manoeuvre known among insiders as a ""flare"".

Well, two professional skydivers from Austria did it this week and described the experience as ""a dream come true"".

And this coming from veteran skydivers with more than 22,000 jumps under their belt...

From take-off to landing, the London wingsuit flight covered more than a kilometer and reached a top speed of almost 250 kilometers per hour - and it lasted 45 seconds.

(NASDAQ: BNRG), a leading developer of thermal energy storage systems, has announced a significant expansion in its project pipeline, which now includes 49 potential contracts valued at over $500 million.

These projects, which are at various stages of development, aim to deliver more than 6,000 MWh of zero-emission heat through the company's bGen™ ZERO thermal energy storage (TES) systems.

The potential contracts span 12 industries, with the food and beverage, consumer goods, energy, chemicals, and pharmaceutical sectors showing the most significant interest. Geographically, the United States, Spain, Hungary, Israel, and India are home to the largest share of these pipeline projects.

Brenmiller's bGen™ TES technology is designed to replace fossil fuel boilers in industrial and power plants, which are responsible for nearly a quarter of global emissions. The system works by storing low-cost electricity from renewable or other sustainable sources in crushed rocks and dispatching steam, hot water, or hot air as needed by customers. This technology offers a modular and highly configurable solution for industries aiming to achieve zero-emission heat while maintaining operational reliability around the clock.

Chairman and CEO Avi Brenmiller expressed optimism about the company's engagement with leading industrial and energy companies, noting that several projects are in advanced negotiation stages. Brenmiller anticipates that two to four of these projects may result in binding, revenue-generating contracts in the near future.

The bGen™ system, which has been recognized by TIME as one of the Best Inventions of 2023 in the Green Energy category, is part of Brenmiller's effort to help industries and power producers transition away from fossil fuels. The company operates the world's only gigafactory for thermal battery production and has established a reputation among multinational energy companies.

This expansion in Brenmiller Energy's project pipeline is based on a press release statement and reflects the growing demand for sustainable and renewable energy solutions across various sectors and regions.

As Brenmiller Energy (NASDAQ: BNRG) continues to make strides in expanding its project pipeline, the financial metrics and expert insights provided by InvestingPro offer a deeper understanding of the company's current market position.

With a market capitalization of just 5.05 million USD, Brenmiller Energy is a relatively small player in the energy sector, which aligns with the InvestingPro Tips that label the company as a niche player in the industry. This small size may afford the company greater agility but also comes with increased risk, especially considering the InvestingPro Tips highlighting that the company is quickly burning through cash and has weak gross profit margins.

BERLIN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Situated on the Adriatic coast of western Croatia, the Senj Wind Farm has reduced the country's carbon dioxide emissions by about 460,000 tons annually since it was inaugurated in 2021. The cheaper green electricity it generates satisfies the demand of more than 100,000 households in the country.

The green project, developed by China's Norinco International Cooperation Ltd., is a ""model of cooperation"" that benefits both countries, said Senj Mayor Jurica Tomljanovic. The revenue from its operation has been used to invest in infrastructure, water supply, sewerage, beaches and ""everything important for the residents"" in the city.

A beacon of the successful collaboration between China and Croatia, the wind farm also epitomizes the trend in recent years that the cooperation between China and European countries boasts great potential, particularly in green energy development.

As Chinese battery producer CATL announced the decision to build its second European battery plant in Hungary in 2022, the two countries have witnessed increasing cooperation in advancing many green projects. Chinese carmaker BYD also decided to invest in a production base for its electric vehicles (EVs) in the European country.

Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy regarded the investment that came along with the rise of China's EV industry as an opportunity. By welcoming Chinese companies, Hungary has become a hub for electric car and battery manufacturing.

Cooperation with China is not only beneficial to Hungary, but also to the EU as a whole, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

The BYD plant will boost Europe's green transformation and improve the wellbeing of local people. Moreover, healthy competition with Chinese companies has also promoted innovation and R&D by European companies, said Kiszelly.

The entry of Arcfox, the EV brand of Chinese giant automaker Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation, into the European market through Spain last week made another significant mark in China-Europe energy cooperation.

In collaboration with Spanish Atium Logistic Group, Arcfox has established a logistics center for vehicle storage, deposit, and exportation at the port of Ferrol in northwest Spain. The center will cover a storage area of 9,000 square meters. By 2025, the Chinese firm expects sales of 5,000-8,000 units in the European market.

""This is an initiative with a long-term vision that promotes Ferrol's prominence on the map of global logistics and, of course, of China, which could be a magnet for new investments,"" said Francisco Barea, president of the Port Authority of Ferrol.

In the northeastern Spanish city of Barcelona, a new pact signed in April between Spain's Ebro-EV Motors and China's Chery Automobile will not only turn the city into an EV production center but also deliver benefits to its residents.

The joint venture created by the pact will re-employ some 1,250 former auto manufacturing workers, who lost their jobs in 2021 when Nissan closed its Barcelona plant.

Rosa Maria Jimenez was one of them. ""For such a large and important company in China as Chery to come here means that we'll be able to continue doing what we know best, which is making cars,"" Jimenez told Xinhua.

""This is going to create many jobs and not only for the workers in the company itself but all those jobs around that are connected to a car manufacturer,"" Jimenez added. The joint venture is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles a year in the Zona Franca port area.

The China-Europe cooperation in the green sector is poised to lead to more significant advancements in the global drive for sustainability.

Committed to providing high-quality products in coping with climate change, the Chinese new energy sector has contributed remarkably to the green transformation of countries worldwide, not least the EU members, said China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong in April.

As manufacturing powerhouses, China and Germany are reinforcing collaboration in emerging sectors, including EVs and other green transformations. A growing number of Chinese enterprises are seizing new opportunities in Europe's largest economy by joining hands with local partners. A report by the Germany Trade & Invest earlier this week showed the country's foreign direct investment projects from China in 2023 surged by 42 percent year-on-year.

According to the report, one-fifth of investment projects by Chinese companies went to Germany's renewable energy sector, tripling the number in 2022. The increasing global engagement of Chinese firms has benefited Germany, as their investments have contributed to Germany's goal of achieving climate-neutral production by 2045, said Thomas Bozoyan, author of the report.

""China and Germany could be important partners in the global climate goals, which can only be achieved together. We would welcome Chinese companies coming to Germany and producing here,"" Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday. She noted the rapid ramp-up of the Chinese EV market has benefited the European country technologically.

In April, Zhu Jing, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Mission to the EU, also highlighted the strong consensus between China and Europe on green and low-carbon development at a tech forum held in Brussels. He emphasized eco-friendly cooperation between the two parties, pointing to substantial opportunities for collaboration in technology research and development, standardization, and industrial development.

""The pressing challenges of climate change entails enhanced green cooperation between China and the EU, which will not only expedite their green transformation but also contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Zhu said.

However, given the rise of China's EVs, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, as well as its promising green cooperation with the globe, some American politicians and media have employed the rhetoric of China's overcapacity in new energy industry.

Experts and officials from countries and international organizations refuted this fallacy and pointed out that politicizing China's new energy industry out of conservative protectionism to curb its development momentum shows no good signs for the global consensus and trend towards green and low-carbon pursuits, or for the burgeoning development of electric vehicles worldwide.

""The fact that buyers still desire Chinese EVs suggests that the global market is not saturated yet and the assertion of overcapacity in China may be misplaced,"" said Eunice Kamwendo, a senior official from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

Mueller also regarded the claim as ""questionable"", saying that ""the Chinese numbers do not speak for it.""

The German auto association chief said that around 16 percent of the cars produced in China are exported, while the German car industry has higher export figures, with three out of every four produced cars exported. ""We are not the right people to complain about overcapacity,"" instead, fair competition should be embraced globally and that is good for all parties, she emphasized.

Against the background of huge demand for new energy in the world, China's production capacity advantages have played an important role in promoting the globe's carbon-neutral goal. The green cooperation with China taking place in multiple European countries naturally dispels the unfounded claim.

From a global perspective, overcapacity in EVs is not happening, said Wu Kegang, a former China adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce. He suggested that more Chinese companies should consider deepening cooperation and building EV manufacturing closer to the UK and EU markets.

As to reducing global carbon emissions, Carl Fey, a professor of strategy at BI Norwegian Business School, told Xinhua, ""The Chinese government deserves a lot of credit for early recognizing and believing that electric vehicles could be a solution.""

In the short term, it's good that the Chinese companies produce more ""good quality, affordable electric cars from several manufacturers"" to the world; in the long run, it's also good that the European and U.S. vehicle-makers can compete in the global arena, Fey said.

""China has done a lot to help the world move towards a green future. And that is encouraging,"" he added.",english.news.cn,news,english.news.cn,,0.4745098039215687,453652556,10,,

The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

This information comes from data on quarterly estimates for greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity published by Eurostat today. Quarterly estimates of greenhouse gas emissions complement quarterly socio-economic data, such as GDP or employment. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained article on quarterly greenhouse gas emissions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2%) and manufacturing (-3.1%). Emissions by households remained almost stable.

Greenhouse gas emissions down in 22 EU countries

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23.0%), Bulgaria (-17.0%) and Finland (-9.0%).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg). Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions. The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP.

In the sun-baked hills of Garadagh, a country built on oil and gas is taking its first steps towards what it bills as a ""green"" future.

This is Azerbaijan's first large-scale solar power plant. It opened last October and the Emirati company developing it, Masdar, says it can power 110,000 homes.

Climate Home visited the solar park as part of a media tour organised and sponsored by the Azerbaijan COP29 Presidency, which is arranging the UN climate summit in Baku this November.

At the park's opening ceremony, in front of Sultan Al-Jaber - Masdar's CEO who led the COP28 climate summit in Dubai - Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev boasted about his country's determination in ""moving towards a green agenda"".

""This is our contribution not only to the future development of Azerbaijan but to the issues related to climate change,"" he told the assembled dignitaries.

But despite this rhetoric, climate scientists have questioned Azerbaijan's climate credentials as it prepares to host the COP29 summit.

An increase in renewable energy production does not mean Azerbaijan is planning to leave its vast oil and gas reserves in the ground. Aliyev said last month that Azerbaijan will try to sell abroad the gas it saves by not using it in power stations at home. Europe is the main target customer, as it shifts away from Russian gas supplies.

In Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan's net zero vision clashes with legacy of war

On top of selling its surplus, Azerbaijan is planning to extract more gas thanks, in part, to fresh investments from foreign fossil fuel giants like Britain's BP, France's TotalEnergies and Emirati oil giant ADNOC, which Al-Jaber also heads.

Bill Hare, CEO of climate science non-profit group Climate Analytics, called Azerbaijan's plans ""a fantasy"". ""Ramping up renewables won't make a dent in emissions unless they displace fossil fuels in the system,"" he told Climate Home. ""You can't tackle climate change without getting rid of fossil fuels.""

The COP29 Presidency had not responded to Climate Home's request for comment at the time of publication.

Azerbaijan is not alone in pursuing both renewable energy and fossil fuel production. Most fossil fuel producers - including wealthy nations like the US, UK and Canada - have no plans to stop producing oil and gas. That's despite the International Energy Agency's warning that new fossil fuel extraction projects are not compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C.

A fossil fuel economy

Azerbaijan's fossil fuel industry is steeped in history. As early as the 13th century, Italian explorer Marco Polo wrote of Baku's ""stream of oil in such abundance that a hundred ships may load there at once"".

In the 19th century, Azerbaijan gave birth to modern crude refining, and by the 20th century it accounted for around half of the world's oil production, helping fuel the Soviet Union's victory in World War Two.

Oil and gas remain omnipresent today. The Flame Towers, Baku's iconic skyscrapers, are a symbol of fossil fuel wealth. At night, their facades light up to display flickering flames in a reference to the naturally-occurring fires produced by gas leaks that earned Azerbaijan its name, ""The Land of Fire"".

The logo of SOCAR, the state-owned oil and gas firm, emblazons the national football team shirts, while one of the country's oldest oil fields sits just behind Baku's Olympic Stadium, the venue for the COP29 climate summit.

By global standards, Azerbaijan is no longer a major fossil fuel producer, pumping less than 1% of the world's oil and gas. But its economy remains heavily dependent on the income they generate. Fossil fuels make up over 90% of all exports and 64% of government revenue.

At the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin last month, Aliyev said that ""having oil and gas deposits is not our fault. It's a gift from God. We must not be judged by that. He added that ""our oil and gas will be needed for many more years, including in European markets"".

A shrinking market?

European countries have historically been the main destination market for Azerbaijani oil and gas, and flows have been rising in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

As Europe tried to wean itself off Moscow's supplies, the European Commission went looking around the world for alternative sources of gas to keep the lights on and curb skyrocketing prices. In Azerbaijan, it struck a new deal to double gas exports by 2027.

Baku is now scrambling to make good on that pact, while using it as a lever to expand its lucrative gas industry. The country could boost its gas production by more than a third over the next decade, according to data analysis by campaigning group Global Witness.

""We are largely investing in increasing our gas production,"" said Aliyev in Berlin, ""because Europe needs more gas from new sources.""

But energy experts question that reasoning. While looking for new gas supplies in the short term, the war in Ukraine also prompted the EU to fast-track its transition towards renewable sources of energy. Its strategic energy plan, laid out in 2022, would see overall gas demand in the bloc halve by 2030.

""There will be a lot of supply globally and not that much demand on the European side,"" said E3G analyst Maria Pastukhova. ""Looking at the amounts alone, the EU will not need any additional gas from Azerbaijan if it delivers on its energy transition policies.""

Clean, cheap or fair - which countries should pump the last oil and gas?

But much will also depend on what kind of gas the block will continue to rely on. Norway, Europe's top supplier, Algeria and Azerbaijan provide it through pipelines, while the United States and Qatar ship liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the continent.

""It's hard to say at the moment [which supplies will remain],"" added Pastukhova. ""But it isn't very likely that Azerbaijan can continue to bank on crazy gas revenues from the EU. We don't see readiness from European buyers to sign long-term contracts beyond 2035.""

Sell, don't burn

Meanwhile, Baku also wants to ensure that its gas is channelled towards the lucrative export market not burned at home.

Central to this strategy is the rollout of renewable energy. With strong winds blowing from the Caspian Sea and sun shining for a large part of the year, Azerbaijan boasts significant clean energy prospects.

But that potential has so far been largely untapped. Renewable sources, mainly from three hydro power stations, produced only 7% of Azerbaijan's electricity in 2023. The government wants to increase that to 30% by 2030.

If that target is met, Aliyev says that solar and wind will pump 5 gigawatts of clean electricity into the national grid, freeing up ""at least"" 5 billion cubic metres of gas for the European market.

At Masdar's sprawling solar park in Garadagh, this plan is being rolled out. The park spans the equivalent of 770 football pitches, but was built in just under two years. It cost $262 million, with multilateral development banks stumping up just under half of that.

Speaking to journalists inside the plant's control room, Kamran Huseynov, deputy director of the Azerbaijan Renewable Energy Agency, said eight more solar and wind projects are being developed for the coming years. ""We are quite sure we can reach the target [of 30% renewables capacity] by 2028,"" he added.

As in Garadagh, foreign energy companies will be at the helm of those eight projects. Masdar will build two more solar parks and one onshore wind farm. Saudi Arabia's ACWA Power is erecting a wind farm just north of Baku by the Caspian Sea.

Renewables-processed fossil fuels?

Later this year, BP is expected to start building a solar farm in the district of Jabrayil. This is one of the territories Azerbaijan captured after a long-running dispute with Armenia centred on the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Baku seized control of these areas in a two-part military offensive that started in 2020 and ended last autumn. As a result, some 136,000 ethnic Armenians who had lived in Nagorno-Karabakh fled in a mass exodus which, according to Armenia and the EU Parliament, amounted to ""ethnic cleansing"". Azerbaijan has rejected those accusations.

In Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan's net zero vision clashes with legacy of war

The Azeri government is now promoting a green vision for Nagorno-Karabakh which involves the construction of government-branded ""net zero"" villages. It has also designated the region as a ""green energy zone"", aiming to attract investment in renewable energy.

BP was the first major international energy firm to jump at that opportunity. In 2022, the company's regional president for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, praised Baku's efforts to turn Karabakh into ""the heart of sustainable development"".

BP wants electricity produced from Jabrayil's solar power plant to make some of its vast oil and gas operations in Azerbaijan less dirty.

The British energy giant runs the Sangachal terminal, one of the world's largest oil and gas processing facilities and the starting point for the pipelines transporting gas to Europe. Processing all of this oil and gas requires power, which BP currently gets from burning gas in generators.

According to Elnur Soltanov, Azerbaijan's deputy energy minister and the COP29 CEO, these are ""very inefficient"" and produce ""some of the dirtiest electricity"" in the country. After being electrified, the fossil fuel processing plant will receive the same amount of electricity from the grid as the solar park generates, according to Azernenerji, the country's grid operator.

The process will also free up ""more gas to export to world markets"", BP says.

BP's project is being developed in partnership with SOCAR, Azerbaijan's state-owned oil and gas giant. After setting up a ""green energy"" unit last year, SOCAR says it is working with international companies, like BP, ""in order to get the know-how"" and ""learn in the process"" with the goal of transforming into a ""comprehensive energy company"".

""Sooner or later, hydrocarbons will slowly die out - not right away,"" Teymur Guliyev, deputy vice president for the energy transition at SOCAR, told reporters including Climate Home. ""But we have to start our transformation process when we still have plenty of time to plan accordingly, go through trial and error.""

How to move it

While the current priority for Azerbaijan's renewables push appears to be maximising its gas exports, the government is also wrangling over how to sell its clean energy to Europe, when gas demand falls.

COP29's Soltanov told Climate Home and other international journalists that he is ""very optimistic"" about Azerbaijan's green transition. ""Azerbaijan has been at the forefront of the oil revolution, it has been at the forefront of the gas revolution, and it has all the conditions to be at the forefront of the clean energy revolution as well,"" he added.

But the transportation of green electricity remains an obstacle.

The main option being explored is laying an electric cable under the Black Sea, stretching over 1,155 kilometres between Georgia and Romania. Originally the project, under discussion for several years, had the stated intention of linking Georgia to the European transmission network and boosting its energy security.

But it was recently revamped as a possible route to carry Azerbaijan's clean energy to the European market. In December 2022, the leaders of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania and Hungary formed a partnership to push the project forward, indicating it could be completed by 2029 at a cost of €2.3bn ($2.5bn). A two-year long feasibility study is currently in its final stage, according to President Aliyev.

Implementing the project could be challenging given the fragile geopolitical situation in the region. The cable would run just south of the Crimean Peninsula, under Russian control, and near a theatre of war in Ukraine with the strong presence of military vessels.

For Climate Analytics' Bill Hare, ""it's a tricky location to attract investment and get built at the moment, but it would provide a lot of benefits in the long-term"".

There are also questions over whether Azerbaijan's current plans to export green energy via the Black Sea cable will yield a high-enough return to compensate for selling less fossil fuel.

""Electricity trade is a stable source of revenue, but it is also capital-intensive and not very high margin,"" explained E3G's Pastukhova. ""It will not replace the same amount of export revenue that gas and oil have been contributing.""

""What Azerbaijan is doing right now [on renewables] is not enough and quite alarming because this country is so dependent on oil and gas revenue,"" she said.

Solar Panel Market Trend Analysis

A Regulatory Shift Towards Solar Installations

Fact to Growing environmental concerns and the need to transition towards renewable energy sources, there has been a more significant regulatory shift towards incentivizing solar installations in the solar panel market. Governments around the world are implementing policies such as tax incentives, feed-in tariffs, and other renewable energy mandates to promote the adoption of solar energy. In the Year 2023, solar PV alone accounted for three-quarters of renewable capacity additions worldwide. Renewable power capacity additions will continue to increase in the next five years, with solar PV and wind accounting for a record of about 96% of it because their generation costs are lower than both fossil and non-fossil alternatives in most countries and policies continue to support them.

This SFCR has been prepared based on the EU Directive 2009/138/EC and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35.

VIG Insurance Group, together with its individual companies, is the leading insurance group in Austria and the CEE region. Wiener Städtische Wechselseitiger Versicherungsverein - Vermögensverwaltung - Vienna Insurance Group (WSTW) is the majority shareholder owning around 70% of VIG Insurance Group.

In 2018, a notice from the competent supervisory authority, the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA), removed WSTW from its supervision of the Group, so that supervision of the Group is now performed at the level of VIG Holding. This SFCR reports on the solvency and financial condition of VIG Insurance Group in accordance with this decision and the legal requirements.

Chapter A presents business activities and performance. The Group is based in Vienna and with its insurance companies is the leading insurance group in Austria and the CEE region.

In 2023, VIG Insurance Group generated a premium volume in non-life business of TEUR 8,120,877 (2022: TEUR 7,173,003).

The total premium volume in life insurance business was TEUR 4,146,510 in 2023 (2022: TEUR 4,193,019). The total capital investment result in 2023 amounted to TEUR 284,255.

Due to interest rate developments on the capital market, on 21 April 2023 VIG Holding prematurely repurchased a portion of the subordinated bond from 2015, with the repurchase rate amounting to around 46% (EUR 185.6 million) of the original total nominal amount (EUR 400 million). The outstanding volume of the subordinated bond from 2015 in the amount of EUR 214.4 million can be called for the first time in March 2026.

With effect from 9 October 2023, VIG Holding called the outstanding volume of EUR 284.4 million of the subordinated bond from 2013.

The purchase agreement that was concluded on 29 November 2020 for the VIG Group acquisition of the companies of the Dutch company Aegon N.V. in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Türkiye has been successfully closed. The VIG Group finalised the acquisition of the Hungarian Aegon companies in March 2022. Consequently, the Hungarian state holding Corvinus holds a 45% stake in Aegon Hungary. The acquisition of the Turkish AEGON insurance company was closed in April 2022 and the acquisition of the Aegon companies in Poland and Romania was also completed in May 2023. The Aegon companies in Poland and Romania were not yet consolidated as of 31 December 2023.

On 30 November 2023, VIG increased its indirect participation in the Hungarian ALFA insurance company (formerly AEGON) and UNION insurance company from 55% to 90%. The Hungarian government retains its 10% stake in the Hungarian business via the state-owned holding company Corvinus.

In June 2023, the Czech company Global Assistance CZ implemented a pilot project in Croatia and, in collaboration with Frantisek Paum, owner of PAME-AUTO s.r.o., established Global Assistance Croatia, which will offer its customers car assistance services in Croatia, particularly during the summer. This means VIG Insurance Group now has nine assistance companies that provide customer support and service in twelve countries.

Together with energy utility company Wien Energie, the association VIG Energiegemeinschaft was established on 28 November 2023 as an institution for a citizens' energy community. This makes it possible for participating members in Austria to exchange electricity produced by their own photovoltaic systems and wind turbines, thus supporting its members' security of supply and environmental protection.

This SFCR has been prepared based on the EU Directive 2009/138/EC and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35.

VIG Holding, together with its individual companies, is the leading insurance group in Austria and the CEE region. Wiener Städtische Wechselseitiger Versicherungsverein - Vermögensverwaltung - Vienna Insurance Group (WSTW) is the main shareholder of Vienna Insurance Group AG Wiener Versicherung Gruppe with a share of 70%.

This report on the solvency and financial condition of VIG Holding as a solo company is in accordance with the legal requirements. The regulatory solvency and financial condition report for VIG Insurance Group is available on the VIG Holding website (www.vig.com).

Chapter A presents the business activities and performance of VIG Holding. VIG Holding's main activity is managing its insurance companies. VIG Holding also operates as an insurer and reinsurer, dealing with the international corporate and large customer business and mainly acting as an international reinsurance company for its subsidiaries.

In 2023, VIG Holding generated a premium volume before reinsurance of TEUR 1,669,758 (2022: TEUR 1,499,318). The

underwriting result in accordance with UGB/VAG was TEUR 32,298 (2022: TEUR 48,124). The combined ratio is a key figure used in property and casualty insurance and defined as the ratio of administrative expenses and claim payments to net earned premiums. VIG Holding had a ratio of 101.2% in 2023 (2022: 98.7%) net (after deduction of reinsurance portions), which is over 100% due to the combined ratio of the indirect business.

Due to interest rate developments on the capital market, on 21 April 2023 VIG Holding prematurely repurchased a portion of the subordinated bond from 2015, with the repurchase rate amounting to around 46% (EUR 185.6 million) of the original total nominal amount (EUR 400 million). The outstanding volume of the subordinated bond from 2015 in the amount of EUR 214.4 million can be called for the first time in March 2026.

With effect from 9 October 2023, VIG Holding called the outstanding volume of EUR 284.4 million of the subordinated bond from 2013.

The purchase agreement that was concluded on 29 November 2020 for the VIG Group acquisition of the companies of the Dutch company Aegon N.V. in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Türkiye has been successfully closed. The VIG Group finalised the acquisition of the Hungarian Aegon companies in March 2022. Consequently, the Hungarian state holding Corvinus holds a 45% stake in Aegon Hungary. The acquisition of the Turkish AEGON insurance company was closed in April 2022 and the acquisition of the Aegon companies in Poland and Romania was also completed in May 2023.

On 30 November 2023, VIG increased its indirect participation in the Hungarian ALFA insurance company (formerly AEGON) and UNION insurance company from 55% to 90%. The Hungarian government retains its 10% stake in the Hungarian business via the state-owned holding company Corvinus.

In June 2023, the Czech company Global Assistance CZ implemented a pilot project in Croatia and, in collaboration with Frantisek Paum, owner of PAME-AUTO s.r.o., established Global Assistance Croatia, which will offer its customers car assistance services in Croatia, particularly during the summer. This means VIG Insurance Group now has nine assistance companies that provide customer support and service in twelve countries.

Together with energy utility company Wien Energie, the association VIG Energiegemeinschaft was established on 28 November 2023 as an institution for a citizens' energy community. This makes it possible for participating members in Austria to exchange electricity produced by their own photovoltaic systems and wind turbines, thus supporting its members' security of supply and environmental protection.

Brenmiller is advancing potential projects in 12 industries. Food and beverage, consumer goods, energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals represent the largest share across 13 countries including the U.S., Spain, Hungary, Israel, and India.

Approximately two-thirds of the pipeline projects are equipment sales and one-third will be delivered through an Energy-as-a-Service model. Nearly all Brenmiller's pipeline projects convert renewable electricity into process heat.

Brenmiller's bGen TES technology replaces the need for fossil fuel boilers at industrial and power plants, which contribute to nearly one-quarter of all global emissions. It uses crushed rocks to store low-cost electricity from renewable or other sustainable sources and dispatches steam, hot water or hot air according to customers' needs. Brenmiller's TES technology is modular and highly configurable and provides heavy-emitting and mission-critical customers with scalable access to zero-emission heat while ensuring 24/7 operational reliability.

""The nearly fifty active project proposals, offers and negotiations our team has going with some of the largest and most innovative industrials and energy companies is great for business, but it's even better for the planet: It reflects both our customers' confidence in our ability to deliver and shifting attitudes toward decarbonization market-wide,"" stated Brenmiller's Chairman and CEO, Avi Brenmiller. ""Several of these projects are in advanced stages of negotiations and we anticipate that two to four of them may advance into binding, revenue-generating contracts in the coming quarters.""

The cheaper green electricity it generates satisfies the demand of more than 100,000 households in the country.

The green project, developed by China's Norinco International Cooperation Ltd., is a ""model of cooperation"" that benefits both countries, said Senj Mayor Jurica Tomljanovic. The revenue from its operation has been used to invest in infrastructure, water supply, sewerage, beaches and ""everything important for the residents"" in the city.

A beacon of the successful collaboration between China and Croatia, the wind farm also epitomizes the trend in recent years that the cooperation between China and European countries boasts great potential, particularly in green energy development. WIN-WIN GREEN COOPERATION

As Chinese battery producer CATL announced the decision to build its second European battery plant in Hungary in 2022, the two countries have witnessed increasing cooperation in advancing many green projects. Chinese carmaker BYD also decided to invest in a production base for its electric vehicles (EVs) in the European country.

Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy regarded the investment that came along with the rise of China's EV industry as an opportunity. By welcoming Chinese companies, Hungary has become a hub for electric car and battery manufacturing.

Cooperation with China is not only beneficial to Hungary, but also to the EU as a whole, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

The BYD plant will boost Europe's green transformation and improve the wellbeing of local people. Moreover, healthy competition with Chinese companies has also promoted innovation and R&D by European companies, said Kiszelly.

The entry of Arcfox, the EV brand of Chinese giant automaker Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation, into the European market through Spain last week made another significant mark in China-Europe energy cooperation.

In collaboration with Spanish Atium Logistic Group, Arcfox has established a logistics center for vehicle storage, deposit, and exportation at the port of Ferrol in northwest Spain. The center will cover a storage area of 9,000 square meters. By 2025, the Chinese firm expects sales of 5,000-8,000 units in the European market.

""This is an initiative with a long-term vision that promotes Ferrol's prominence on the map of global logistics and, of course, of China, which could be a magnet for new investments,"" said Francisco Barea, president of the Port Authority of Ferrol.

In the northeastern Spanish city of Barcelona, a new pact signed in April between Spain's Ebro-EV Motors and China's Chery Automobile will not only turn the city into an EV production center but also deliver benefits to its residents.

The joint venture created by the pact will re-employ some 1,250 former auto manufacturing workers, who lost their jobs in 2021 when Nissan closed its Barcelona plant.

Rosa Maria Jimenez was one of them. ""For such a large and important company in China as Chery to come here means that we'll be able to continue doing what we know best, which is making cars,"" Jimenez told Xinhua.

""This is going to create many jobs and not only for the workers in the company itself but all those jobs around that are connected to a car manufacturer,"" Jimenez added. The joint venture is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles a year in the Zona Franca port area. HIGHLY ANTICIPATED

The China-Europe cooperation in the green sector is poised to lead to more significant advancements in the global drive for sustainability.

Committed to providing high-quality products in coping with climate change, the Chinese new energy sector has contributed remarkably to the green transformation of countries worldwide, not least the EU members, said China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong in April.

As manufacturing powerhouses, China and Germany are reinforcing collaboration in emerging sectors, including EVs and other green transformations. A growing number of Chinese enterprises are seizing new opportunities in Europe's largest economy by joining hands with local partners. A report by the Germany Trade & Invest earlier this week showed the country's foreign direct investment projects from China in 2023 surged by 42 percent year-on-year.

According to the report, one-fifth of investment projects by Chinese companies went to Germany's renewable energy sector, tripling the number in 2022. The increasing global engagement of Chinese firms has benefited Germany, as their investments have contributed to Germany's goal of achieving climate-neutral production by 2045, said Thomas Bozoyan, author of the report.

""China and Germany could be important partners in the global climate goals, which can only be achieved together. We would welcome Chinese companies coming to Germany and producing here,"" Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday. She noted the rapid ramp-up of the Chinese EV market has benefited the European country technologically.

In April, Zhu Jing, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Mission to the EU, also highlighted the strong consensus between China and Europe on green and low-carbon development at a tech forum held in Brussels. He emphasized eco-friendly cooperation between the two parties, pointing to substantial opportunities for collaboration in technology research and development, standardization, and industrial development.

""The pressing challenges of climate change entails enhanced green cooperation between China and the EU, which will not only expedite their green transformation but also contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Zhu said. OVERCAPACITY FALLACY

However, given the rise of China's EVs, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, as well as its promising green cooperation with the globe, some American politicians and media have employed the rhetoric of China's overcapacity in new energy industry.

Experts and officials from countries and international organizations refuted this fallacy and pointed out that politicizing China's new energy industry out of conservative protectionism to curb its development momentum shows no good signs for the global consensus and trend towards green and low-carbon pursuits, or for the burgeoning development of electric vehicles worldwide.

""The fact that buyers still desire Chinese EVs suggests that the global market is not saturated yet and the assertion of overcapacity in China may be misplaced,"" said Eunice Kamwendo, a senior official from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

Mueller also regarded the claim as ""questionable"", saying that ""the Chinese numbers do not speak for it.""

The German auto association chief said that around 16 percent of the cars produced in China are exported, while the German car industry has higher export figures, with three out of every four produced cars exported. ""We are not the right people to complain about overcapacity,"" instead, fair competition should be embraced globally and that is good for all parties, she emphasized.

Against the background of huge demand for new energy in the world, China's production capacity advantages have played an important role in promoting the globe's carbon-neutral goal. The green cooperation with China taking place in multiple European countries naturally dispels the unfounded claim.

From a global perspective, overcapacity in EVs is not happening, said Wu Kegang, a former China adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce. He suggested that more Chinese companies should consider deepening cooperation and building EV manufacturing closer to the UK and EU markets.

As to reducing global carbon emissions, Carl Fey, a professor of strategy at BI Norwegian Business School, told Xinhua, ""The Chinese government deserves a lot of credit for early recognizing and believing that electric vehicles could be a solution.""

In the short term, it's good that the Chinese companies produce more ""good quality, affordable electric cars from several manufacturers"" to the world; in the long run, it's also good that the European and U.S. vehicle-makers can compete in the global arena, Fey said.

""China has done a lot to help the world move towards a green future. And that is encouraging,"" he added.

""China's strategy is to undermine EU unity while, at the same time, increasing its clout in separate Member States,"" the weekly observes. It specifies that two of Xi's European destinations - Serbia and Hungary, ""remain reliably pro-China inclined on a continent where, as public opinion polls show, China's reputation has worsened."" The Chinese President's tour did not result in breakthroughs on trade, the war in China and other issues that have soured EU-Chinese relations in recent years. Only a long list of agreements were signed on new joint projects which China says it will finance. In a bid to drive a wedge between the EU and the US, Beijing promotes the idea of European strategic autonomy, Capital notes. The hope is probably that the EU may act as a counterweight of the perceived American ""hostility"" towards China. Xi is trying to persuade the EU leaders not to follow suit after the US in restricting the import of electric vehicles and other high-tech Chinese products. ""China is drawn by the Western Balkans because of their geostrategic location and proximity to the EU markets and views Serbia as a strategic European transport hub,"" the weekly points out. Before his arrival in Hungary, Xi praised Orban's Government for pursuing an ""independent"" foreign policy and ""resisting"" the great powers' policy. In a separate item, Capital writes that two-way trade between Bulgaria and China has been soaring over the last two decades, with Beijing invariably running a surplus. China ranks as Bulgaria's sixth largest import market, while Bulgarian exports to China is just a fifth of the trade flow in the opposite direction. At just EUR 150 million in 2023 and less than BGN 1.2 billion over the last ten years, Chinese investments in Bulgaria are ""negligibly low,"" the weekly notes.

Trud frontpages its coverage of Russian President Vladimir Putin to China, borrowing the headline from a BBC report: ""Xi and Putin Want Political Solution to Ukraine Crisis.""

Interviewed on Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) Friday morning, political scientist Vladimir Shopov said: ""We are witnessing the shaping of a very clear strategic axis including not only China and Russia but also countries like Iran and North Korea."" ""The deepening asymmetry in the relations between Russia and China, however, becomes particularly visible and already meets with negative reactions in certain circles in Moscow,"" the interviewee observed. He stressed that this partnership ""guarantees Vladimir Putin's survival."" ""From now on, the EU does not have the luxury to be a bystander merely interpreting developments. Europe will have to identify a new tool kit to respond to potential threats,"" Shopov concluded.

ROBERT FICO'S ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Journalist Petar Karaboev said on bTV Friday morning that ""Slovakia is a country fraught with contradictions. It is deeply divided - thanks to Robert Fico."" ""The focus [of reactions to the attack] should be on whether Slovaks, their State, political system, media and legality will bridge the gap, because they are still on the brink and looking into the abyss,"" he commented. According to the interviewee, the assassination attempt against Fico ""is catalyzing the polarization in the 5 million strong country.""

THE HOME SCENE

A signed comment in Capital Weekly describes the recent meeting of Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) Co-chair Delyan Peevski with the ambassadors of European countries to Bulgaria as ""his first success since his installation at the head of the MRF: the Western ambassadors who, until recently, shunned him, are now legitimating him."" ""In fact, this is a routine event: the ambassadors' corps often meets with the leaderships of parliamentary groups,"" the author says. ""For Peevski & Co., however, the presence in the same room with the representatives of the Western countries in Sofia is an important part of his new image, which says that while he may be sanctioned for corruption by the US and Britain, the rest have no choice. They will pretend as if nothing has happened, they will be seeing him, having themselves photographed with him, and voters will draw their conclusion and vote for him.""

Bulgarian Helsinki Committee Co-chair Adela Kachaunova argued in a BNR interview Friday morning that ""persons sanctioned for corruption must not be legitimated after spending too many years in politics. They have given every cause for concern, but the European partners do not show any signs of distancing themselves [from such persons], no clear position at all. These things are indicative and very important."" In her opinion, the European partners ""apparently do not see the true faces of [Bulgarian] politicians sufficiently clearly or are reluctant to see them."" Kachaunova is skeptical about the effectiveness of ad hoc prosecutor Daniela Taleva and raised the question about the resources available to her for her investigations.

In an analysis in www.segabg.com, Svetoslav Terziev argues that journalists-turned-politicians disgrace the media landscape. ""Petar Volgin, Elena Yoncheva, Ivo Hristov, Nikolay Barekov, Anton Hekimyan have cashed in on their professional prestige and will not regain it,"" the author writes.

* * *

Interviewed on the bTV morning show, Petar Volgin, who until recently hosted a show on National Radio and is now running for the European Parliament as a candidate of Vazrazhdane, said that, if elected, he will insist on fewer migrants in Bulgaria and the continued operation of the coal-fired power plants. His foremost priority will be to counter the desire of some of the large European countries to impose qualified majority for important decision making. ""I don't want Europe to become a space without freedom,"" Volgin commented.

JUSTICE

On two full inside pages, 24 Chasa has interviewed Deputy Sofia City Prosecutor Desislava Petrova. ""The entire jurist community does not approve of the draft Judicial System Act. The universal idea of the bill is to put prosecutors under political control, and to make this idea publicly palatable, it has been insinuated persistently that the prosecution service does not work. The draft establishes political control over prosecutors by means of an entirely politically dominated Supreme Prosecutorial Council, where the entire personnel management power is concentrated. This will lead to never ending disciplinary proceedings against prosecutors, to pressuring them until they are replaced by new obedient people who do not prioritize their independence,"" Petrova comments. She argues that a refusal to institute or a dismissal of criminal proceedings is not an indication that the prosecution service is idle, considering that the court reversed just 0.087% of such refusals last year. Replying to a question, the interviewee says that ""we expect the legislative pathology to be withdrawn and the bill to be reconsidered in its entirety, responsibly and with concern for its real consequences, with consideration for the arguments of all stakeholders.""

ELECTION CAMPAIGN FUNDING

Telegraph has checked the Bulgarian National Audit Office register of funding for the election campaign and found that just BGN 46,000 have been raised so far for the European Parliament election. Out of five cash contributions, three have been made by Daniel Lorer of Continue the Change - Democratic Bulgaria (CC-DB), totalling BGN 39,000 (declared as proceeds from the sale of real estate). The contributions for the national parliamentary elections approximate BGN 264,000, of which some BGN 67,000 have come from supporters and over BGN 197,000 from the MP candidates themselves. The largest single contribution was made by former regional development minister Andrei Tsekov, who is running on the CC-DB list in Blagoevgrad: BGN 30,000 (salary savings). Traditionally, GERB-UDF and MRF do not raise campaign donations. Vazrazhdane has not reported any, either. CC-DB have raised the largest amount: nearly BGN 140,000. Donations for the Socialist Party are nearly BGN 28,000, and those for There Is Such a People a little over BGN 10,000.

VOTING ABROAD

As many as 12,942 or more than half of the 27,707 applications for voting abroad in the European Parliament elections, and 4,257 applications out of a total of 38,393 for voting abroad in the national parliamentary elections have been rejected by the Central Election Commission, 24 Chasa reports, referring to the Commission's website. The reasons are missing or mistaken particulars or applicants who are not qualified voters. The largest number of applications have been submitted in Turkey: 25,537 for MPs and just 39 for MEPs. Traditionally, a large number of voters will also exercise their franchise in Germany, Spain and the UK.

NORTH MACEDONIA

Skopje-based freelance journalist Bojan Stojkovski writes in a two-page analysis in Capital Weekly that the conservative VMRO-DPMNE that won both the parliamentary and presidential elections in North Macedonia is coming back to power much stronger than before and with a leadership that is almost cleansed of its problematic past. The author sees an indication that the new government is willing to do what it has been doing before: play a ""wait-and-see"" game, just as at the time of Nikola Gruevski in the disputes with Greece and Bulgaria. ""I don't think VMRO-DPMNE have a clear idea how to handle the constitutional amendments and European integration. Or, if they do, they don't communicate it clearly to the public,"" Eurothink brain trust Executive Director Dimitar Nikolovski told Capital. He nevertheless expects the constitutional revisions to be included in the coalition agreement with VLEN and to be adopted within a year after the elections. ""This will follow the awareness that the EU negotiating framework cannot possibly be revised,"" the expert comments. ""Just as before, Bulgaria and the Bulgarians - in the Republic of North Macedonia and in general, have been the convenient justification for the unwillingness or inability of the Macedonian political elite to start the country's tangible Europeanization,"" Skopje-based journalist Atanas Velickov told the weekly.

www.dnevnik.bg has rounded up the opinions of observers in Skopje and Sofia while a new cabinet in North Macedonia is expected to be formed and parliamentary elections in Bulgaria are to be held on June 9. Former deputy foreign minister Lyubomir Kyuchukov does not expect Skopje to withdraw unilaterally from the treaties with Sofia or Athens. ""A review of North Macedonia's treaties with Greece and Bulgaria is practically impossible because neither of these two countries would accept this,"" he argues. According to Macedonian analyst Petar Arsovski, ""VMRO-DPMNE and the country's new President actually believe that the negotiating framework [for EU accession] is acceptable. I don't think they will make an attempt to reject the negotiating framework. But I believe they need political motivation. They need to say that they will change something, be it cosmetic and insignificant. It may be some symbolic statement that these are the final terms. But even such cosmetic concession may prove a challenge."" Kyuchukov is adamant: ""Until the Bulgarians are included in North Macedonia's Constitution, the country will simply not start actual negotiations on EU membership. Brussels has already ripened to the idea of splitting Albania from North Macedonia [in the EU accession process]. The problem is that this may have a definite adverse impact on the region's stability and may cause serious ethnic tensions and political destabilization of North Macedonia itself.""

COUNTER-CORRUPTION REFORM

In a two-page analysis contributed to Capital Weekly, Andrey Yankulov, senior legal expert at the non-governmental Anti-Corruption Fund, argues that the Commission for Anti-Corruption and Illegal Assets Forfeiture, which was established by GERB in 2018, ""turned into a tool of harassment and racketeering of business and political opponents. The counter-corruption reform practically cemented this completely discredited commission in its existing name complement for an indefinite period of time, promoting its Chair Anton Slavchev to head of both [the newly set up Commission for Anti-Corruption (CAC) and Commission for Illegal Assets Forfeiture] and, moreover, vesting the two bodies with more powers than before."" ""The ultimate paradox is that these two commissions with an identical complement are already two distinct legal persons, have separate administrations, separate budgets and separate BULSTAT codes,"" the expert writes, recalling that, under the law, a new complement of the CAC had to be elected by January 8, 2024 but an election procedure was never initiated. ""The blocked election of a complement of the new CAC is one of the four reforms that Brussels regards as incomplete, which is a hurdle to the second payment under the [National] Recovery [and Resilience] Plan,"" Yankulov explains.

POWER SUPPLY

A two-page signed article in Capital Weekly predicts that the postponement of the liberalization of the wholesale electricity market will result in a 3-4% hike of household electricity as from July 1 because, instead of being charged at exchange prices, this power supply sector will continue to be rated at prices fixed by the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (EWRC), which factor in the expensive electricity supplied by State-owned Maritsa East 2 TPP with its high production costs. The deficit in the Electricity System Security Fund (ESSF) is expected to reach BGN 550 million by the end of June. The Finance Ministry will try to close the gap - again on taxpayers money, the author notes.

For its part, Trud reports that the Kozloduy N-Plant will withdraw its request for a 30% rise of the price of its electricity and will submit a new proposal on Monday. ""Before the EWRC adopts a decision on household electricity prices from July 1, the Government will take measures to offset the deficit in the ESSF without this affecting the prices paid by households,"" caretaker Energy Minister Vladimir Malinov is quoted as saying.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

24 Chasa runs a page-long interview with Communications Regulations Commission (CRC) Chairman Ivan Dimitrov, who describes the Bulgarian electronic communications market as ""exceedingly dynamic and steadily growing, one of the most stable and important economic sectors, with a huge and booming volume"". In 2022 the market was worth BGN 3.4 billion, up 7% from 2021. The BGN 654 million invested in it in 2022 was an increase of 15%, year on year. At the end of 2023, the CRC granted authorizations for the use of radio spectrum frequencies in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz range, which is used for high-speed connectivity in more sparsely populated and outlying locations, where building a fixed network is economically unprofitable, Dimitrov explains.

The top story in Trud says that electricity distribution companies have asked the EWRC to introduce a charge for access to the grid for properties which do not consume electricity, like vacant apartments and weekend houses.

DEFENCE INDUSTRY

TEREM-HOLDING Executive Director Kalin Dimitrov told Telegraph that the plant is starting to manufacture kamikaze drones. The unmanned combat aerial vehicles cost some BGN 2,000 but are capable of destroying tanks worth EUR 10-15 million, Dimitrov explained. The project for making cheap, low-tech drones is implemented in partnership with a thoroughly experienced Ukrainian company which provides the know-how. After a presentation before the Land Forces at the beginning of this year, assembly of the first batch is in progress. The holding is also developing a series of specialized munitions for drones, which will be mass-produced. They can hit targets at a distance of 10-15 km. The CEO said that work is underway on mastering the manufacture of 155 mm artillery shells. The first batch is ready, and serial production is forthcoming.

BOMB SQUAD

The main front-page story in Telegraph, continued on two full inside pages, tells about the work of the bomb squad of the Specialized Counterterrorism Commando. The bomb disposal experts are alerted on an average 15 occasions monthly. They respond to alerts or for routine checks of embassies, homes, football matches and other crowd events. Most reports concern abandoned suspicious suitcases, bags and other luggage. Quite a few of the reports are about ammunition like grenades stolen from defence industry plants or military facilities. In 99% of the cases, the luggage items do not contain an explosive. While there are no gender eligibility requirements for joining the team, the squad is all-male, says its commander, Chief Inspector Stiliyan Chochev. Asked what kind of improvised explosive devices are made by Bulgarians, he answers: ""The simplest and cheapest, using what they can steal. For some time now, however, they have been using IED-making directions they find online."" Chochev recalls a case in 2023, when a flight bound from Germany to Turkey made an emergency landing in Sofia because a laptop forgotten on a passenger seat was suspected to be a blast trigger. The laptop was removed to a safe location and was disposed of by a controlled explosion.

MISSING PERSONS

24 Chassa frontpages a report according to which 274 missing person reports have been filed since the beginning of 2024, and 200 of them are searched for internationally. The number is large because it includes people who went missing in previous years but remain lost. Interpol Yellow Notices have been issued for 147 Bulgarians: 35 women and 112 men. Of the 796 people who disappeared in Bulgaria in 2023, 639 have been found, and the remaining 157 continue to be searched for in 2024. Between January 1 and 31, 2022, a record 769 missing persons reports were filed and 680 persons were declared found. The respective figures for 2021 were 265 and 200 and, for 2020, 183 and 137.

BULGARIAN SCHOOLS ABROAD

On two full inside pages, Telegraph has interviewed Mimi Nicheva, Principal of the Sts Cyril and Methodius Sunday School in Athens, which recently marked its 20th birthday. Nicheva acknowledges the ""adequate and timely"" assistance of the Bulgarian State in the person of the Ministry of Education and Science and Bulgaria's Embassy in Greece. The functioning of the school is financed by the Ministry, while the pupils' parents pay small tuition fees. The institution also relies on sponsors. Replying to a question, the interviewee says that the main challenges facing Bulgarian educational institutions abroad is the growing number of children who do not speak Bulgarian, the lack of a clear mechanism for enrolling children left outside the system, the increasing difficulties in finding qualified teachers, and the Bulgarian history and geography textbooks that are too complicated for expat children. The principal says that there are four Bulgarian Sunday schools in Athens with a combined enrolment of some 600. About 50 graduates of her school have continued their studies in Bulgaria.

BULGARIAN FOLK ENSEMBLES ABROAD

Duma carries a two-page interview with Association of Bulgarian Folk Ensembles Abroad Chair Radoslava Nedyalkova, who says that the Association was established in November 2016 and now has 36 affiliates paying membership dues. Otherwise, there are more than 200 such ensembles in Europe and over 200 in North America. The lack of qualified experienced choreographers to train and organize the dancers in these ensembles is a problem. ""We believe that the State must find a way to recognize our folk ensembles abroad, as has been the case with the Bulgarian Sunday schools,"" Nedyalkova argues. The Executive Agency for Bulgarians Abroad shares the view that folk ensembles abroad should be financed under a separate budget.",bta.bg,news,Българска Телеграфна Агенция,,0.06666666666666665,453641341,26,https://www.bta.bg/upload/4316416/media.review2.JPEG?l=750,

The cheaper green electricity it generates satisfies the demand of more than 100,000 households in the country.

The green project, developed by China's Norinco International Cooperation Ltd., is a ""model of cooperation"" that benefits both countries, said Senj Mayor Jurica Tomljanovic. The revenue from its operation has been used to invest in infrastructure, water supply, sewerage, beaches and ""everything important for the residents"" in the city.

A beacon of the successful collaboration between China and Croatia, the wind farm also epitomizes the trend in recent years that the cooperation between China and European countries boasts great potential, particularly in green energy development. WIN-WIN GREEN COOPERATION

As Chinese battery producer CATL announced the decision to build its second European battery plant in Hungary in 2022, the two countries have witnessed increasing cooperation in advancing many green projects. Chinese carmaker BYD also decided to invest in a production base for its electric vehicles (EVs) in the European country.

Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy regarded the investment that came along with the rise of China's EV industry as an opportunity. By welcoming Chinese companies, Hungary has become a hub for electric car and battery manufacturing.

Cooperation with China is not only beneficial to Hungary, but also to the EU as a whole, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

The BYD plant will boost Europe's green transformation and improve the wellbeing of local people. Moreover, healthy competition with Chinese companies has also promoted innovation and R&D by European companies, said Kiszelly.

The entry of Arcfox, the EV brand of Chinese giant automaker Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation, into the European market through Spain last week made another significant mark in China-Europe energy cooperation.

In collaboration with Spanish Atium Logistic Group, Arcfox has established a logistics center for vehicle storage, deposit, and exportation at the port of Ferrol in northwest Spain. The center will cover a storage area of 9,000 square meters. By 2025, the Chinese firm expects sales of 5,000-8,000 units in the European market.

""This is an initiative with a long-term vision that promotes Ferrol's prominence on the map of global logistics and, of course, of China, which could be a magnet for new investments,"" said Francisco Barea, president of the Port Authority of Ferrol.

In the northeastern Spanish city of Barcelona, a new pact signed in April between Spain's Ebro-EV Motors and China's Chery Automobile will not only turn the city into an EV production center but also deliver benefits to its residents.

The joint venture created by the pact will re-employ some 1,250 former auto manufacturing workers, who lost their jobs in 2021 when Nissan closed its Barcelona plant.

Rosa Maria Jimenez was one of them. ""For such a large and important company in China as Chery to come here means that we'll be able to continue doing what we know best, which is making cars,"" Jimenez told Xinhua.

""This is going to create many jobs and not only for the workers in the company itself but all those jobs around that are connected to a car manufacturer,"" Jimenez added. The joint venture is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles a year in the Zona Franca port area. HIGHLY ANTICIPATED

The China-Europe cooperation in the green sector is poised to lead to more significant advancements in the global drive for sustainability.

Committed to providing high-quality products in coping with climate change, the Chinese new energy sector has contributed remarkably to the green transformation of countries worldwide, not least the EU members, said China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong in April.

As manufacturing powerhouses, China and Germany are reinforcing collaboration in emerging sectors, including EVs and other green transformations. A growing number of Chinese enterprises are seizing new opportunities in Europe's largest economy by joining hands with local partners. A report by the Germany Trade & Invest earlier this week showed the country's foreign direct investment projects from China in 2023 surged by 42 percent year-on-year.

According to the report, one-fifth of investment projects by Chinese companies went to Germany's renewable energy sector, tripling the number in 2022. The increasing global engagement of Chinese firms has benefited Germany, as their investments have contributed to Germany's goal of achieving climate-neutral production by 2045, said Thomas Bozoyan, author of the report.

""China and Germany could be important partners in the global climate goals, which can only be achieved together. We would welcome Chinese companies coming to Germany and producing here,"" Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday. She noted the rapid ramp-up of the Chinese EV market has benefited the European country technologically.

In April, Zhu Jing, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Mission to the EU, also highlighted the strong consensus between China and Europe on green and low-carbon development at a tech forum held in Brussels. He emphasized eco-friendly cooperation between the two parties, pointing to substantial opportunities for collaboration in technology research and development, standardization, and industrial development.

""The pressing challenges of climate change entails enhanced green cooperation between China and the EU, which will not only expedite their green transformation but also contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Zhu said. OVERCAPACITY FALLACY

However, given the rise of China's EVs, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, as well as its promising green cooperation with the globe, some American politicians and media have employed the rhetoric of China's overcapacity in new energy industry.

Experts and officials from countries and international organizations refuted this fallacy and pointed out that politicizing China's new energy industry out of conservative protectionism to curb its development momentum shows no good signs for the global consensus and trend towards green and low-carbon pursuits, or for the burgeoning development of electric vehicles worldwide.

""The fact that buyers still desire Chinese EVs suggests that the global market is not saturated yet and the assertion of overcapacity in China may be misplaced,"" said Eunice Kamwendo, a senior official from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

Mueller also regarded the claim as ""questionable"", saying that ""the Chinese numbers do not speak for it.""

The German auto association chief said that around 16 percent of the cars produced in China are exported, while the German car industry has higher export figures, with three out of every four produced cars exported. ""We are not the right people to complain about overcapacity,"" instead, fair competition should be embraced globally and that is good for all parties, she emphasized.

Against the background of huge demand for new energy in the world, China's production capacity advantages have played an important role in promoting the globe's carbon-neutral goal. The green cooperation with China taking place in multiple European countries naturally dispels the unfounded claim.

From a global perspective, overcapacity in EVs is not happening, said Wu Kegang, a former China adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce. He suggested that more Chinese companies should consider deepening cooperation and building EV manufacturing closer to the UK and EU markets.

As to reducing global carbon emissions, Carl Fey, a professor of strategy at BI Norwegian Business School, told Xinhua, ""The Chinese government deserves a lot of credit for early recognizing and believing that electric vehicles could be a solution.""

In the short term, it's good that the Chinese companies produce more ""good quality, affordable electric cars from several manufacturers"" to the world; in the long run, it's also good that the European and U.S. vehicle-makers can compete in the global arena, Fey said.

""China has done a lot to help the world move towards a green future. And that is encouraging,"" he added.

""The fact that buyers still desire Chinese EVs suggests that the global market is not saturated yet and the assertion of overcapacity in China may be misplaced,"" said Eunice Kamwendo, a senior official from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

Mueller also regarded the claim as ""questionable"", saying that ""the Chinese numbers do not speak for it.""

The German auto association chief said that around 16 percent of the cars produced in China are exported, while the German car industry has higher export figures, with three out of every four produced cars exported. ""We are not the right people to complain about overcapacity,"" instead, fair competition should be embraced globally and that is good for all parties, she emphasized.

Against the background of huge demand for new energy in the world, China's production capacity advantages have played an important role in promoting the globe's carbon-neutral goal. The green cooperation with China taking place in multiple European countries naturally dispels the unfounded claim.

From a global perspective, overcapacity in EVs is not happening, said Wu Kegang, a former China adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce. He suggested that more Chinese companies should consider deepening cooperation and building EV manufacturing closer to the UK and EU markets.

As to reducing global carbon emissions, Carl Fey, a professor of strategy at BI Norwegian Business School, told Xinhua, ""The Chinese government deserves a lot of credit for early recognizing and believing that electric vehicles could be a solution.""

In the short term, it's good that the Chinese companies produce more ""good quality, affordable electric cars from several manufacturers"" to the world; in the long run, it's also good that the European and U.S. vehicle-makers can compete in the global arena, Fey said.

""China has done a lot to help the world move towards a green future. And that is encouraging,"" he added.

The cheaper green electricity it generates satisfies the demand of more than 100,000 households in the country.

The green project, developed by China's Norinco International Cooperation Ltd., is a ""model of cooperation"" that benefits both countries, said Senj Mayor Jurica Tomljanovic. The revenue from its operation has been used to invest in infrastructure, water supply, sewerage, beaches and ""everything important for the residents"" in the city.

A beacon of the successful collaboration between China and Croatia, the wind farm also epitomizes the trend in recent years that the cooperation between China and European countries boasts great potential, particularly in green energy development. WIN-WIN GREEN COOPERATION

As Chinese battery producer CATL announced the decision to build its second European battery plant in Hungary in 2022, the two countries have witnessed increasing cooperation in advancing many green projects. Chinese carmaker BYD also decided to invest in a production base for its electric vehicles (EVs) in the European country.

Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy regarded the investment that came along with the rise of China's EV industry as an opportunity. By welcoming Chinese companies, Hungary has become a hub for electric car and battery manufacturing.

Cooperation with China is not only beneficial to Hungary, but also to the EU as a whole, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary's Szazadveg Institute, told Xinhua in a recent interview.

The BYD plant will boost Europe's green transformation and improve the wellbeing of local people. Moreover, healthy competition with Chinese companies has also promoted innovation and R&D by European companies, said Kiszelly.

The entry of Arcfox, the EV brand of Chinese giant automaker Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation, into the European market through Spain last week made another significant mark in China-Europe energy cooperation.

In collaboration with Spanish Atium Logistic Group, Arcfox has established a logistics center for vehicle storage, deposit, and exportation at the port of Ferrol in northwest Spain. The center will cover a storage area of 9,000 square meters. By 2025, the Chinese firm expects sales of 5,000-8,000 units in the European market.

""This is an initiative with a long-term vision that promotes Ferrol's prominence on the map of global logistics and, of course, of China, which could be a magnet for new investments,"" said Francisco Barea, president of the Port Authority of Ferrol.

In the northeastern Spanish city of Barcelona, a new pact signed in April between Spain's Ebro-EV Motors and China's Chery Automobile will not only turn the city into an EV production center but also deliver benefits to its residents.

The joint venture created by the pact will re-employ some 1,250 former auto manufacturing workers, who lost their jobs in 2021 when Nissan closed its Barcelona plant.

Rosa Maria Jimenez was one of them. ""For such a large and important company in China as Chery to come here means that we'll be able to continue doing what we know best, which is making cars,"" Jimenez told Xinhua.

""This is going to create many jobs and not only for the workers in the company itself but all those jobs around that are connected to a car manufacturer,"" Jimenez added. The joint venture is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles a year in the Zona Franca port area. HIGHLY ANTICIPATED

The China-Europe cooperation in the green sector is poised to lead to more significant advancements in the global drive for sustainability.

Committed to providing high-quality products in coping with climate change, the Chinese new energy sector has contributed remarkably to the green transformation of countries worldwide, not least the EU members, said China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong in April.

As manufacturing powerhouses, China and Germany are reinforcing collaboration in emerging sectors, including EVs and other green transformations. A growing number of Chinese enterprises are seizing new opportunities in Europe's largest economy by joining hands with local partners. A report by the Germany Trade & Invest earlier this week showed the country's foreign direct investment projects from China in 2023 surged by 42 percent year-on-year.

According to the report, one-fifth of investment projects by Chinese companies went to Germany's renewable energy sector, tripling the number in 2022. The increasing global engagement of Chinese firms has benefited Germany, as their investments have contributed to Germany's goal of achieving climate-neutral production by 2045, said Thomas Bozoyan, author of the report.

""China and Germany could be important partners in the global climate goals, which can only be achieved together. We would welcome Chinese companies coming to Germany and producing here,"" Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday. She noted the rapid ramp-up of the Chinese EV market has benefited the European country technologically.

In April, Zhu Jing, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Mission to the EU, also highlighted the strong consensus between China and Europe on green and low-carbon development at a tech forum held in Brussels. He emphasized eco-friendly cooperation between the two parties, pointing to substantial opportunities for collaboration in technology research and development, standardization, and industrial development.

""The pressing challenges of climate change entails enhanced green cooperation between China and the EU, which will not only expedite their green transformation but also contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"" Zhu said. OVERCAPACITY FALLACY

Amsterdam - 17 May 2024 - Photon Energy N.V. (WSE: PEN, ""Photon Energy Group"", the ""Group"" or the ""Company"") announces financial results for the first quarter of 2024.

""The first quarter of 2024 was marked by our continued efforts to make our business model more resilient to further economic and geopolitical fluctuations. First of all, we have managed to complete the rebalancing of our IPP portfolio which, as of 1 April 2024, represents a nearly 50/50 split between the support scheme mechanism, or FIT, and a merchant model, selling on day-ahead spot prices. Transitioning to a more balanced portfolio between the two schemes is a strategic move, especially given the declining energy prices in the CEE region and current geopolitical uncertainties. In May 2024, we finally signed a project refinancing agreement for EUR 15 million with EBRD. This funding will undoubtedly provide a significant boost to the Group's expansion plans in Romania and the development of the capacity market offerings. Looking ahead, we believe that the achievements of this first quarter will not be undermined as they help us to leverage the strength of our business model and recover the overall growth and profitability of the Group in 2024. With the above changes in place, we feel more confident that we can promise a more positive trajectory for our Group's business in the coming quarters,"" said Georg Hotar, CEO of Photon Energy Group.

First Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights

In the first quarter, Photon Energy Group's consolidated revenues amounted to EUR 17.375 million, compared to EUR 19.280 million a year earlier, marking a decrease of 9.9% YoY.

Revenues from electricity generation reached EUR 3.746 million, a contraction of 9.7% YoY, primarily due to lower average realized electricity prices, which declined by 23.1% YoY, from EUR 173 / MWh in Q1 2023 to EUR 133 / MWh in Q1 2024. Although electricity generation increased to 30.2 GWh, up by 24.2% YoY, it was still insufficient to offset the impact of falling electricity prices.

Other revenues of the Group also decreased from EUR 15.129 million in Q1 2023 to EUR 13.629 million in the reporting period, down by 9.9% YoY, mainly due to weaker trading volumes of PV components. Other segments performed better than a year ago, particularly Photon Energy's New Energy division, which saw its external revenues increase by 120.5% YoY.

The Group's consolidated EBITDA of EUR 0.783 million more than doubled YoY, compared to EUR 0.330 million in Q1 2023. EBIT improved slightly to EUR -1.425 million, compared to EUR -1.569 million a year earlier. The Group's operating profitability was negatively impacted by the contraction of margins in the energy generation segment, lower volumes of PV component trading, higher personnel costs, and other expenses.

Depreciation increased to EUR 2.113 million from EUR 1.952 million a year earlier, attributable to the addition of new power plants in Romania. Interest expenses rose by 8.5% YoY, totaling EUR 2.678 million. The Group recorded a net loss of EUR -1.321 million, compared to a loss of EUR -4.170 million in Q1 2023. Other comprehensive income amounted to EUR 0.213 million, negatively impacted by foreign currency translation losses. Total comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2024 amounted to EUR -1.108 million.

The Company has published the full-year 2024 guidance, expecting revenues within the range of EUR 90-100 million, up by at least 27% compared to the last year, and EBITDA within the range of EUR 16-18 million, more then triple compared to EUR 3.7 million in 2023.

The Company is organising a video conference on Friday, 17 May at 11:00 a.m., during which it will present its results for the first quarter and answer questions. Participants are asked to send questions during the session via the chat function or in advance via email to ir@photonenergy.com.

""The first quarter of 2024 was marked by our continued efforts to make our business model more resilient to further economic and geopolitical fluctuations. First of all, we have managed to complete the rebalancing of our IPP portfolio which, as of 1 April 2024, represents a nearly 50/50 split between the support scheme mechanism, or FIT, and a merchant model, selling on day-ahead spot prices. Transitioning to a more balanced portfolio between the two schemes is a strategic move, especially given the declining energy prices in the CEE region and current geopolitical uncertainties. In May 2024, we finally signed a project refinancing agreement for EUR 15 million with EBRD. This funding will undoubtedly provide a significant boost to the Group's expansion plans in Romania and the development of the capacity market offerings. Looking ahead, we believe that the achievements of this first quarter will not be undermined as they help us to leverage the strength of our business model and recover the overall growth and profitability of the Group in 2024. With the above changes in place, we feel more confident that we can promise a more positive trajectory for our Group's business in the coming quarters,"" said Georg Hotar, CEO of Photon Energy Group.

First Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights

In the first quarter, Photon Energy Group's consolidated revenues amounted to EUR 17.375 million, compared to EUR 19.280 million a year earlier, marking a decrease of 9.9% YoY.

Revenues from electricity generation reached EUR 3.746 million, a contraction of 9.7% YoY, primarily due to lower average realized electricity prices, which declined by 23.1% YoY, from EUR 173 / MWh in Q1 2023 to EUR 133 / MWh in Q1 2024. Although electricity generation increased to 30.2 GWh, up by 24.2% YoY, it was still insufficient to offset the impact of falling electricity prices.

Other revenues of the Group also decreased from EUR 15.129 million in Q1 2023 to EUR 13.629 million in the reporting period, down by 9.9% YoY, mainly due to weaker trading volumes of PV components. Other segments performed better than a year ago, particularly Photon Energy's New Energy division, which saw its external revenues increase by 120.5% YoY.

The Group's consolidated EBITDA of EUR 0.783 million more than doubled YoY, compared to EUR 0.330 million in Q1 2023. EBIT improved slightly to EUR -1.425 million, compared to EUR -1.569 million a year earlier. The Group's operating profitability was negatively impacted by the contraction of margins in the energy generation segment, lower volumes of PV component trading, higher personnel costs, and other expenses.

Depreciation increased to EUR 2.113 million from EUR 1.952 million a year earlier, attributable to the addition of new power plants in Romania. Interest expenses rose by 8.5% YoY, totaling EUR 2.678 million. The Group recorded a net loss of EUR -1.321 million, compared to a loss of EUR -4.170 million in Q1 2023. Other comprehensive income amounted to EUR 0.213 million, negatively impacted by foreign currency translation losses. Total comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2024 amounted to EUR -1.108 million.

The Company has published the full-year 2024 guidance, expecting revenues within the range of EUR 90-100 million, up by at least 27% compared to the last year, and EBITDA within the range of EUR 16-18 million, more then triple compared to EUR 3.7 million in 2023.

The Company is organising a video conference on Friday, 17 May at 11:00 a.m., during which it will present its results for the first quarter and answer questions. Participants are asked to send questions during the session via the chat function or in advance via email to ir@photonenergy.com.

The Daily Tribune - www.newsofbahrain.com

In a move aimed at propelling its renewable energy and environmental protection efforts, Bahrain is set to revolutionise its wind energy sector with the introduction of an innovative wind turbine system.

The groundbreaking technology, developed in Hungary, harnesses the kinetic energy of airflow to generate electricity. Tamas Hovany, Chairman of Bahrain-Hungary relations, highlighted the significance of this development in an exclusive interview with The Daily Tribune.

""This unique system can generate energy even in minimal wind conditions while operating quietly and vibration-free. Its unparalleled efficiency and space utilisation provides a significant advantage over competitors. The system is easy to install and maintain, and it is resistant to dusty and sandy environments, making it an ideal solution for desert areas,"" explained Hovany, shedding light on the technological breakthrough.

Hovany went on to discuss the advantages of wind farms, stating, ""Wind farms already produce energy more efficiently than solar farms (22-24 percent vs. 14-15 percent) with older technology. However, with today's new technologies, their utilisation could exceed 30 percent.

Power plants

""Power plants do not need to be installed everywhere: the most valuable land should be exclusively reserved for agricultural production, while wind farms should be preferred on land of lower value due to significantly lower land requirements.""

He also underscored the importance of land utilisation in the renewable energy sector, stating, ""Wind turbines require little space, and agricultural use of the land under their blades is both allowed and feasible.

""An average and conventional wind turbine of 3 MW occupies up to 1,000 square meters (0.1 hectare) of land, which includes the wind turbine tower and its immediate surroundings. A solar power plant of similar size would require roughly 7-8 hectares of land, an area 70-80 times larger.""

Difference

He continued, ""This means that a 3 MW wind turbine can produce roughly one and a half times as much electricity in a year as a 3 MW solar plant - a difference of 120 times in terms of the unit of land occupied. Of course, this does not mean that wind power should be preferred to solar power in all situations and locations.

""For example, in protection zones around residential areas where wind power is not recommended or prohibited, solar power may still be the solution.""

Hovany concluded, ""We plan to introduce and manufacture this development in Bahrain, contributing to the global recognition and adoption of wind energy and other renewable energy sources, thereby promoting the Kingdom's advancement in the field of renewable energy and environmental protection.""",newsofbahrain.com,news,DT News,,0.419607843137255,453623414,7,https://www.newsofbahrain.com/admin/post/upload/A_QoqSTwti4R_2024-05-17_1715927125resized_pic.jpg,eng-9566306

May 16 (Interfax) - Ukraine's power system is experiencing a major power shortage for most of the day, with hourly blackouts expected in all regions from 12:00 a.m. on Thursday, Ukrainian media quoted NEC Ukrenergo as saying on social media.

The company's dispatch center informed the distribution system operators of the consumption limits for each region, it said.

The distribution system operators said on social media they suspended hourly blackout schedules from 9 a.m. and could introduce them from 4 p.m. until the end of the day.

In particular, Lvovoblenergo, Rovnooblenergo, Poltavaoblenergo, Nikolayevoblenergo, as well as DTEK, whose distribution system operators are operating in Kiev, and in the Kiev, Odessa, and Dnepropetrovsk regions and in the Kiev-controlled part of Donetsk region, have already said that there will be no schedules until 4:00 pm.

At the same time, CEO of Yasno supplier Sergei Kovalenko said the power supply was not stable.

""Yesterday evening, Ukrenergo revealed the limits that would allow us to work in line with the schedules, but subsequently they were adjusted several more times. In the morning, we hopelessly failed to meet the limits, so emergency blackouts were applied,"" Kovalenko said.

Ukraine persistently lacks power generation capacity and imports to meet the current level of consumption, he said, adding that he hoped for sparing electricity consumption to go through the evening peak without emergency blackouts, just with hourly schedules.

Due to the increase in consumption on Wednesday, emergency blackouts of industrial and household consumers in all Ukrainian regions had to be extended until 11:40 p.m. They were originally scheduled from 7:25 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Ukrenergo said.

At the same time, the emergency aid from the European Union countries has already been used from 12:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Thursday, Ukrenergo said. Meanwhile, the Energy Ministry said the aid would be also used during the evening peak hours and called for tight savings.

Electricity is being imported from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova in the total amount of 23,500 MWh, nearly reaching Wednesday's record high of 23,700 MWh. The maximum imports reaching 1,653 MW in some hours, which is close to 1,700 MWh, the maximum technical capacity of electricity supply from Europe to Ukraine and Moldova.

In total, 446 communities throughout Ukraine had no electricity for various reasons this morning, Ukrenergo said.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1294117647058823,453579860,10,,

The automaker is building a battery pack assembly line at the facility, and expanding the body shop, assembly and logistics areas. BMW has announced investment of 800 million euros to expand the production site.

BMW will build its Neue Klasse EVs at several worldwide sites -- production is to begin at Debrecen in Hungary in late 2025, in Munich in 2026, and in Mexico beginning in 2027. In line with its ""local for local"" policy, the BMW Group is locating high-voltage battery assembly facilities as close as possible to its vehicle plants. In addition to the site in San Luis Potosí, assembly sites for batteries are also being built in Debrecen, Bavaria, Shenyang, China and South Carolina.

""For our new sixth-generation e-drive alone, we are building five locations on three continents,"" explained Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management of BMW. ""Locating battery factories close to vehicle manufacturing makes production more resilient.""

The BMW Group will use its newly developed round cells in the Neue Klasse EVs. According to the company, the new cells will feature 20 percent more energy density than its previous-generation cells, enabling improvements of up to 30 percent in both range and charging speed.

BMW is increasing its use of on-site energy generation at its global locations. ""In Mexico, we are planning to expand the photovoltaic systems within the plant, to double the output from the solar panels,"" said Nicole Haft-Zboril, Head of Real Estate Management at the BMW Group. ""The plan is to generate more than 20 percent of the electricity we need directly on the factory premises.""

HOWDY. As we wrapped up this week's edition of EU Influence, we were keeping an eye on reports that Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was seriously injured in a ""politically motivated"" shooting -- thus we're dialing down the humor factor here a bit. (But we'll still snark a bit about some topics close to our heart. Read on.)

Q & A: CEFIC'S MARCO MENSINK

FROM ANTWERP DECLARATION TO DIALOGUES: The Antwerp Declaration was, by Brussels standards, the smash hit of the season. The February call for an industrial deal -- a companion (or, some say, a competitor) to the Green Deal -- drew Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo to a high-powered confab at a BASF plant in the Belgian port city. Now boasting nearly 2,000 signatories (mostly companies and organizations) from 25 sectors, the initiative is moving forward with a set of sector-specific dialogues -- including trade players, organized labor, NGOs, capitals and the Commission -- to get into the nitty-gritty of the declaration's 10 big asks.

Bubbling over: The swelling initiative was started by the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic). It already had one of Brussels' most complicated missions, juggling a kaleidoscope of chemicals subject to individual regulatory measures. Now its team is working to build up enough momentum to stay strong post-election, while keeping the structure informal and loose.

Gabfests: On Wednesday, IndustriAll spearheaded discussion to define quality work, with a biotech dialogue held Monday. (An energy and climate dialogue took place last month.) The aim is to present the conclusion of these Antwerp Dialogues to the Belgian presidency.

Cefic Director General Marco Mensink stopped by POLITICO HQ after a Berlaymont meeting Tuesday to talk about how the initiative has affected the trade association's work and its next steps. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity (we've removed a lot of the policy substance to focus on tradecraft).

How does this compare to Cefic's expectations when you first started talking about the Antwerp Declaration?

It's grown much bigger than we expected.

You can say that the Antwerp meeting was exactly at the right time and the start of a much bigger awareness on the need for an industrial deal. We started with 14 sectors; we started with 20 CEOs -- became 30, became 73, became 88. When 88 CEOs go on LinkedIn at the same time, pretty much every CEO in Europe saw the message.

Yeah. And of course, with the support of the Belgian presidency, who were in agreement. The same with [Enrico] Letta being there. And she confirmed like the week before.

Is there an overarching Antwerp Declaration infrastructure?

There's no central organization. There's also no funding of Antwerp as an entity. It's a group of like-minded people who signed up to the declaration. And we facilitate with the core group of sectors.

So after the declaration, when Eurelectric signed up and EFPIA signed up, they also took on part of the activities.

At the meeting itself not only were there the CEOs, but BusinessEurope was present with Markus Beyrer; Veronique Willems of SME United was there, Esther Lynch, ETUC, and Judith Kirton-Darling, together with Michael Vassiliadis from IndustriAll.

How has this affected Cefic, as an association acting as a secretariat?

It's like a snowball, and you start running and the snowball gets bigger and you keep on running, but you have to run faster and it gets bigger and you run faster again. So we've taken it in chunks. We started with a small summit, which became a big summit. It was the first time, as well, to work with the protocol of a president and a protocol for prime minister -- the security around these meetings, to start with.

The next day, and saw the amount of signatures, and had to reorganize the website, do checks of the signatures and put the team together. And then work on the dialogues. And what you see is that everyone on the team just jumped on it and got it done.

We went from, I would say, quite a strong trade federation to a whole new level through this exercise. It's been a lot of sweat equity. And we still have to do our own job. So there's a reason for also not making this into a fixed organization.

What you need, as well, as a trade federation, is a board that says, ""Make it happen. Go for it. And if this is possible, let's do it.""

Did you get any pushback from people saying, ""Chemicals are already super diffuse, we can't take on these things for all these other sectors?"" Was there any worry that you're gonna lose focus on Cefic's core mission?

Not at all, because first of all, it's come on top [of the regular work].

Secondly, if you look at our key asks, in the declaration, we need an industrial deal. And the reason is, you need to implement the Green Deal. We have until 2040 to decarbonize industry and get this done.

If you then look at the 2040 impact assessment, it talks about doubling of the electricity production in Europe. And industry investment has to be 6.6 times the historic average. And at this moment, we go into a downturn. And on top of that, you can see that neither the EU itself nor the member states will have the money to fund it, let alone fund it for everyone.

And that was the core of Antwerp. All the CEOs there said 'help us implement the Green Deal, help us get the investments.' And that was a very positive atmosphere.

Have you gotten any concrete promises out of this movement?

In Brussels terms, yes. If you see what's happened since: We had the stocktake document for the clean transition dialogue, which content-wise hits the nail on the head.

Then you see that translated into the European Council conclusions, which were very strong on industrial policy.

We're now going to see the translation to a next level in the COMP Council conclusions. You've seen it in the strategic agenda. I expect it in the political guidance of the Commission and the mission letters. I think that's the maximum we can do now in a period where there's no legislative agenda.

After the elections, what do you see happening with this movement? And how long is Cefic really going to play a central role?

It's important that the call for an industrial deal gets traction after the elections as well. That's a decision for von der Leyen in the end. That depends on the elections. That depends on her negotiations after the elections. But I think everything seems to be aligned to the certainty that defense will be a key priority and that industrial policy and competitiveness is a key priority -- and that the link between the two is called strategic dependency.

If that's with Cefic or not, I don't mind. I think the movement needs to move forward. Yeah. And of course, we'll do as much as we can to keep it on the agenda.

KILLING QATARGATE SLOWLY: Has the Qatargate investigation in Belgium been handled so badly that it deserves to be totally or partially canceled? Lawyers for most of the main suspects in the alleged cash-for-favors scandal were in court Tuesday to discuss procedural questions related to this fundamental question.

Election-week surprise: Belgium's competence in the case is likely to be on trial starting June 4, just three days before the EU election, my colleague Elisa Braun found out after taking a cappuccino in Brussels' Palace of Justice.

Welcome, third investigative judge: A year and a half after the police raids and bags of cash found in suspects' apartments, the picture is indeed looking a bit messy, to say the least: A third investigative judge has entered the picture as the second one has recently been suspended and the first one had to put himself aside because of conflict of interest accusations -- which Belgian authorities deny. The five-member police team is dealing with sick leave and regular attacks from the defense parties, and now it has to start working with a new set of prosecutors -- and, therefore, new methods. All this has massively delayed the case, which could ultimately result in a trial that will only see the day of light in six to seven years, several legal experts say.

Let the fun begin. Starting June 4, the Belgian prosecutor will defend the Belgian investigation for four hours. Following that, Eva Kaili's defense team requested three hours to make her case, Francesco Giorgi's wanted two hours and Pier Antonio Panzeri's wanted 30 minutes. It should be the first time they all talk publicly about the investigation in debates that are usually held à huis clos.

Shrouded justice: The European Parliament, which has joined the case as a victim, said that those debates shouldn't be public, according to opinions sent to all the parties and seen by Elisa. The request for public debates was put forward by Kaili, the ex-Parliament VP who is still fighting to be heard. Last week, she obtained the right to speak to journalists again and appealed a case in front of the ECJ that she had lost, her lawyer Sven Mary told us during a cigarette break.

What's next: After those public (or non-public) debates, top Belgian magistrates will say whether or not the whole investigation or parts of it should be binned. Among the main questions: Whether MEPs' immunity was breached, whether the alleged conflict of interest of a judge weighed on the investigation, and whether some evidence should be taken out of the case.

PFIZERGATE IN LIÈGE. An important hearing in the so-called Pfizergate case is to be held in the Walloon city of Liège on Friday. That discussion centers on who can handle the high-profile prosecution.

In case you needed a reminder: Ursula von der Leyen is one of the key targets here, along with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. Plaintiffs include Hungary and several other parties.

The matter: The European Public Prosecutor's Office (or EPPO) has taken over the case in recent months as it has the competence to lead investigations related to alleged misuse of EU money.

But, but, but: The implementation of EPPO's regulation in Belgium makes it difficult for EPPO to take over the investigation, and some of the parties also plan to debate whether the vaccine procurements include EU money, as previously disclosed.

ETHICS BODY

ETHICS BODY AGREEMENT SIGNED: Representatives of eight EU institutions -- minus the European Council president, of course -- signed the agreement to set up an inter-institutional ethics body. (Write-up here.) Commission VP for Transparency Věra Jourová laid out the timeline for the next steps.

June-September: Designation of members and alternates by the institutions (the Parliament will need to choose a new vice president for ethics in July or September)

By September 6: Appointment of the five independent experts (at which point institutions can ask for a consultation on conflicts of interest)

End of September-October: First ethics body meeting

January to April 2025: Agreement on common minimum standards ... after which point the institutions have to start implementing them.

A man's body? The family photo was a reminder of the gender imbalance at the top of the EU's institutions. With Parliament President Roberta Metsola and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde merely delivering video messages, that left Jourová the only woman available to appear on stage alongside Belgian Perm Rep Willem van de Voorde and the dudes in charge of the Committee of the Regions, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Justice, and the European Economic and Social Committee. Even Metsola and Lagarde sent men to appear in their place.

HARASSMENT HOLDING BACK WOMEN IN POLITICS: More insight on that ethics body sausage fest above: Women continue to be under-represented in the national parliaments and their share is growing at a snail's pace, Ketrin Jochecová reports. At the same time, gender-based harassment and hate speech is getting stronger, Director at the European Institute for Gender Equality Carlien Scheele said at a webinar on women in elections that took place on Tuesday. ""Women account for 1 out of 3 parliamentarians across the EU. Only 6 national parliaments had more than 40 percent of women MPs,"" said Scheele.

On a positive note: The EU has made advancements, such as adopting the pay transparency directive, European care strategy or the directive to combat violence against women. The number of women MEPs also increased in the last EU election.

However: ""Women hold only 32 percent of senior leadership roles in European politics,"" said MEP Radka Maxová (S&D), adding that there are huge regional differences, with Sweden being the country with the largest female representation in national parliament (47 percent) and Malta having of the smallest (15 percent).

AT THE RACES: MEP Hilde Vautmans, head of the Flemish liberals' list in the June election, is the latest EU lawmaker to face accusations of bullying her staff and misspending her salaries. But another detail from a Knack report (via the Antwerp Gazette) caught our eye: Revelations that Vautmans likes to use expensive VIP tables at show-jumping events as a chance to promote the EU and hand out swag. She's not accused of breaking any rules by doing this, but it's a venue that would surely also appeal to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whose team said she didn't have to disclose meetings with Vautmans' MEP Horse Group.

Funding policy: ""Our policy is simple: European funding,"" BIG co-founder and executive manager Sébastien Lumet said in an email. ""This means state funding only from European states. Donations, private and corporate funding only from organisations that are a) active in Europe and b) subscribing to the institute's objective to strengthen strategic culture. We will fine-tune this in the months ahead.""

A little confusion: Lumet added that BIG aims to preserve its independence by avoiding funding based on specific projects. Yet in another email, van Middelaar told us that in addition to EU country and institution support, BIG has ""limited funding from charities and corporate members, as well as some project funding.""

China Briefing handpicks and explains the most important climate and energy stories from China over the past fortnight. Subscribe for free here.

FIRST MEETING: The recently appointed Chinese and US climate envoys Liu Zhenmin and John Podesta met in Washington last week with an aim to build on the ""Sunnylands statement"" that had restored engagement between presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden at their summit last year, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. At the meeting, Podesta raised issues with Liu including ""Chinese overcapacity in solar and battery manufacturing, steel production and coal power"", according to Reuters, adding that ""the tone of the talks continued to be cordial"". State-run newspaper China Youth Daily reported comments from Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin saying that the US ""expresses willingness to strengthen cooperation with China in addressing climate change"".

100% TARIFFS: Just after Liu's US visit concluded, Biden announced significant new tariffs on a range of Chinese imports, reported Bloomberg. The outlet quoted Biden saying: ""When you [China] make tactics like this, you're not competing, it's not competition, it's cheating. And we've seen damage here in America."" According to a breakdown published by Reuters, tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) will quadruple to 100% (plus a separate 2.5% tariff), while solar cell tariffs will double to 50%, lithium-ion EV battery tariffs will increase from 7.5% to 25% and tariffs on critical minerals rise from nothing to 25% this year.

MEDIA REACTION: New York Times' columnist Paul Krugman supported the increased tariffs, saying: ""Why not just buy cheap Chinese batteries? Political economy...The Biden administration was able to get large subsidies for renewable energy only by tying those subsidies to the creation of domestic manufacturing jobs. If those subsidies are seen as creating jobs in China instead, our last, best hope of avoiding climate catastrophe will be lost."" However, another New York Times' comment article by economists Gernot Wagner and Conor Walsh asked the US to not ""slam the door on inexpensive Chinese electric vehicles"". Bloomberg columnist David Fickling commented that ""Chinese clean tech is not the enemy"", adding ""from all the talk of Chinese 'overcapacity' coming out of Washington, you might think that the problem of addressing climate change had already been solved...We'll need all [western nations'] industrial might - plus that of China, and a whole host of countries besides - to get there."" An editorial in the Economist called the tariffs a ""bad policy, worse leadership"", saying they ""will bring underappreciated economic harms to America and the world"".

CHINA REACTION: The Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said that the tariffs are the ""most typical form of bullying in the world today"", adding ""it shows that some people in the US have reached the point of losing their minds in order to maintain their unipolar hegemony"", Reuters reported. State-run newspaper China Daily quoted foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin saying that the US is ""making double standards by justifying its own subsidies and exports, while accusing other countries' subsidies and exports as 'unfair' and 'overcapacity'"". State broadcaster CCTV reposted a statement by the Ministry of Commerce which says that the US move is ""a clear example of political manipulation"".

PEOPLE'S DAILY: The Communist party-affiliated People's Daily published comments under the nom-de-plume ""Zhong Caiwen"", which is likely linked to the party's Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, on 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 May about China's manufacturing production capacity under the background of ""the US trying its best to exaggerate the so-called 'overcapacity' of China's new energy resources"". The articles claimed that the ""overcapacity arguments are designed to 'curb and suppress China's superior industries'"", ""ignore[ing] the benefits that Chinese products bring to global consumers"", while stressing the contributions China made to tackling climate change.

ECONOMIC DAILY: Meanwhile, state-run media outlets Xinhua, Guangming Daily and Economic Daily carried similar opinions. The Economic Daily, which according to its own introduction, plays an ""important role for the communist party's Central Committee and the State Council in guiding the public opinion towards economy"", ran the headline, ""Refuting 'the theory of overcapacity in new energy'"", on its 6 May frontpage and, ""Refuting 'the theory of overcapacity in new energy' again"", on the frontpage of 13 May. The two articles argued that the rapid growth in China is ""not blind expansion"", but is based on the ""urgent need to reduce global carbon emissions"" and that the US uses it as ""an excuse for more trade barriers"".

DOMESTIC FACTORS: Founder of H&S Capital and former news editor of BBC News Chinese Howard Zhang told Carbon Brief that this ""sudden media storm"" came ""at a time of rising discontent over economic downturn and huge youth unemployment [in China]"". He added that ""these anti-West reports help to divert public opinions and reinforce the government's conspiracy theory that the West, led by the US, is trying to 'stop China from rising up' and is trying to 'choke China off'"". Zhang acknowledged that China ""does have a point"", but added it was ""worth noting that these reports do not really report on Western concerns objectively and these reports are still mainly targeting the domestic audience"".

INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK: Isabel Hilton, founder of London-based NGO Dialogue Earth (formerly China Dialogue) told Carbon Brief that the reason behind China arguing its ""predominance in key industrial areas was not the result of unfair subsidies"", but because ""it is unlikely that either the EU or the US will allow important industrial sectors to be undermined in what they see as unfair completion, with all the political and economic damage that would follow. Hence, the Chinese need to argue that it is not unfair."" Hilton, a visiting professor at King's College London, added that a key point made by the Chinese media commentary was ""China's model of industrial development is no different from that of Western industrialised countries and that, further, they obey WTO rules and do not restrict or protect their own market...we can debate quite a lot of this, especially the market access point"".

OVERCAPACITY TENSIONS: On 5 May, president Xi commenced a five-day visit to Europe, which he began by meeting French president Emmanuel Macron and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Agence France-Presse reported. The newswire quoted von der Leyen saying the EU ""cannot absorb massive over-production of Chinese industrial goods"". In comments covered by the People's Daily, Xi responded that ""there is no such thing as 'China's overcapacity problem'"". Meanwhile, China and France signed the ""Sino-French joint declaration on strengthening cooperation on biodiversity and the oceans: Kunming-Montreal to Nice"", to deepen cooperation on biodiversity protection, People's Daily reported.

PRE-READ: Le Figaro published an article by Xi ahead of his arrival in France, in which he noted that Sino-French cooperation ""spearheaded cooperation in aviation and nuclear energy"". He added: ""Our two countries can deepen cooperation on innovation and jointly promote green development...The Chinese government supports more Chinese companies in investing in France. And we hope that France will ensure that they operate in a fair and equitable business environment."" State newswire Xinhua published an official English translation of the piece.

OTHER COUNTRIES: Meanwhile, Xi also visited Serbia and Hungary, where the South China Morning Post said he ""upgraded relations with China's two closest allies in Europe"". German chancellor Olaf Scholz did not meet Xi in person, but told journalists at a press conference that there are ""many overlaps"" between China and western automotive manufacturers, Reuters reported. State-run outlet Reference News quoted the German federal minister for digital affairs and transport saying ""we don't want to close off markets"" to Chinese EVs.

EU SOLAR PROBE: Following the EU's launching of a probe into Chinese solar companies last month, Longi and Shanghai Electric withdrew tenders to supply a Romanian solar park in ""the latest sign that the EU's new anti-subsidy powers are having a deterrent effect"" on companies suspected of receiving Chinese subsidies, the Financial Times said. It quoted the EU internal markets commissioner saying the regulation ensures ""foreign companies which participate in the European economy do so by abiding [by] our rules"".

NEW DATA: China's state broadcaster CCTV reported that China's electricity generation from wind and solar increased 25% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024. In the same period, electricity generated from coal declined. According to data from National Energy Administration (NEA), the total solar capacity in the first quarter of 2024 reached 45.7 gigawatts (GW), China Energy Net reported. In addition, China's low-carbon electricity capacity will be enlarged with the State Council approving the construction of a 2GW offshore solar project at Lianyungang city, economic newswire Jiemian reports. Once being constructed, it will connect with eight existing nuclear power plants and become a 10GW ""mega"" renewable energy project, added the outlet.

NEW RESEARCH: A new paper covered by Carbon Brief found that China's rising electricity demand can be met more cheaply through a combination of solar plus battery storage than by building new coal capacity. Carbon Brief also covered a study by the China Energy Transformation Program, a project under China's Energy Research Institute, that finds electrification, greater energy efficiency and a low-carbon power system could help China develop a net-zero emissions energy system by 2055, five years earlier than its ""dual carbon"" goal planned.

A new report by Australia-based thinktank Climate Energy Finance argues that China could reach its ""dual carbon"" climate goals earlier than planned.

Carbon Brief interviews the author of the report to find out more. The questions and their answers are edited for length and clarity. The whole interview is available on Carbon Brief's website.

Carbon Brief: Your report concluded that China's coal power output will soon peak and decline - despite rising coal capacity - thanks to the rapid rise of clean energy sources. How widely do you think that potential tipping point is understood, both within China and internationally?

Xuyang Dong: This potential is not being understood or acknowledged enough both within China and internationally. China is prioritising energy security over the need to reduce coal-use...Concurrently, China is increasing renewable energy capacity at a staggering pace that far outstrips every other nation on the planet.

Internationally, news headlines continue to emphasise that China is building new coal-fired power plants, leading to a lack of confidence about China's commitment to decarbonising its national electricity grid...However, the picture is more positive when we look at installed capacity. At the end of March this year, 53% of China's installed capacity was zero-emissions.

CB: If China is to announce more ambitious climate goals and expand renewable energy like you suggested in the report, in your opinion, what are the barriers?

XD: We are aware there are concerns over China's land use as a major constraint for building more wind and solar farms. We have run a case study on a 1.5GW solar project being built in the Tengger Desert in Ningxia Province. The project has 3.5 million solar modules installed, and only took up 0.1% of the total desert. In our model, we estimate that China needs to install a total of 5,405GW of new solar capacity to reach its dual-carbon targets and that may require only 11% of a total land area of the Gobi Desert, a neighbouring desert to Tengger.

The real challenge is that... more transmission lines are needed to maximise the renewable energy generation potential of China's desert areas, and to resolve China's land use constraints in the east coast.

CB: What do you think about policy support?

XD: I think being more ambitious in the overall climate target would be a good start... Considering its political system is ""top-down"", a more ambitious target could help the central government to give out more mandates, build better transmission lines and distribute the generated power into the areas that are needed.

Internationally, China needs to align with other developed countries to take its responsibilities as the leading renewable superpower, and the carbon price would be an important policy lever... A further driver would be for other nations to also catch up with China's staggering renewable expansion, and start to emulate its speed and scale, so there will be no excuse left for China to do less.

CB: What do you think about China's ""new three"" - solar, batteries and EV - and how they help China in energy transition and economy?

XD: The ""new three"" has played a very huge part in China's economic growth [in 2023]...I know there are a lot of concerns about this overcapacity in the industry, such as in the EU and the US, and I think for China to address the concerns over industrial overcapacity, it needs to, first, stimulate domestic demand and deployment of solar and wind farms, energy storage systems buildout and EV sales. Secondly, China could use its cheap renewable exports to help emerging markets and developing economies to build more renewable energy capacity, boosting and accelerating the global energy transition. Finally, it should be collaborating on joint ventures with European and US investors to build local factories.

NEA COMMENT: The Communist party-affiliated magazine Current Affairs Report published an article written by the head of China's National Energy Administration (NEA), Zhang Jianhua, about ""high-quality development of new energy"".

G7'S STRATEGIES: EU-China environmental cooperation specialist Arvea Marieni wrote a comment on G7's climate strategies for China's state broadcaster CGTN.

In April 2024, nearly half of cars sold in China were electric vehicles (EVs) or plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), which are known collectively as ""new-energy vehicles"" (NEVs). According to figures from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), NEVs made up 44% of sales in April, up from 34% a year earlier and just 4% during the same month in 2020.

It involved discussions on the development of the Black Sea submarine electricity cable project, intended to connect the grid of the region to those of EU countries and seen as important for energy security in the wider region and for the European Union.

""With this important project, Georgia has the opportunity to effectively communicate with the EU and have access to an important energy market. Also, our country has the opportunity to play an important transit role and help Europe with new, renewable energy in security issues through the supply of renewable energies of the Caspian Sea"", Economy Minister Levan Davitashvili said.

Discussions about the project continued during a face-to-face meeting between Davitashvili and Parviz Shahbazov, the Azerbaijani Minister of Energy, which highlighted the importance of the project for both of the countries.

The Ministry said the two officials also discussed the establishment of a joint enterprise involving four countries, with Bucharest, the capital of Romania, being considered as its location.

The Ministerial concluded with the signing of a ""special protocol"" on the further development stages of the project, with Davitashvili announcing the next meeting would be hosted in Bucharest.",bm.ge,news,bm.ge,,0.5215686274509803,453552198,1,https://bm.ge/uploads/files/2024/05/16/246989/ekonomikis-saministro_w_h.jpeg,eng-9579403

Lisa Doughten, Director of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' Financing and Partnerships Division, speaking on behalf of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that her Office recorded over 700 civilian casualties across Ukraine in April, including 129 deaths, a significant increase from March. Since 22 March, there have been five waves of attacks on the country's energy infrastructure, particularly in Kharkiv and Dnipro regions, causing rolling power outages and affecting millions nationwide. Moreover, attacks on ports are threatening their ability to export grain at a time of rising food insecurity.

Despite the spike in hostilities and the related risks, ""the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support"", she said. From the beginning of January until the end of March, 3.6 million people across the country received some form of assistance, and so far this year, 12 inter-agency convoys have delivered vital supplies to 20,000 people in front-line areas. Yet reaching civilians in areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- currently under Moscow's occupation -- remains a challenge, she observed, urging all parties to facilitate rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief to the 1.5 million people who require life-saving assistance.

Caitlin Howarth, Director of the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, said that 223 damage events across 23 of Ukraine's 24 oblasts were identified between 1 October 2022 and 30 April 2023. ""That's a rate of over 7 damage events identified per week, with peak impact timed for the height of winter,"" she stated, noting that these ""strikes of retribution"" -- as described by Russian Federation politicians -- mean extended periods without water, productivity lost, education fragmented and ""blackouts that last longer than the emergency batteries on life-saving health-care equipment"".

Against this backdrop, she asserted: ""As Russia's officials have comprehensively planned and executed their destruction of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, so should the international community systematically counteract this devastation."" She called on it to ""target the missiles"" through enforced sanctions; ""prepare for emergency"" by mobilizing resources today to ensure civilian survival this winter; and ""let Russia pay"" by releasing Russian Federation assets seized under global sanctions to fund these emergency preparations. ""Above all else, do not underestimate the scale of this threat,"" she stressed.

In the ensuing discussion, many delegates condemned Moscow's massive attacks on Ukraine's civilian population and infrastructure, noting that the worrying developments in Kharkiv Oblast demonstrate the humanitarian impact of the intensified hostilities. Several -- among them the representative of Denmark, also speaking for Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden -- expressed support for the upcoming first peace summit on Ukraine, which will take place in Switzerland on 15-16 June.

The representative of France observed that Moscow's attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity for which no impunity must be allowed. He welcomed the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued on 5 March 2024 against senior officials of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the campaign of missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure.

Guyana's speaker expressed particular concern about the continuing attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, stating: ""This cannot and must not continue"".

Calling for an immediate halt to ""this destructive campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" the United Kingdom's representative said that Moscow aims to terrorize civilians, obstruct livelihoods and businesses, and ultimately break down Ukraine's resolve. However, ""Ukrainians will not allow Russia to do that"", she said. She reiterated London's commitment of $55 million to the Energy Community's Ukraine Energy Support Fund, and over $214 million in overall support to the country's energy sector.

Echoing her sentiment, the United States' delegate recalled that his country recently announced $1 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, which includes urgently needed air-defence equipment. And since February 2022, Washington, D.C., has provided nearly $2.9 billion in aid to Ukraine and its neighbours -- including life-saving support for the 3.4 million people that remain internally displaced and the nearly 6.5 million refugees. The speaker for Sierra Leone called for fully funding the 2024 humanitarian response plan for Ukraine, while the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, pledged that ""the EU will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.""

The speaker for Poland said that the purpose of Moscow's barbaric actions is clear: to destroy the lives of Ukrainian people and make large parts of Ukraine uninhabitable. In this context, he voiced particular concern over the ongoing deportations and transfers of Ukrainian children and their forced ""Russification"". Slovenia's delegate noted the death rate of children jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year.

For his part, the Russian Federation's representative pointed to Western countries' failure to condemn the latest terrorist attack on 12 May, when the peaceful Russian city of Belgorod once again was targeted by a large-scale missile strike, killing 15 civilians. Western countries continue to provide long-range weapons to the Kyiv junta in ""the illusory hope of inflicting a strategic defeat upon the Russian Federation"". However, this will only prolong the Kyiv regime and cost the lives of tens -- if not hundreds -- of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians.

Ukraine's delegate said that Moscow launched a new offensive on 10 May, targeting the northern Kharkiv region with the immediate aim of taking the city of Vovchansk. While Ukrainian forces are holding the line to prevent Russian troops from advancing to Kharkiv -- the second-largest Ukrainian city -- he said that heavy defensive battles are under way, and the situation remains extremely dangerous for local civilians. Noting that Ukraine is now ""the only country in the world being attacked by ballistic and cruise missiles almost daily,"" he stated: ""The more active the world is now in restoring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine, the more likely it is that others in the world will not become the victims of similar aggression.""

LISA DOUGHTEN, Director, Financing and Partnerships Division, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, speaking on behalf of Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that her Office recorded over 700 civilian casualties across Ukraine in April, including 129 deaths. While 90 per cent of the casualties occurred in Ukrainian-controlled territory, strikes have also been reported inside the Russian Federation, including on Sunday in the Belgorod region, reportedly causing several deaths and damage to residential homes. Attacks on civilian infrastructure across Ukraine have intensified. ""Since 22 March 2024, the UN and its partners have seen five waves of attacks directed against the Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" she said. Kharkiv and Dnipro regions are particularly affected. The country's Energy Ministry reported that up to 250,000 residents have experienced rolling power outages in Kharkiv and ongoing restrictions in Dnipro since March.

Noting ""the stark impact of these power cuts on the most vulnerable"", she said that they have temporarily left millions of households across the country with no power, water or gas needed for cooking, heating and hygiene. ""Children who rely on online schooling are not able to learn. Older persons with mobility impairments, persons with disabilities who use wheelchairs or other assistive devices, and mothers with small children are unable to leave multi-story apartment buildings to access food and medical support,"" she said. She cited a new pattern of attacks on railway infrastructure in the east and south -- with OHCHR recording 10 such attacks in Government-controlled territory in April alone. Also concerning are attacks on factories and production plants, limiting the availability of locally procured humanitarian goods, and on port infrastructure, threatening their ability to export grain and other agricultural commodities at a time of rising food insecurity.

Reported attacks damaging energy infrastructure and oil refineries in the Russian Federation ""risk enflaming the war further and worsening its humanitarian impacts"", she said. ""The intensification in hostilities is making the delivery of humanitarian assistance all the more dangerous. Nevertheless, the UN and its humanitarian partners are doing everything we can to reach people in need of support, despite the enormous risks,"" she said. From the beginning of January until the end of March, 3.6 million people across the country received some form of humanitarian assistance, and so far this year 12 inter-agency convoys have delivered vital supplies to 20,000 people in front-line areas. Assistance has also included the delivery of health-care services to nearly 860,000 people, and emergency water supplies for over 1.2 million people. Humanitarian protection activities have been expanded, including gender-based violence support for people newly displaced by hostilities.

Commending Ukraine's Government for the extra support it has announced for survivors of conflict-related sexual violence -- in the form of financial reparations and medical and psychological assistance -- she said donors have so far given $669 million, 22 per cent, of the $3.1 billion needed under the Ukraine Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan. ""Another challenge remains reaching civilians in areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that are currently under the occupation of the Russian Federation,"" she observed, voicing concern over the estimated 1.5 million people requiring life-saving assistance there and urging all parties to allow and facilitate the rapid, unimpeded humanitarian relief. This war has caused the death and injury of tens of thousands of people in Ukraine, displaced millions, caused immense suffering and left more than 14 million people -- 40 per cent of the population -- in need of humanitarian assistance, she said, calling on the Council ""to seek an end to it"".

CAITLIN HOWARTH, Director of the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, recalling recent missile strikes on three thermal plants and two hydroelectric power plants in Ukraine, noted that -- by some counts -- ""near every single power plant"" has been targeted. Citing a report released by her Lab on 29 February 2024 documenting verified damage to Ukraine's power-generation-and-transmission infrastructure that occurred between 1 October 2022 and 30 April 2023, she said that 223 damage events across 23 of Ukraine's 24 oblasts were identified. She noted: ""That's a rate of over 7 damage events identified per week, with peak impact timed for the height of winter."" On 8 May 2024, almost 12 Ukrainian power facilities were reportedly struck in a single day and, since March 2024, successful targeting of power-generation facilities has further slashed Ukraine's capacity. ""Each hit compounds the problem,"" she observed.

She went on to point out that Russian Federation officials have clearly stated their objectives for targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure: first, to advance Moscow's military objectives; second, to retaliate for Ukraine's purported actions; and third, to inflict harm on civilians to compel Kyiv to submit to negotiations favourable to Moscow. She stressed that, while the first justification ""may"" be lawful under the law of war, the other two likely violate international humanitarian law. Further, while the Lab did not assess the degree of dual-use afforded by the energy infrastructure documented in its report, the law of armed conflict prohibits attacks on both civilian and military targets if the attack causes excessive civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects or a combination of these relative to any concrete or direct military advantage anticipated. Recalling a definition of Moscow's campaign by a State Duma member -- that it is aimed against Ukraine's ""whole energy infrastructure"" -- she emphasized: ""A comprehensive campaign, by its own definition, defies proportionality.""

She noted further comments by Russian Federation politicians that ""strikes of retribution"" on Ukraine's power infrastructure will make Ukrainians ""sit there without gas and without electricity and without everything"". Asking and answering what this means, she said it means extended periods without water, productivity lost, education fragmented and ""blackouts that last longer than the emergency batteries on life-saving health-care equipment"". Against that backdrop, she urged: ""As Russia's officials have comprehensively planned and executed their destruction of Ukraine's critical infrastructure, so should the international community systematically counteract this devastation."" To this end, she called on the international community to ""target the missiles"" through enforced sanctions; ""prepare for emergency"" by mobilizing resources today to ensure civilian survival this winter; and ""let Russia pay"" by releasing Russian Federation assets seized under global sanctions to fund these emergency preparations. ""Above all else, do not underestimate the scale of this threat,"" she underscored.

Statements

The representative of France said that the Russian Federation has shown no concern about its obligation to minimize injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. These practices may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity for which no impunity must be allowed. The International Criminal Court's arrest warrants issued on 5 March 2024 against senior officials of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Black Sea Fleet for the campaign of missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure are a decisive step. He also welcomed the renewal of the mandate of the Human Rights Council's Independent Commission of Inquiry, which documents indiscriminate attacks against Ukraine's populations and critical infrastructure. He noted that mitigating the humanitarian consequences of this war by strengthening the resilience of strategic infrastructure will be a key topic at the peace conference hosted by Switzerland in June.

The representative of Ecuador expressed concern over the continued suffering in Ukraine and risk to regional and global instability. ""The statistics are alarming,"" he said, citing increased intensity and frequency of attacks against essential infrastructure, the destruction of hospitals and schools, and attacks disabling several energy facilities this month, affecting millions of people's access to electricity and clean water. The impact of attacks in the Kharkiv region has been equally devastating, with numerous civilian casualties and a significant increase in internal displacement. Condemning these attacks, he declared: ""International humanitarian law is explicit in its prohibition of attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure."" The warring parties must adhere strictly to the principles of proportionality, distinction and precaution to avoid escalating this cycle of suffering.

The representative of Guyana sounded alarm over the unrelenting attacks on residential buildings, schools, medical and energy facilities and grain ports since the start of the war. ""These attacks were often unrelated to frontline engagement and appeared to have little regard for the requirement of proportionality and military necessity,"" she observed. She noted the international community continues to witness large-scale coordinated attacks on civilian infrastructure, including dozens of energy facilities, resulting in disrupted access to electricity and water supply for millions of people in multiple locations. They are not only causing incidental civilian harm through the disruption of access to critical services but also resulting in loss of civilian lives and injury to those in near-to-target sites. There have also been attacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, despite the many calls to end the attacks on or near the site, she cautioned, stating: ""This cannot and must not continue"".

The representative of Japan expressed regret that the Council heard another briefing ""about the many civilian casualties caused by the clear violation of the UN Charter by a permanent member of the Security Council"". Underscoring that attacks against civilian populations and infrastructure are ""clearly prohibited"" under international law, he also condemned Pyongyang's export and Moscow's procurement of ballistic missiles -- as well as the latter's use of these missiles against Ukraine. This transfer -- a clear violation of relevant Council resolutions -- supports Moscow's war of aggression and increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, he stressed, adding: ""We continue to monitor closely what North Korea gains in return."" He also detailed his country's support of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which includes the provision of two large autotransformers, six mobile-power-supply vehicles and five advanced gas turbines. ""Japan remains committed to supporting the Ukrainian people through bolstering the electricity and heating supplies in Ukraine,"" he said.

The representative of Algeria expressed grave concern about the destruction of civilian infrastructure, including energy and power plants. In addition, the worsening tensions and pursuit of hostilities have had dangerous repercussions on the international arena. He reiterated an appeal for diplomatic efforts to avoid a further humanitarian crisis and address human suffering without distinction. Civilians must be protected in line with the UN Charter and international law, including international humanitarian law. He called on all parties to set aside the mindset of confrontation and find what is needed to restore comprehensive and constructive dialogue.

The representative of the United Kingdom observed that this spring, the Russian Federation has targeted power plants, electricity sub-stations and gas storage facilities across Ukraine. Calling for an immediate halt to ""this destructive campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure,"" she said that millions of people already face disruption to power, heating and water supply. ""These attacks are making an appalling humanitarian situation even worse,"" she said, noting that this is especially the case for frontline communities, as the attacks and lack of power hamper humanitarian partners' communications and movements. This pattern of aggression continues in an attempt to terrorize civilians, obstruct livelihoods and businesses, and ultimately break down Ukraine's resolve; however, she stated, ""Ukrainians will not allow Russia to do that"". London has committed $55 million to the Energy Community's Ukraine Energy Support Fund and over $214 million in overall support to the energy sector in Ukraine, she added.

The representative of the United States said that the Russian Federation's large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure are a ""clear escalation"" that threaten critical services. ""Next week, this Council will be subjected to yet another meeting where Russia will claim that Western arms are to blame for prolonging the war it started,"" he noted, urging that Moscow ""need only look in the mirror"" to understand why more than 50 countries provided support to Ukraine's forces. In April 2024, the United States announced $1 billion in new assistance for Ukraine, which includes urgently needed air-defence equipment. Further, since February 2022, the United States has provided nearly $2.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its neighbours -- including life-saving support for the 3.4 million that remain internally displaced and the nearly 6.5 million refugees. He added that newly approved supplemental funding will help maintain the humanitarian response amidst ""unabated"" attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure.

The representative of the Russian Federation said that if Western colleagues were striving to convey to the international community at least ""an iota of the truth"" about what's happening in Ukraine, then they would not be sweeping it under the rug. Rather, they would condemn the latest terrorist attack on 12 May, when the peaceful Russian city of Belgorod once again was targeted by a large-scale missile strike. A residential building was partially destroyed by a missile launched from Ukrainian-controlled territory, killing 15 civilians. He also highlighted the culpability of Western countries that continue to provide long-range weapons to the Kyiv junta in ""the illusory hope of inflicting a strategic defeat upon the Russian Federation.""

On 20 May, the Council will discuss these destructive actions of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. In early May, the United Kingdom's Foreign Minister, David Cameron, made a revelatory statement that the weapons provided by London could be used to carry out strikes against Russian territories, including areas beyond the special military operations' confines. The formulas or plans advanced by the Ukrainian henchman and his Western sponsors are so divorced from reality. Any discussion on them will become a pure loss of time, and ""you will become complicit"" in prolonging the Kyiv regime, with the cost of this being tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of the lives of ordinary Ukrainians.

The representative of Slovenia noted that, since early April, over 1,000 drone and missile attacks were recorded across Ukraine, forcing thousands to flee as their homes are being destroyed. She noted a reported 140 educational facilities were destroyed or damaged in attacks across the country in 2024 alone. And according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the death rate of children jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year. She further condemned Moscow's use of cluster munitions in its bombardment of Odessa in late April, stressing that ""using such weapons in a densely populated area is against all rules of international humanitarian law"". ""These attacks seek to impair Ukraine's economy and are obviously not directed against military targets. This is a clear violation of international humanitarian law and it needs to stop now,"" she said, adding: ""Ukrainian civilians have suffered too long. We call on Russia to stop with its subversive actions and give peace a chance.""

The representative of Sierra Leone expressed concern that attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have resulted in major disruptions of essential services, such as electricity, water and gas to medical facilities, manufacturing industries and places of work for ""a significant portion of the population"". This slows production and reduces economic activity, and he also expressed alarm over the impact on health-care facilities -- including those with incubators and other life-saving devices. On that, he noted that such facilities ""in some cases had to resort to the use of batteries that ran out before the re-establishment of power -- putting the lives of many at risk"". Given the devastating impact of the conflict on the civilian population, he called on the parties involved to adhere to their obligations under international law to protect civilian populations and infrastructure -- including energy facilities. He also called for the full funding of the 2024 humanitarian response plan for Ukraine.

The representative of Malta noted the Russian Federation's aerial assaults against Ukrainian power generation and transmission facilities in several regions last week. This deadly trend encompasses daily drone, missile, rocket and artillery attacks in Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions -- ""yet another example of Russia's disregard for human life."" As of today, more than 800 heat supply facilities have been destroyed or damaged and the attacks have caused more than $1 billion worth of damage to the energy sector, she said, expressing full support for the important work undertaken by the Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

The representative of Switzerland condemned the massive attacks on the civilian population and infrastructure across Ukraine, which have killed and injured civilians in populated areas. Last week alone, several children were injured, and schools and a hospital were damaged, she observed, stating: ""As Ukraine fights for its future, all those who can build it -- including children -- must be protected."" Noting an increase in attacks on critical energy infrastructures, she said that, in total, nine regions across Ukraine -- including those far from the front lines -- have experienced disruptions to their electricity supply in the past week. In addition, the situation around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remains worrying. Determined to do everything in its power to contribute to a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, Switzerland will host the first High-Level Summit for Peace in Ukraine on 15 and 16 June, she said, stressing the need ""to define together a road map on how to involve both sides in a future peace process"".

The representative of the Republic of Korea underscored that Moscow's attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are unacceptable, as targeting such infrastructure violates international humanitarian law. He further stressed that, today, critical energy infrastructure ""holds far more significance in people's daily lives than decades ago"" when such law was created. In addition to hindering millions of Ukrainians' access to electricity in the short-term, the destruction of energy infrastructure has long-enduring impacts on the humanitarian situation in that country. A recent report by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) highlights a domino effect where such destruction leads to the disruption of other basic services such as water and sanitation. Noting that the lack of such services can impair the operation of hospitals and the viability of food production -- leading to the spread of disease, death and displacement -- he underscored that the Russian Federation's illegal invasion ""must end now to save lives and restore humanity"".

The representative of China said that his country is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it. It has long campaigned for peace and a political settlement. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. At the same time, the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously. In his recent visits to France, Serbia and Hungary, President Xi Jinping had an in-depth exchange of views with European leaders on the Ukraine crisis. China and Europe should work together to oppose the spillover and escalation of the fighting, create conditions for peace talks, and safeguard international energy, food security and the stability of the global supply chain. His country and France also agreed to seize the Paris Olympics as an opportunity to advocate a worldwide ceasefire.

The representative of Mozambique, Council President for May, spoke in his national capacity to highlight the devastating implications of the war in Ukraine for the humanitarian situation in the country. Noting that ""the prospects for a mutually accepted solution remain elusive,"" mainly due to the conflicting parties' firm belief in the primacy of military and zero-sum game logic at the expense of a cooperative approach, he underscored that the Council's consistent calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities ""can no longer be ignored"". Against this backdrop, he stressed the need to ensure the protection of civilians and to facilitate full, safe, rapid and unhindered access for humanitarian personnel.

The representative of Ukraine reported that the Russian Federation launched a new offensive on 10 May, targeting the northern Kharkiv region with the immediate aim of taking the city of Vovchansk. While Ukrainian forces are holding the line to prevent Moscow's troops from advancing to Kharkiv - the second-largest Ukrainian city -- he said that heavy defensive battles are under way and the situation remains extremely dangerous for local civilians. He added: ""Russian forces persist in razing Ukrainian towns to the ground without regard for the local population's suffering, with Vovchansk becoming the latest victim -- akin to Bakhmut or Maryinka."" Detailing numerous attacks committed by ""a country that called itself a friend of the UN Charter"", he noted that Ukraine is now ""the only country in the world being attacked by ballistic and cruise missiles almost daily"". Major cities have borne the brunt of these assaults, with devastating consequences.

""All the above crimes cannot be committed perpetually,"" he stressed, noting that a summit on peace in Ukraine will take place in Switzerland on 15-16 June. While stating that ""we have invited all peace-loving nations, and each nation can really bring peace closer"", he said that -- meanwhile -- Moscow intensifies its lies about ""a so-called peace deal that Ukraine and Russia were allegedly close to in spring 2022"". However, it is the Russian Federation President who has been ruining peace in Ukraine for more than a decade -- by occupying Crimea and parts of the Donbas in 2014, by obstructing the Minsk and Normandy peace processes, by launching a full-scale war of aggression and then by refusing to end it. Urging nations to attend the peace summit, he said: ""The more active the world is now in restoring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine, the more likely it is that others in the world will not become the victims of similar aggression.""

The representative of Germany said that the Russian Federation is attacking the foundation of the United Nations and global peace and security. As a nuclear State, it is invading its neighbour that has renounced nuclear weapons. By employing arms imported from Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it defies Security Council resolutions. To shield its illegal activities, it is dismantling instruments of this Council, such as the Panel of Experts for sanctions against Pyongyang. His country supports Ukraine with political, humanitarian and military means. Air defence systems supplied by Germany are actively helping to protect Ukrainian cities. Berlin has also invested in humanitarian relief efforts. The upcoming peace summit in Switzerland offers a unique platform. However, a just and lasting way out is only possible if Moscow renounces its objective of conquest and annexation, he stressed.

The representative of Estonia, also speaking on behalf of Latvia and Lithuania, said that every month, the Russian Federation uses over 130 types of missiles -- including those provided by Pyongyang -- over 320 Shahed drones and around 900 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine. As of late, chemical weapons can also be added to that list. ""These weapons are systematically used to kill and maim Ukrainian civilians, destroy homes, schools, hospitals and places of cultural heritage, attack food storage facilities and wipe out Ukrainian energy infrastructure,"" he stated. In total, Moscow's bombs have destroyed over 80 per cent of Ukrainian thermal power plants and 50 per cent of hydroelectric power plants.

He also highlighted that country's pattern of ""double-tap"" attacks targeting civilians and the rescue workers helping them -- ""the trademarks of Russia's aggression"". Accordingly, he underlined the need to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and the restoration of the energy infrastructure across Ukraine, noting that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have altogether contributed over $100 million worth of humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine and ""will continue to support Ukraine until the aggressor is defeated.""

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, underscored that ""every discussion on Ukraine must start by restating one unequivocal fact -- Russia's illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression constitutes a manifest violation of international law"". This is why that country must cease its attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure now, why its leadership must be held fully accountable and why all nations must come together in support of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine. Stressing that Moscow's indiscriminate attacks further exacerbate a dire humanitarian situation in Ukraine where over 14 million people require assistance -- ""you have heard so much about this here today"" -- he reported that the European Union has stepped up its provision of aid, including power generators and transformers.

The Russian Federation, however, has an obligation to allow such aid to reach all those in need, he said, also recalling the March 2022 legally binding order from the International Court of Justice for Moscow to immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine. He also stated that third parties must immediately cease providing material support to the Russian Federation's war of aggression -- ""or other kinds of cuddling"". Reiterating support for peace in Ukraine, he welcomed Switzerland's initiative to host a peace summit in June and called on all States to participate. ""The EU will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" he added and, to Moscow, he said: ""Stop your illegal war, and the illegal and inhumane means you are using to pursue it.""

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation is seeking to degrade the Ukrainian economy and society, making large parts of Ukraine uninhabitable. The purpose of these barbaric actions is clear: to destroy the lives of Ukrainian people and intimidate Ukraine and those who support it. In this context, he was particularly appalled by the ongoing deportations and transfers of Ukrainian children and their forced ""Russification"". Welcoming Switzerland's initiative to host a peace summit for Ukraine in June, he voiced support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace formula as a plan for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Ukraine and for the enduring security on the European continent.

The representative of Denmark, speaking also for Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, condemned Moscow's systematic and detrimental attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Noting that since 22 March 2024 there have been five massive attacks damaging over 80 per cent of Ukraine's non-nuclear power plants, she pointed out that this has included dangerous attacks on hydroelectric infrastructure which increase the risk of environmental disaster. She extended the Nordic countries' full support to the upcoming first peace summit on Ukraine in Switzerland, expressing hope that many countries will join. The Russian Federation's aggression and its detrimental global consequences ""demand united efforts"" firmly based on international law, including the UN Charter, and in line with Ukraine's peace formula.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,-0.2941176470588235,453549670,26,,eng-9568376

Rates have dropped from double-digit highs in 2022, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said in May that inflation was ""falling faster than initially projected and private sector confidence is improving"".

Yet for the European public, inflation's impact remains very real. ""I used to buy feta for €7-8 per kilo, now it's €14. Of course, I don't buy it at that price, I hunt for special offers and go to several supermarkets every week,"" says Maria, 63, who works as a cleaner in Athens. She says many Greeks have changed their shopping habits because of high inflation and now must shop around the city searching for bargains.

On the other side of Europe, Frédéric, who lives near Paris, is also hit by high prices. ""It's quite simple, my gas and electricity bills have clearly risen by an easy 35 percent"". The French accountant has started keeping track of his expenses in a spreadsheet to see where his money is going, and he sees that food and utilities have jumped the most.

The situation in the middle of the continent is even worse. ""People are buying spectacularly less and yet paying more. Many people are nervous and tense when they have to pay, some even swear,"" said Réka, a supermarket cashier in Budapest. No wonder, Hungary has the highest food inflation in Europe, with prices almost doubling since 2020.

Annual inflation across the EU reached a record-high of 11.5 percent in October 2022 (the European Central Bank sets a two percent target). Spiralling prices were triggered by the fallout from the Covid pandemic, the destabilising impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and flawed national policy-making. What's more, many prices have spiked further due to unchecked corporate 'greedflation' tactics.

It is of little surprise then that poverty and the cost of living crisis are priorities for voters in June's European elections, according to a Eurobarometer survey. Millions remain gripped by concerns about housing, jobs and daily expenses and far-right parties are among those targeting such fears on the campaign trail.

Jordan Bardella, candidate for France's far-right National Rally [Rassemblement National], has said purchasing power is ""one of the great untreated anguishes"" of citizens. ""Inflation is a wall in front of which millions of French people ... can no longer cope.""

After the Russian invasion, inflation was mainly fuelled by soaring energy costs, but by early 2023 Europe had adapted to its new energy supply. Food prices had become the main cause of inflation.

And now we have reached the point where the rise in the cost of services is the leading cause. As András, a hairdresser in Budapest, puts it: ""The landlord raised the salon rent at the beginning of the year with the official inflation figure, so that's why I'm raising the price.""

Not surprisingly, countries more dependent on Russian gas have seen the biggest increases in energy prices in recent years. At the same time, wages have not risen at a similar rate.

Only Belgium (2.9 percent) -- where wages are fully indexed on inflation -- and the Netherlands (0.4 percent) saw real hourly wages rise between the first quarters of 2022 and 2023. The fall in real wages ranged from 0.8 percent in Luxembourg to 15.6 percent in Hungary.

There are many reasons for this. A significant one is the lack of coverage of workers by collective agreements, according to Nicolas Schmit, EU commissioner for jobs and social rights. A recently adopted European directive sets a non-binding target of 80 percent coverage.

Schmit, who is running for the EU Commission presidency in June as the lead candidate for the Socialists & Democrats (S&D), believes that wage indexation, as in Belgium and Luxembourg, could be a solution but it has its limits.

In January 2023, Spain reduced VAT on staple foods from four percent to zero in an attempt to address its inflation crisis. This was a move that several governments have tried to do, including the Polish, Italian and Portuguese.

Another common measure to combat food inflation was the introduction of price caps, which Hungary took advantage of. Not with much success, because the supermarkets recouped the lost profits on artificially low-priced products by mark-ups on other products.

The Greek government found a third way. On supermarket prices, one of the most successful measures against inflation was the three-month ban on sales promotion of goods that recently had a price hike. Companies renounced price increases out of fear that they would lose market share.

With gas and oil prices spiralling out of control, almost all governments have also regulated fuel prices: sometimes with price caps (Hungary again), sometimes with rebates (Germany, Spain), and sometimes with VAT cuts (Italy, Poland).

While keeping fuel prices under control has helped both households and companies, subsidising energy prices has essentially only affected households, with full prices in place above a certain consumption. For businesses and entrepreneurs in need of large amounts of energy, this has been the biggest problem and has fuelled inflation. On the other hand, it left the most money in people's pockets, but it really cost governments a lot.

Inflation always hits the poorest hardest. Portugal and Italy have offered one-off subsidies to help the least well off, but they are in the minority.

The bleak reality is illustrated by how many people are now unable to heat their homes. Since 2021, the picture has worsened dramatically in most of Europe. In Spain and Greece one in five people cannot meet their basic utility needs.

""The other problem you have in Greece and in the European Union is that inflation is higher for those who have lower incomes,"" says Greek MEP Georgios Kyrtsos. ""Because they spend all their money on housing, energy and food.""

But the last two years were not bad for everyone. Many corporations and their shareholders thrived. France's top companies, comprising the CAC 40 index, celebrated a record-breaking year in 2023, with combined profits of €153.6bn.

According to the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), profit share increased across the EU by four percent since the start of the Covid pandemic. Dividend payments to shareholders rose up to 13 times faster than wages.

This can be partly explained by a blind spot in the measures deployed to combat inflation, namely the fight against 'greedflation', where companies exploit inflation to justify exorbitant price hikes, prioritising profit over consumer welfare. It can occur when companies anticipate increased production costs, and so they artificially raise consumer prices. Or when higher retail prices remain in place even if production costs come down again.

Already last June, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde sounded the alarm. She emphasised how certain sectors had capitalised on supply-demand imbalances and volatile inflation to boost profits. She pointed to the agriculture, construction and service industries for potential unjustified price increases, urging competition authorities to scrutinise the practices.

In the eurozone, recent inflation largely stems from higher profits and import prices. Profits contributed to 45 percent of price hikes since early 2022, according to a briefing last June by the International Monetary Fund. ""Europe's businesses have so far been shielded more than workers from the adverse cost shock,"" the authors assessed.

Greedflation is much stronger than wage-induced inflation, says French economist Jézabel Couppey-Soubeyran, for whom this phenomenon is also due to market concentration, which is an underlying trend, particularly in the energy, food, as in banking sectors. ""What we have seen in recent years is companies, particularly in the retail sector, passing on price rises in their selling prices. It's this problem that we need to take into account and try to limit. Member states have not really got to grips with the problem.""

French president Emmanuel Macron last year attacked the ""cynicism"" of those ""who make such exceptional income that they end up using this money to buy back their own shares"". He promised to implement a tax so that ""workers can benefit"" from the outsized returns.

Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis also denounced 'greedflation', telling companies that Greece ""is not a banana republic"".

But concrete action has rarely followed, and monitoring mechanisms are still inadequate.

Investigate Europe analysis of national policies found no clear steps taken to curb the phenomenon, except in the energy sector.

Back in 2022, the EU adopted an emergency regulation to address high energy prices, setting a mandatory temporary solidarity contribution on the surplus of fossil fuel businesses. But this ended in December 2023.

The contribution of profit to inflation ""had gone a little bit missing,"" the ECB president lamented to European parliamentarians. The reason, she said, is simple: ""We don't have as much and as good data on profit as we do on wages.""

There is no shared acceptance among political players that greedflation has strongly impacted everyone, says Ester Lynch, general secretary of the ETUC.

""I think the political persuasion and who governments listen to may explain this governmental lack of appetite to act against excess profits,"" she says. ""There wasn't that same acceptance that, by driving up prices, profit increases affected everybody. On the workers' side, we were adamant and pushing but there wasn't the same sense of urgency from governments.""

For his part, Schmit cautions against oversimplifying the issue. But he thinks corporations should pay their fair share and pay taxes on super profits to invest in the green transition and defence industries: ""We are talking about thousands of billions of euros if we take the figures for the next 10 years.""

Currently, there's a positive outlook: inflation has tapered off to around two percent from its 2022 high, largely due to declines in energy and food prices.

""The impact of tighter monetary conditions continues ... but global activity is proving relatively resilient, inflation is falling faster than initially projected and private sector confidence is improving,"" an OECD report released in May assessed. However, profits need to fall further if inflation is to remain around the two percent target, the European Central Bank said in an April analysis.

But another storm will come. Economist Jézabel Couppey-Soubeyran suggests that while inflation appears to be stabilising, it is premature to declare it over. ""If we don't fight against the structural part, namely against climate change and fossil fuel phase-out, we're going to remain exposed to price volatility,"" she says.

The European Parliament in December voted on whether to support a temporary crisis solidarity tax on ""undue and excessive profits"".

Opposition came mostly from conservatives and the far-right -- the same parties tipped for major gains in June's elections.",euobserver.com,news,EU Observer,,0.06666666666666665,453535871,10,"https://files-production-saulx-eu-observer-production-en-ci-hyp-xx0.based.dev/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,w=1200/fi8593a5a5/201fbddf-459f-4d82-8079-aa069ef6e477-74bba273-3767-46d0-bf56-8fc71d770cbf-16a56b2e-cedd-4996-8e12-951314c3b246.jpeg",

Skype, Bolt and Wise are among the household names to emerge from the tiny Baltic country. While Estonia remains on top of many European startup rankings -- it's not alone anymore. The neighbouring Lithuania and Latvia are catching up quickly, making the entire region an intriguing target for international investors.

As with the rest of Europe, however, the economic slowdown stunted the Baltics. In 2023, Baltic startups raised $517m, according to Dealroom - a 70% decrease from 2022. But in investors' eyes, the ecosystem is booming.

So, which startups could be the next to make waves in the Baltics? To find out, Sifted asked VCs from Change Ventures, Tera Ventures, Firstpick, Baltic Sandbox Ventures and Practica Capital. The only rule: they couldn't nominate portfolio companies.

Andris Berzins, Change Ventures

Change Ventures is a Riga-based pre-seed VC firm backing Baltic founders globally.

Pactum develops AI to automatically negotiate supplier contracts on a massive scale for big companies. Its system learns the value of contract terms and performs high-quality and considerate negotiations to reach a favourable outcome for both parties. The company has been on Sifted's radar since it raised $1.15m in pre-seed funding in 2019. Since then, it's raised $35.2m from investors such as Atomico and Project A, according to Dealroom.

Ovoko is an online marketplace for used car parts. It offers shipping across Europe and a 14-day money-back guarantee. It has teams in Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and Ukraine. In total, it's raised $21.2m from VCs like Lithuania's Practica Capital, Poland's Market One Capital and the UK's Piton Capital, according to Dealroom.

Patchstack is a cybersecurity startup which develops a tool that helps identify bugs and security vulnerabilities in web content management system WordPress' websites, plugins and themes. It's raised $2.1m in equity and grants, from VCs like Estonia's Trind Ventures and Honey Badger Capital.

Andrus Oks, founding partner at Tera Ventures

Tera is an Estonian VC investing out of a €45m second fund into pre-seed global startups. Tera has a focus on AI/ML and fintech.

GScan is developing a new kind of 3D-imaging scanner. It uses naturally occurring atmospheric radiation to make detectors, which are powered by subatomic particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere. The scanners are designed to create safe radiation that doesn't harm people in the surrounding area when scanners are used. The startup has raised $10.8m of equity funding and grants -- most recently a $3m seed round from Markus Villig, the cofounder of mobility giant Bolt.

Value.Space develops technology that allows for monitoring and detecting anomalies in large infrastructure objects -- think mines or dams -- thanks to the data gathered by satellites. The startup raised an oversubscribed $2.1m seed round from VCs including Helsinki-based Inventure and Shanghai-based Amalfi Fund.

KOOS is a legal and technological solution for giving non-employee contributors stakes in a business via virtual shares. Unlike actual or 'real' shares, virtual shares do not give holders ownership in a business but can be turned into cash upon a certain triggering event, such as a public listing or acquisition. Success is only shared when the business reaches its goals, however, so the service acts as an incentive for contributors to stick around and help the company grow -- like stock options hope to do for employees. KOOS has raised €4m from VC firms Plural, LocalGlobe and Superangel, plus angel investors including Entrepreneur First cofounder Matt Clifford.

Andra Bagdonaitė, partner at Firstpick

Vilnius-based Firstpick is an early-stage VC investing out of a €20m fund. It has a sector-agnostic approach and focuses on the Baltics.

Saltz is a platform that connects premium food producers and chefs from across Europe. Using the app, cooks can buy produce without middlemen or distributors, getting a broader assortment, lower prices and fresher products.

Evergrowth is an AI-powered sales platform. It provides sales teams with deeper, actionable insights into accounts and prospects, facilitating targeted and personalised engagements. It raised a €2m pre-seed round in February, led by US VC Impellent Ventures and Lithuania's Practica Capital, according to Dealroom.

Heavy Finance is a platform that connects small and medium-sized farming businesses with a global investor community to generate soil carbon credits. It's raised $5.7m from VCs like Lithuania's Practica Capital, Poland's Black Pearls and bValue, according to Dealroom.

Twenty years after Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the EU, their electricity grids remain synchronised with Russian and Belarusian grids, which means that electricity in all the countries has the matching frequency and can readily flow across borders.

The Baltic states have long planned to instead synchronise their power systems with the EU's grid, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made this an even more pressing issue.

""Grids are the heart of our energy system, and have big geopolitical and strategic importance. This has been underlined by Russia's devastating attacks against Ukraine's energy sector,"" the Estonian EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told Euractiv.

Simson also said that ""Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will become fully integrated into the EU's internal electricity market and gain full control of their electricity networks. This will increase the energy security of the whole region"".

The three Baltic countries agreed to set ""early 2025"" as the deadline for synchronisation with Europe's continental grid.

The European Union has invested more than €1.2 billion in subsidies for the project.

""Synchronisation is the most monumental energy independence project in the Baltic States and it is in its final phase,"" the Latvian electricity transmission system operator, JSC 'Augstsprieguma tīkls' (AST) told Euractiv.

The Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian electricity systems were integrated into the IPS/UPS transmission network during the Soviet occupation. This network, which is largely managed by Moscow, supplies 280 million customers with electricity, mainly in the former USSR countries and Central Asia.

In 2007, the then prime ministers of the three Baltic states agreed a strategic objective of joining the European continental grid. On 20 June 2019, these three countries and the European Commission signed a political roadmap to achieve synchronisation.

Riga, Tallinn, and Vilnius have put an end to their electrical isolation by building new interconnecting transmission wires with Finland, Poland, and Sweden. However, their electricity networks remain synchronised with the Russian and Belarusian systems (commonly known as the 'BRELL ring').

In contrast, the EU countries of Central and Eastern Europe - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, which had all also been part of the Soviet bloc until 1991 - already synchronised their systems with the continental European grid (CEN) between 1995 and 2004.

Synchronisation with the EU grid is planned via the existing transmission line between Lithuania and Poland (LitPol Link) and a future submarine cable between the two countries. Technical equipment must also be deployed, to guarantee the overall stability and security of the electricity system.

Latvian electricity transmission network operator AST told Euractiv the project is 'in the final phase of work', with the installation this month of three 'synchronous condensers' in each of the Baltic countries and the reconstruction by June of the two interconnections between Latvia and Estonia.

In July 2022 Lithuania's Vice-Minister of Energy Albinas Zananavičius announced the country's intention to speed up the transition process and leave the BRELL transmission system before 2025.

Vilnius successfully conducted an isolated operation test of the country's electricity system in April 2023, proving they are capable of joining the synchronous network of continental Europe (UCTE) as early as this year.

However, Estonia and Latvia require more time, and Lithuanian authorities have agreed to wait until all three countries are ready before achieving full synchronisation with the European grid.

In March 2022, the Ukrainian and Moldovan grids were synchronised with the European power system. While the 'emergency synchronisation' could be completed rapidly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the move was based on preparatory technical work which began in 2017.",euractiv.com,news,EurActiv.com,,0.1215686274509804,453528107,35,https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/shutterstock_1434482111-1-800x450.jpg,eng-9576905

Ukraine has been forced to introduce temporary blackouts across the country, affecting both industry and the local population, as it struggles with the aftermath of Russian strikes, the national power grid operator said.

In a statement on Wednesday morning, Ukrenergo said it had ""implemented controlled emergency shutdowns for industrial and household consumers in all regions of Ukraine,"" adding that critical infrastructure was not affected. It later clarified that the restrictions lasted two to three hours and did not apply to the Kiev-controlled part of Russia's Kherson Region.

""The reason is a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather,"" Ukrenergo said

The operator also warned the public that the blackouts would most likely be in the evening hours due to increased power consumption. In addition, there will be power limitation schedules throughout the day for industrial consumers on Wednesday, Ukrenergo noted.

This came after the operator introduced similar restrictions for industry on Tuesday, which were followed by controlled power cuts in the evening due to a spike in consumption.

To alleviate the pressure, Ukraine is importing energy from neighboring EU countries, including Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova, Ukrenergo added. A day earlier, the operator said its repair crews were making every effort to restore power, although in frontline regions the work is constantly hampered by air raid sirens.

The rolling blackouts come after Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba admitted earlier this month that Russian strikes had damaged half of the country's energy system. The Ukrhydroenergo power generating company said last week that its hydroelectric facilities had suffered ""overwhelming damage.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko estimated the combined financial losses from Russian attacks at more than $1 billion, warning that the figure would continue to rise.

Moscow has ramped up strikes on Ukraine's military and energy infrastructure in recent weeks. The Russian Defense Ministry said last month that the strikes were in response to Kiev's attempts to target oil facilities in the country. Moscow reiterated that the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations and never at the civilian population.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,-0.207843137254902,453514026,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1715778829.jpg,

Full transcript - EON SE (OTC: EONGY ) Q1 2024:

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE: MCO ). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil , and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",za.investing.com,news,Investing.com South Africa,Read Earnings Call,0.223529411764706,453513453,10,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/1af84873d4affc3cf00a793fcdf317a7_w_800_h_450.jpg,eng-9569582

Marc Spieker is set to move from his role as CFO to Chief Operating Officer, Commercial, with Nadia Jakobi succeeding him as CFO in June.

The company reported a slight increase in EBITDA and net income, attributing the growth to strong operational execution. Planned capital expenditures have increased by 25% from the previous year, in line with the company's investment strategy. E.ON also revealed the reorganization of its Energy Infrastructure Solutions business into a stand-alone segment.

E.ON SE (EOAN) has been making strategic moves, as reflected in their recent financial results call, and the InvestingPro data and tips provide additional context to the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro, E.ON's Market Cap stands at a robust 37.64B USD, indicating the company's significant size and influence in the energy sector. Despite the company's strong market presence, the P/E Ratio is relatively high at 66.96, which may suggest that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its earnings.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that E.ON has raised its dividend for 7 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 33 consecutive years, underscoring the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders -- a positive sign for investors looking for stable income. This is particularly noteworthy as the company transitions leadership roles and continues to invest heavily in capital expenditures.

The company's status as a prominent player in the Multi-Utilities industry is reinforced by its consistent performance and strategic positioning. However, an InvestingPro Tip points out that E.ON may have trouble making interest payments on debt, which is an important consideration for investors, especially when evaluating the company's increased capital expenditures and the potential impact on its financial leverage.

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE:MCO). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",uk.investing.com,news,Investing.com UK,,0.4823529411764707,453513417,10,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEBBR0PM_L.jpg,

Marc Spieker is set to move from his role as CFO to Chief Operating Officer, Commercial, with Nadia Jakobi succeeding him as CFO in June.

The company reported a slight increase in EBITDA and net income, attributing the growth to strong operational execution. Planned capital expenditures have increased by 25% from the previous year, in line with the company's investment strategy. E.ON also revealed the reorganization of its Energy Infrastructure Solutions business into a stand-alone segment.

E.ON SE (EOAN) has been making strategic moves, as reflected in their recent financial results call, and the InvestingPro data and tips provide additional context to the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro, E.ON's Market Cap stands at a robust 37.64B USD, indicating the company's significant size and influence in the energy sector. Despite the company's strong market presence, the P/E Ratio is relatively high at 66.96, which may suggest that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its earnings.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that E.ON has raised its dividend for 7 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 33 consecutive years, underscoring the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders -- a positive sign for investors looking for stable income. This is particularly noteworthy as the company transitions leadership roles and continues to invest heavily in capital expenditures.

The company's status as a prominent player in the Multi-Utilities industry is reinforced by its consistent performance and strategic positioning. However, an InvestingPro Tip points out that E.ON may have trouble making interest payments on debt, which is an important consideration for investors, especially when evaluating the company's increased capital expenditures and the potential impact on its financial leverage.

Iris Eveleigh: Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation. With that, over to you, Marc.

Marc Spieker: Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects. Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments. Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later. Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed. On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income. All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy. Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey. Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points. First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon. Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%. Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's (NYSE:MCO). As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025. Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs. Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers. We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions. Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time. Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note. We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands. Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

A - Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi: Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking. The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker: Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business. For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact. So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care. First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given. Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi: This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker: I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh: Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd: So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance. Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker: Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good. So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises. This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Deepa from Bernstein.

Deepa Venkateswaran: And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything. And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker: So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet. On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Deepa Venkateswaran: Just the court case could you comment.

Marc Spieker: Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst: Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker: So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance. And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers. And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh: With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn: I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker: Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time. And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

Iris Eveleigh: Next question comes from Piotr from Citi.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker: Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs. So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform. It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh: Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",investing.com,news,Investing.com,,0.4823529411764707,453513188,10,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEBBR0PM_L.jpg,eng-9569582

Hello, everyone. Dear analysts and investors, welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm here with Marc Spieker, for whom this will be the last earnings call as CFO before he takes over his new role as Chief Operating Officer, Commercial. Marc, thank you very much for our successful earnings calls together. At the same time, I'm excited to have Nadia taking over as CFO in June, and I'm looking forward to having her join the earnings calls from our H1 results onwards. As for today's call, as usual, we will leave enough room for your questions after the presentation.

Thank you, Iris, and a warm welcome from my side as well. I will save my goodbye words for later. Let us straight dive into the Q1 results, and let me start with highlighting the key messages for today. First message, Q1 came out in line with our expectations for all businesses. Key drivers of our slight EBITDA and net income increase, we're investing back earnings growth and strong operational execution more than offsetting the unwind of prior year one-off and timing effects.

Second message. Our planned CapEx ramp-up is progressing well. We have accelerated again our spending by almost 25% year-over-year and are well on track in terms of quarterly fill rates across all business segments.

Third message, our Q1 economic net debt came in as expected, showing the typical Q1 cash flow seasonality and the final outflows related to the unwinding of the positive one-off working capital effects that we have been reporting to you as of our 2022 results, and I'll come back to that later.

Fourth and final message, we have a strong conviction in the relevant and long-term growth path of our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. To make our ambitions more visible, we are moving the business into a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards as announced. Finally, our guidance is fully confirmed.

On to our Q1 EBITDA development. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at EUR 2.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year despite the lack of significant positive impacts from one-offs that we had seen in the prior year quarter. As expected, our Energy Networks business is slightly down in Q1 due to unwinding positive regulatory account effects of 2023, such as the benefit from lower redispatch costs, as well as slightly higher-than-expected costs from upstream networks in Germany. Additionally, we have changed the accounting for our Slovakian VSE business, to an equity consolidation, which leads to a technical reduction in EBITDA in our Central Eastern Europe business, no impact on net income.

All those effects are economically neutral and they were largely offset by strong RAB driven earnings growth across all regions and the positive uplift of regulatory parameters in Sweden. Regarding network losses, Sweden and Slovakia have now completed their recoveries, while additional recoveries are now only happening in Southern Eastern Europe. You may have noted that we have now split our reporting of the CEE and Turkey segment into Central Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. This shall give you more transparency on our geographically well-diversified portfolio of networks businesses. The Central Eastern Europe segment covers Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The Southeastern Europe segment includes our activities in Hungary, Romania and Turkey.

Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. New project commissioning is leading to EBITDA growth, as you would expect, supporting our 13% EBITDA accumulated average growth rate target from 2023 to 2028. This development is masked in Q1 by the absence of a positive one-off effect from last year and by changed intra-year maintenance schedule with a stronger focus on Q1 this year. With a change in maintenance schedule, we are partly mitigating also the negative effects from mild weather that we have been observing during the first quarter. In Energy Retail, the significant year-over-year EBITDA increase was primarily driven by positive price adjustments since Q1 last year. Additionally, we benefited from the improvement in our B2B segment in the U.K., which is successfully continuing its margin over volume strategy.

Those positive effects were partially offset by the lack of procurement optimization benefits that we had seen in Q1 last year and it's a very favorable commodity price background last year and lower weather-driven volumes in Q1. Corporate Functions and Other segments saw an expected slight EBITDA decline driven by the lower results from our Turkish generation business due to the development of commodity prices also in Turkey.

Moving on to our adjusted net income, which showed an increase of 2% which broadly follows the year-over-year EBITDA development. All earnings elements below EBITDA have developed in line with our expectations. The share of minority income sits at around 19% for the first quarter, as expected. And with that, materially below prior year. We expect this share to continue to go down and be lower for the full year as we communicated in our full year 2023 earnings release. Looking at the development of our economic net debt, I would like to highlight 3 points.

First, our promised CapEx ramp-up is being executed like clockwork. We increased our Q1 investment spending by close to 25% year-over-year. I can assure you that we continue to be fully focused on ensuring a frictionless ramp up, managing closely our operations and supply chains. So far, we do not see any critical bottleneck on the horizon.

Second, we have seen the typical operating cash outflow in Q1, which is driven by our seasonal business patterns in both Energy Retail and Energy Networks, specifically Energy Networks in Germany. As expected, this outflow was slightly amplified by the final unwind of our 2022 one-off working capital benefits. It's a long time ago, not everyone may remember, but our 2022 full year cash conversion set at a very benign 151%, significantly above the 100% we normally target. And as communicated in March for 2024, we are foreseeing a conversion rate of around 90%. And with that, the final reversal of these positive working capital effects from 2022 after 2024, we expect cash conversion to then swing back to the guided 100%.

Third message on END, our strong balance sheet position has recently been confirmed by 2 of our rating agencies. We have received a rating upgrade by Standard & Poor's and a full rating confirmation by Moody's. As communicated before, in line with our commitment to a strong BBB BAA rating, we have additional balance sheet capacity to fund further investments needed for a successful European energy transition if regulatory conditions further improve. Considering the balance sheet, it is also worth highlighting that we have already issued EUR 3.3 billion of bonds in the first quarter. With that, we have already fully covered our funding needs for 2024 and partially already prefunded 2025.

Moving on to Energy Infrastructure Solutions. As announced, we will report this business as a stand-alone segment from this quarter onwards. Strategically and with a view to future growth, this segment is all about exploiting the huge business opportunities from decarbonization and to a large extent, electrification of the heating sector. The segment comprises our activities in designing, building, owning, operating and optimizing sustainable energy infrastructure assets for cities and business customers. Our solutions are based on modular standard building blocks, which are configured and digitally connected to fit specific customer needs.

Technologically, our offerings include firstly, renewable on and offsite generation assets like photovoltaic and wind. Secondly, gas or biomass-fired heat and power engines. Thirdly, heat pumps and geothermal solutions. Fourthly, waste heat recovery technologies. And finally, high- and low-temperature heating and cooling grids. From a business point of view, we distinguish 2 clusters within Energy Infrastructure Solutions. First cluster is district heating and cooling, which is about running low-carbon heating and cooling networks in urban areas. Second business area is our industrial and commercial solutions business, offering on-site energy infrastructure for industrial and commercial customers.

We have decided to also include our U.K. smart metering business in this segment, while technologically, obviously different in nature, it is a quasi-regulated business and hence, of similar nature when it comes to financial visibility and resilience. Let me remind you of some more financial and business characteristics relevant for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions business. Geographically, we are present in 15 countries, the key ones being Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Our pan-European coverage and strong regional anchoring represent a unique advantage to address our customers' needs for locally optimized energy infrastructure. Our strategy to standardize our offerings in a modular way will allow us to scale our solutions.

Therefore, out of the EUR 5 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 years, 80% will be dedicated to growth investments. Through long-term contracts with customers, commodity price volatility and inflation are effectively passed through, for instance, via price escalation clauses. We ensure that any new project is targeted to deliver an internal rate of return spread over WACC of between 120 to 350 basis points. Furthermore, our rigorous focus on operational excellence ensures high asset availability. This is supported by digitalization, which helps to steer, monitor and effectively maintain and optimize the fleet of more than 6,000 assets. We expect annual EBITDA growth of 13% on average. Keep in mind that the municipal heat transition across Europe is still at an early stage. So there is more -- much more to come, but too soon for us to quantify what the impact will be over time.

Let me close today's presentation with Slide 8 what you essentially should take away from us today. First, extremely solid Q1 outturn supports our expected earnings delivery for 2024. Second, our investment ramp-up is progressing well, which fully underpins the delivery of our midterm organic growth targets. Third, our balance sheet remains very healthy. We will continue to focus on delivering an attractive total shareholder return based on value creative organic growth and an annually growing dividend per share. And with that, let me move to a personal note.

We announced in March that I would be moving on to take over as a Chief Operating Officer, the responsibility for our Energy Infrastructure and Retail Businesses from June onwards this year. We deliver what we promised. So inevitably, today is my last results call as CFO. It has been close to 8 years as CFO in the Board of Management of E.ON, hundreds of roadshows and exactly 30 results calls. I am not going away, but I will be focused on different things going forward. Great news for you is our investors and analysts that with Nadia Jakobi, I have the best successor I can think of. I know that with her, you, your interest and most importantly, your investments will continue to be in safe hands.

Dear Iris, I would also like to express my thanks to the best Investor Relations team I can think of. And finally, it has been a privilege for me to represent our company in the capital markets. I'm extremely grateful for so many deep and thoughtful conversations during roadshows and other formats. And a big thank you to all of you for that. Before we get too sentimental, there is still business to be done. So let's move on to our Q&A session.

Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, we will start our Q&A session. Let me remind you all briefly, as you all do know, please stick to 2 questions each so that most of you have the chance to ask the questions. If there's anything we can't answer today, then the IR team is always there to also answer further questions from you. With that, the first question comes from Alberto from Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi

Good morning, and Marc, thanks for all the help and all the best. We -- I guess we need to lean on you even more on the execution of all these EUR 20 billion CapEx plan. So congratulations, and thank you once more. Two questions on my side. The first one is a border line very boring, but can I understand, please, in the first quarter, what type of nonrecurring items we have in networks and in customer solutions. I'm trying to go to the underlying earnings power. So as I understand, you released some provisions. The weather was very mild, can you tell us if you booked negative and positive network losses, either recovery or cost? That is the first question. I have the feeling the underlying is stronger. That's why I'm asking.

The second question is I've seen a DSO plan that implies that potentially if feasible, which I understand from what you're saying is not, your CapEx plan could be 50% higher than what you presented in March. What underpins the plus 50%. Is it possible you give us a view on what assumptions we would have to flex to have even more investments. Is this driven by power demand, electrification, more renewables, data centers or just to have a fee for written.

Marc Spieker

Yes. So Alberto, let me start with the nonrecurring items. Compared to last year, we had a lot of positive one-offs. In Q1 this year is much less impacted by any one-off effect. If you look at our Energy Networks business, I think the remaining piece that we see here is a mid-double-digit million euro amount of final recovery for network losses essentially relating to 2022. So there's still a minor positive one-off in our Energy Networks business.

For Energy Retail, essentially, we talk about weather impact, which you may now call kind of extraordinary one-off or not. It's basically a -- it's a metric risk, which will hit us every year kind of in a positive or negative way in Q1 due to the mild temperatures, actually record mild temperatures. That was the second warmest Q1, I think, during the last 50 years. Not that I recollect that, but what the statistics tell and that was a mid-double-digit million euro negative impact.

So across both segments, then it's a wash net nil impact from one-off essentially. Your question to CapEx spend there is very valid. And with that, you're referring to a publication that we have also done about the initial allocation plan, which is kind of an exercise, which is regularly done by the DSO in close alignment with the German regulator, where basically, on a regular basis, we look at what are actually the political targets for renewables build or for development of the energy system. Germany specifically relevant Easter package, and then it's broken down in a technical way. So what are, if you implement those targets as they are written, what would technically have to be done in order then to allow for these targets to be executed. And in that sense, this 50% upside to which you referred to, is to be taken with special care.

First of all, it just reconfirms what we have been telling our shareholders also with our full year results that when it comes to our network growth plans, there is room for more if economic conditions are right. And this is what we are working on in that sense, there is no change to our communication in our plans that we will continue to be working with the relevant authorities to make sure that economic incentives are the right ones to support this, which is one of the constraints by the way, which this initial allocation plan does not include, but which by legislation is actually given.

Secondly, it is a technical plan, which does not take into account practical constraints. And we have seen these practical constraints, particularly playing a role when it comes to permitting, just to mention one, and it would be unrealistic in our view to now assume that they're technically possible in an unconstrained way can be delivered with all the constraints which we have in a practical way. And in that sense, what you should take away is there is a huge potential for E.ON to further invest and accelerate our investments over time. And as just similar to our results, we also have the financial means to do this if the conditions set by the regulators fit.

Alberto Gandolfi

This is very clear. So if you just allow me a comment. You've done essentially if it's clean for Q1, you've done 36% of the midpoint of your guidance in Q1. So it seems you're leaving an easy rest of the year to Nadia from here.

Marc Spieker

I take this as a statement, which I'm not commenting on. We move on.

Iris Eveleigh

Exactly. So we move on to the next question. Thank you, Alberto. Next question comes from Harry from Exane.

Harry Peter Wyburd

So 2 for me. First, can I dig in a little bit to what's going on in U.K. B2B supply. Why is it that you're earning so much, you made so much in such a short period of time? Do you think this is an industry-wide phenomenon for the whole of the U.K. supply market? Or is it just something that you're doing as E.ON? And can you just help us understand a bit what size of clients are driving this very good performance.

Are we talking about much smaller B2B customers or medium-sized, just a bit of color there would be very helpful. And second one is a bit more strategic and a bit of a follow-on from Alberto's questions on the CapEx. Is there any update or view from you on what your partners are doing or what others are doing in the German DNO market in terms of funding. Because I guess, if we're talking about an already upgraded CapEx plan potentially seeing even much more significant, more upside? And how are your partners going to fund this? And might we get into a situation where you're effectively incentivized to put your investment into your fully-owned DNO subsidiaries and not the ones where you've got partners because, of course, if your partners aren't putting capital in, it's harder for you to make a good return on your investment.

Marc Spieker

Just on the second one, when you are referring to partner, could you just specify what partners exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to our co-investors on some of the DSO or are you referring to the [indiscernible]? Okay. Good.

So let me start with the second question. We see across the board an extremely strong alignment between our interest and the interest of our core investors on a DSO level, which are larger municipalities for a number of our German DSOs and there is a very strong focus on all of our sites to make the energy transition work. And if -- also from a funding point of view to make whatever is there needed and possible also then on the level of the DSO side. And generally, we do not see a particularly constraint on that side or a clash of interest nonesoever. On the I&C business in the U.K., it follows our strategy where we had said that in most markets, we want to exit large B2B customers. So to your question, what are the customers? It's large I&C clients. This is not small, medium enterprises.

This is around large industrial and commercial customers. And the U.K. is the only market where we continue to run such a segment at scale. But this is why also strategically, we are very clear on that business, we'll have to be steered on margins and not on volume. So what we have been seeing this business doing is running on a smaller and smaller book and focusing more and more on those customers where we are able then to make a risk-adjusted fair margin if I look at the risk transformation that we're doing for these clients. I don't want to refer and can't refer now to whether that's an industry-wide phenomenon or not. What I can tell you that this is not a one-hit wonder, which has happened now in Q1. It is a development that we have been working for throughout the last 4 years with the continuous effort on managing our customer portfolio in that business.

And Marc, look forward to meeting you in person for your farewell events. So my 2 questions are actually centered around your German networks. So firstly, if I'm not mistaken, you were still awaiting for some more details on the current regulatory period. I was just wondering if you can update if there's been any change on the efficiency factors or anything.

And the second one was looking forward to the next regulatory period, there's obviously a consultation out from the regulator to move to back and reduce the regulatory period. And then there's also the live court case that you have for the current period. So just wondering how you think the negotiations will evolve? And should we assume that if you're successful in the court case, the regulator -- I mean is there quid pro quo between getting a better deal post '29 and leaving some money on the table for existing assets now? Or how would you think of this discussion.

Marc Spieker

So where do we have news and where do we essentially looking at the same time line with no -- is expected no further update. So first of all, what we have seen since the full year results is the publication of the efficiency benchmark. And the good news is that E.ON continues to be very efficient, i.e., 100% efficient operator. And I think that underpins our strategic relevance and the efforts that we are doing and continuously focusing on operational excellence also in our Energy Networks business. There hasn't been a further update on then the general efficiency factor. So -- and that stands on the efficiency front. We have now a public confirmation about what we have been working towards any or as an ambition to be fully efficient and we now need to see how the regulator deals with the general efficiency factor. Still, this has not been published yet.

On the consultation, then for the regulatory period starting 2028 for I guess '29 for power, no update essentially, Deepa that is worth relevant sharing here. I think what we continue to look at, first and foremost, is the proposal by the regulator. How to deal with depreciation schedules for existing gas networks. So this was one of the ideas expressed as part of the consultation paper where the regulator also pronounced that they were seeking there a fast solution. So kind of in the pipeline to expect is then a clarification by the regulator on how they intend to deal with existing gas networks, which is obviously also relevant for the energy transition in total. And for a lot of the market players, as you know for us gas networks has a very small share in our RAB but this is from a regulatory point of view, what we would expect to be the upcoming release. I think that's on the regulatory side.

Court case, also no update. So we haven't seen any -- there hasn't been any specific intervention with the court, no hearing, et cetera. So nothing to update on that side.

Iris Eveleigh

With that, we move on to the questions from Wanda from UBS.

Unidentified Analyst

Marc, all the best, again. Two questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, Energy Retail, you had a very strong start into the year. Q1 EBITDA accounts for 50% of the full year guidance. So do you expect any reversal later this year? Or is there any buffer included in the guidance, something similar to what you did at the end of last year. And if there is any buffer, would you be able to quantify it? And the second question is on the UK Retail. In March [indiscernible] launched a discussion paper for the future of price protection, the [indiscernible] collection is upcoming. How do you see the market structure changing as the current one, the price cut doesn't really work.

Marc Spieker

So 2024 guidance, Wanda. I think what I would stress is that we are back basically in normal operations. So while the last 2 years have been very much affected by energy crisis and kind of the relief from the energy crisis. We are now more or less back in normal mode. And I think where we can take confidence from is how well we have managed the first quarter, which has been extremely mild. And this double-digit -- mid double-digit million euro negative impact from weather for the second warmest quarter during the last 50 years. That is a quite good performance. But it's too early now to say at this stage what that means for the remainder of the year. So for our guidance, take that we are managing towards the midpoint as usually. And at this stage, there's nothing that I would flag where we are particularly aggressive or conservative in the way how we have set our guidance.

And apart from that, you always know that we deliver what we promise. So -- but the midpoint is what it is at this stage. On U.K. retail, there's not a lot that I would share now in this call except for that what we see is that the U.K. regulator has been much more constructive during the last years reacting to the industry's needs. Think we have also seen this -- of generally seen in Europe, the recognition also of retailers of being a system critical part of the energy value chain. And lastly, what I do see that E.ON specifically is being regarded by politicians and regulators as a company that stands in for the interest of customers and is driving the market to the benefit of the customers.

And this gives us also where there are conversations, I think weighted the relevance in being heard in these discussions. And apart from that, it remains what I've said in the past that the U.K. regulation is very little wiggle room now to become worse because if you look at the results, which many of the operators in the U.K. are still achieving, it's not a marketplace where you could now easily just step in as a regulator and believe that U.K. worsening conditions, I think this is still a game about improving conditions to make these operations economically viable.

Iris Eveleigh

With that, next question comes from Rob Pulleyn from Morgan Stanley.

Rob Pulleyn

I have one question, which is quite high level, Marc. And that is, how does E.ON see power demand over time, given, of course, in 2023 it remains significantly lower than we saw precrisis in 2021. Is this structural loss due to industry. What about electrification trends you've spoken about? And also more recently, the data center demand, which we covered on the full year conference call. So I'd love to know what you think is a good suggestion for the medium-term power demand run rate we should be thinking for E.ON from here across the decade.

Marc Spieker

Yes, Rob, it's a very relevant long-term question, but happy to address that. So fundamentally, we are positive about the growth outlook of electricity volumes in our markets. So we expect electricity long term to be on a growth trend. Now when we talk about growth trends in energy, in developed markets, it's never high growth rates, but what we are seeing and expecting is a growth of 1%, 2% annually over time.

And with that, of course, electricity will be the key carrier to replace then a number of primary fuels, specifically, you look at transportation, mineral oil, and if you look at heating mineral oil and gas. So growth outlook for electricity long term. And I think that is also important if you allow me that comment. If you look at the impact on affordability of the energy transition and then you should always keep in mind that all of these investments will be spread over time about much more volumes that will be wheeled in the system and increasingly bidirectional. So increasingly, our customers will also provide their power to the system. And so from that end, we are also confident that this will play out in a decent way.

I have 2 questions, really. So firstly, I wanted to ask about the B2B business. Is this just the U.K. situation? Or this is also visible -- I know you don't have exposure, but this is also visible in the German and Benelux market? And why you saw [indiscernible] exclude the option to participate if there are some opportunities. You see the tender where the margin would be extremely high, why wouldn't you participate if the situation is similar in the continent? And second question I wanted to ask about your retail customer. Where are we in the process of passing through the lower falling commodity cost to the end customer deals. So if I were a customer in Germany, what kind of a reduction can I expect for '25, '26 onwards. And that's the question.

Marc Spieker

Yes. Let me start with the second one, Piotr. So as you know, we are not giving a mid-long-term guidance on price development as we are a business that passes on the fundamental costs onto our customers. What we do see is that what is relevant for our customers, it's the commodity piece and it's the network charges. What we've seen for this year is from this essentially a stable price outlook. We have always different customer segments that will be then adjusted. We also have market-by-market different hedging windows, so the impact of that can be from a timing point of view, a bit different. But essentially, for example, look at Germany, we have seen very little price adjustments this year. And this is on the back of lower commodity prices and somewhat increasing network tariffs.

So all in all at this stage, limited impact. And then we need to see how commodity prices will develop over time but no further guidance as usual on how we see our end customer tariffs then moving. On the B2B business, we had actually been outspoken on that for the last 3, 4 years that we do not regard large industrial and commercial business as a strategically relevant segment for us. And to your question, therefore, in all other markets, we have moved out of that segment. So we are not running I&C retail businesses in any of the other markets. And the U.K. is the only one, and that is due to the specific situation of the Innogy integration and the Npower piece, which we had there, where we first focused on then kind of moving the E.ON and the Innogy business together on one platform.

It is actually from a branding point of view still running on the Npower brand in the U.K. And this is why this is our only material B2B position and hence, no real read across to any other of our markets, at least what would be relevant for us.

Iris Eveleigh

Thank you very much, Marc. And with that, there are no further questions in the round. So I'll take this as a positive that we are delivering what we promised, and we are well on track. If there's anything that comes up after the call, the IR team is always is there to also answer any further questions that may be. With that, yes, I will close today's call.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Sa Transcripts,0.3490196078431373,453503460,10,https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png,

In recent years, under the strategic guidance of the leaders of both countries, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been aligned with Hungary's ""Opening to the East"" policy, resulting in fruitful cooperation across various sectors.

Significant achievements have been made in green development areas such as new energy vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and photovoltaic products, injecting new impetus into the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Hungary.

The automotive industry is one of the pillars of Hungary's economy. More than 10 out of the top 20 global automobile manufacturers have established vehicle manufacturing plants or automotive component production bases in Hungary.

To embrace green transformation in the transportation sector, the Hungarian government launched an electric vehicle development plan in 2016. Chinese electric vehicle companies have been closely cooperating with Hungarian counterparts, and their brand recognition has been continuously increasing.

In April 2017, an electric bus factory of Chinese new energy vehicle manufacturer BYD in north Hungary's Komarom officially started production. It is BYD's first electric vehicle factory established in Europe.

In September 2022, Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO's first overseas factory was put into use in Biatorbagy, Hungary. The factory serves as NIO's manufacturing, service, and research center for charging products in Europe, providing local consumers with battery swapping stations.

In January this year, BYD set up a new energy vehicle production base in Hungary's Szeged, which is the sixth Chinese automotive manufacturing plant in Hungary and is expected to offer thousands of job opportunities.

""Hungary has a mature industrial chain for automotive manufacturing. While leveraging Hungary's advantages in the industry, we are bringing advanced manufacturing techniques and highly automated production lines to the Hungarian market from China, so as to support the electrification of the Hungarian automotive industry and promote technological exchange and innovation between China and Hungary,"" said an executive from BYD.

Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said that the automotive manufacturing sector is a pillar industry in Hungary, and attracting Chinese investment is crucial for strengthening Hungary's position in global new energy vehicle development.

Power batteries are key components of new energy vehicles, accounting for approximately 40 percent of the total vehicle cost. With advantages such as fast charging, long range, and high safety, Chinese lithium-ion batteries have become an important aspect of China-Hungary cooperation in the field of new energy.

In March 2022, Chinese lithium-ion battery company EVE Energy Co., Ltd. (EVE) announced a plan to build a factory in Debrecen, Hungary to produce cylindrical cells.

Five months later, Chinese battery manufacturer and technology company CATL also announced to build a battery plant in the city, which will become one of the largest battery factories in Europe once completed.

Additionally, other Chinese power battery companies and related material enterprises, such as SEMCORP, Huayou Cobalt, and Sunwoda, have also started building factories in Hungary.

The investment of Chinese battery companies like CATL in Hungary has stimulated the development of the Hungarian battery industry, and factories built by Chinese carmakers including BYD in Hungary have also promoted the development of the local automotive industry, said Andrea Nagyne Boda, head of the International Cooperation and Development Finance Department at the Ministry for National Economy of Hungary.

Hungary-China cooperation projects not only benefit the Hungarian people but also contribute to the entire Europe's enjoyment of the benefits of new energy, Andrea added.

Hungary's electricity import stands at around 30 percent. In order to diversify the country's energy supply, the Hungarian government has been actively exploring solar energy resources and developing the photovoltaic industry.

In June 2019, China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) under China General Technology (Group) Holding Co., Ltd., invested in a 100 MW solar park in Kaposvar, Hungary, which is one of the largest renewable energy facilities in Hungary.

Since its operation in 2021, the solar farm has generated over 140 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, which is equivalent to saving 45,000 tons of standard coal and reducing 120,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions on an annual basis.

CMC implemented a series of environmentally friendly measures when the solar farm was constructed. For instance, it replaced impact piles with spiral pile photovoltaic brackets to minimize land damage. It hired landscape experts for ecological planning and conducted large-scale greening around the factory area.

Kaposvar's mayor Karoly Szita said that the Kaposvar solar farm is not only an exemplary collaboration in clean energy between Hungary and China but also a testament to the friendship between the two countries.",newsghana.com.gh,news,News Ghana,People's Daily,0.1607843137254903,453495828,78,https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/A-worker-works-in-an-electric-bus-factory.jpg,eng-9565006

These have curtailed national debt and attracted foreign investment, thereby fostering the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.

Internationally recognized rating agencies, including Fitch and Standard and Poor's, have bestowed Serbia with a sovereign credit rating of ""BB+"" with a stable outlook, affirming its favorable economic trajectory.

In light of any apprehensions regarding potential risks, now is an opportune moment to weigh all the pros and cons. Admittedly, arguments against Serbia mirror those against entrepreneurial ventures in other European nations. Nonetheless, the affirmative arguments for Serbia are increasingly compelling and incontrovertible.

5 compelling reasons supporting the establishment of a company in Serbia 1. Serbia: A reputable non-offshore jurisdiction

The assertive deoffshorization measures pursued by most prominent nations have inevitably reshaped the dynamics and priorities of global commerce. The ambiguous zones characterized by minimal taxes and heightened levels of privacy are gradually dissipating, evolving into transparent jurisdictions. While this transitional phase may prompt a temporary capital outflow, it heralds promising prospects for the future. Legitimization and transparency emerge as pivotal trends in the forthcoming years, constituting indispensable elements for thriving business endeavors.

However, this paradigm shift also confers supplementary benefits upon business proprietors: Serbia stands wholly exempt from international regulatory blacklists and gray lists. This signifies that your enterprise will no longer encounter skepticism or impediments. You will be empowered to conduct your commercial affairs openly and boldly traverse leading global markets. Crucially, it's imperative to grasp that information exchange doesn't entail the wholesale disclosure of all your data into the public domain. Hence, a certain level of confidentiality is preserved.

2. Serbia: A bastion of steady progression

In August 2019, Serbia ratified the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation, colloquially known as the Singapore Convention. This pivotal step underscores the nation's steadfast commitment to fostering enhanced stability and predictability in international trade endeavors. As elucidated by the State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice of Serbia, this endorsement is poised to augment economic rights and opportunities while refining the business landscape.

Fundamentally, this development aligns with our earlier discourse concerning the burgeoning economic prowess of the country. The trajectory of consistent amelioration in Serbia's business milieu serves as a principal catalyst for attracting foreign investments, unlocking novel markets, augmenting existing ones, and fortifying infrastructure and financial institutions. This positive momentum engenders an influx of enthusiastic stakeholders, perpetuating a symbiotic relationship wherein all participants thrive.

3. Serbia: Striding Confidently Towards EU Integration

The Serbian government has reiterated its steadfast commitment to joining the European Union, accompanied by concrete actions and decisions to bolster this aspiration. Despite the protracted nature of the process since its inception in 2012, significant strides have been made, albeit without a discernible leap forward.

While occasional doubts may arise, the overarching trajectory remains resolute. Several members of the European Union, notably Hungary, have expressed unwavering readiness for Serbia's integration into Europe, underscoring a collective commitment to expedite this endeavor. It is noteworthy that the EU's apprehensions primarily revolve around the burgeoning influence of China in Serbia, alongside the amicable rapport with Russia, which thus far has refrained from imposing sanctions and continues to foster cooperation. This reiterates Serbia's allure for European enterprises and stakeholders.

However, a pivotal takeaway lies in Serbia's capacity to furnish a relatively swift and seamless pathway to accessing European markets. Today, owning a Serbian company opens the doors to the entire EU tomorrow. This consideration gains further significance for those inclined toward mitigating national risks. In this context, Serbia emerges as an enticing prospect. From securing a residence permit to pursuing citizenship and residency, the country offers avenues for minimizing potential risks.

4. Serbia: A Politically and Economically Neutral Haven

This aspect stands as another affirmative facet for entrepreneurs hailing from diverse corners of the globe. In the contemporary landscape, banks wield the authority to freeze accounts and impede business operations should you inadvertently become entangled in another round of sanctions or associated with sanctioned individuals.

Serbia maintains a stance of neutrality in international relations. As previously mentioned, the nation fosters amicable ties not only with the European Union but also with China and even Russia, a feat notable amidst the prevailing geopolitical complexities. While pressure from the EU has introduced a degree of complexity, establishing a company in Serbia nonetheless affords you the liberty to engage in business dealings with virtually any nation across the globe.

5. Serbia: A Leader in Minimal Company Maintenance Costs

Serbia stands at the forefront among European nations when it comes to minimal company maintenance expenses. Predominantly, the primary outlays encompass office rent and accountant fees. Rental rates commence at EUR 2,400 annually. Notably, the average salary in 2023 hovered around EUR 700, experiencing an upward trajectory in recent years.

Moreover, Serbia boasts a vast reservoir of highly skilled workforce, further enhancing its appeal as a business destination. Social and medical insurance contributions remain nominal and pragmatic in comparison to Europe. Additionally, Serbia exhibits favorable metrics in terms of electricity, gas, and fuel expenses, attributable to self-generation practices and advantageous contracts with suppliers. Furthermore, the corporate tax rate in Serbia stands at a competitive 15%, constituting a favorable proposition vis-à-vis the majority of European counterparts.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Led by lower food and auto prices, inflation in the United States cooled slightly last month after three elevated readings, likely offering a tentative sigh of relief for officials at the Federal Reserve as well as President Joe Biden's re-election team. Consumer prices rose 0.3% from March to April, down slightly from 0.4% the previous month. Measured year-over-year, inflation ticked down from 3.5% to 3.4%. And a gauge of underlying inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, reached its lowest level in three years. Inflation had been unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year after having steadily dropped in the second half of 2023.

Retail sales were unchanged in April from March as inflation and interest rates curb spending

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

The group writes in a report released Wednesday the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The senators say they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward but they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt the stakes were so high.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Stock market today: Wall Street rises toward records after inflation finally slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.9% higher Wednesday and above its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 270 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. But a stall in spending growth at U.S. retailers is keeping the gains in check. GameStop and other meme stocks are giving up some of their huge gains from the week's start.

Morocco's automotive industry shifts gears to prep for electric vehicle era

TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco has grown its automotive industry from virtually non-existent to Africa's largest in less than two decades. The North African kingdom supplies more cars to Europe than China, India or Japan, and has the capacity to produce 700,000 vehicles a year. Moroccan officials are determined to maintain the country's role as a car-making juggernaut by competing for electric vehicle projects. But whether one of Africa's few industrialization success stories can stay competitive as worldwide auto production transitions to EVs and increasingly relies on automation remains to be seen. Morocco's industry and trade minister says the government is focused on offering more than cheap labor to foreign automakers that are looking for outsourcing destinations.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

May 15, 1948, is a date forever etched in the collective memory of every Palestinian. We can't forget what happened in the leadup to that fateful day. During that time, the world witnessed one of the largest forced migrations in modern history. Palestinians call this day ""al-Nakba"" -- the catastrophe that resulted in the ethnic cleansing of nearly 750,000 natives and the destruction of more than 500 Palestinian villages and towns.

Seventy-six years ago today, the Jewish state of Israel was established and the Palestinian state of despair, homelessness, terror and daily suffering began. During the Nakba of 1948, my family was terrorized; they were displaced from their home in West Jerusalem and became refugees in countries that did not want them. I carry their pain with me to this day as I raise my voice in support of Palestinian rights.

Israeli historian and scholar Ilan Pappé wrote: ""Palestine was not empty and the Jewish people had homelands; Palestine was colonized, not 'redeemed;' and its people were dispossessed in 1948, rather than leaving voluntarily. Colonized people, even under the U.N. Charter, have the right to struggle for their liberation ... and the successful ending to such a struggle lies in the creation of a democratic state that includes all of its inhabitants.""

Palestinians had nothing to do with the Holocaust and had no role whatsoever in the European pogroms. Before the start of large-scale European Jewish immigration of Holocaust victims to Palestine, 94 percent of the inhabitants of the land were Arabs. The number of Palestinian Jews -- and, yes, they considered themselves Palestinians -- in Palestine at the end of World War I was less than 60,000.

The Zionists could not have succeeded in colonizing Palestine if it weren't for the support of Western imperial powers such as the United Kingdom and United States -- two countries that did not want Jews in their midst and put strict restrictions on Jewish immigration.

According to a recent piece by Harold Meyerson in The American Prospect, it was the enactment of the Johnson-Reed Act by the U.S. Congress on May 26, 1924, ""fueled chiefly by white Protestant xenophobic fear and rage at Jews and Catholics flowing into the United States,"" that left European Jews with no other choice but to go to Palestine. The Johnson-Reed Act is a federal law that prevented immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe in order to ""preserve the ideal of U.S. homogeneity."" Meyerson explains:

Not surprisingly, it was only then that Jewish immigration to Palestine began to soar, particularly after the Nazis took power in Germany and antisemitic movements and governments came to dominate Poland, Hungary, and much of the rest of Eastern Europe. The 3 percent of Jewish emigrants from Europe who were going to Palestine before the U.S. closed off its border soared to 46 percent from 1932 to 1939, as the Nazis took over Germany and loomed as a threat over the rest of Europe.

The Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt observed at the time that the European powers were attempting to deal with the crime carried out against Jews in Europe by committing another crime, one against Palestinians. She spoke out against it, since she felt it was a recipe for endless conflict. Zionist leaders, however, understood that they needed to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians in order to establish an exclusively Jewish homeland, and that the use of armed force against the Arab majority was essential for the colonial project to succeed.

More than seven decades later, Palestinians continue to be colonized; Palestinian lands continue to be confiscated for illegal settlement building; Palestinian family members continue to be separated from one another by walls; Palestinian communities continue to be forcibly displaced; Palestinian homes continue to be demolished; Palestinian farmers' olive trees continue to be uprooted; Palestinian children continue to be terrorized, detained and killed by the IDF; Palestinian refugees continue to be exiled; and Palestinians living inside Israel continue to be discriminated against. With the complicity of its greatest ally, the United States, Israel has not only continued but has intensified its inhumane policies of apartheid and violations of international law.

Nakba Day is about resisting erasure; it is about reminding the world that Palestinians worldwide are determined to keep our struggle alive. Its commemoration every year on May 15 serves as an important reminder that until there is an end to the occupation; until Palestinians get justice, freedom and equal rights; and until Israel adheres to international law, there can be no hope for peace.

Palestinians will also never forget Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the ongoing atrocities that Israel has perpetrated in response. As I write, Israeli troops have moved into Rafah, the safe zone that 1.5 million displaced Palestinians were sent to after they were ordered to evacuate northern Gaza. More than 500,000 Palestinians are said to be fleeing Rafah amid Israeli bombardment from the air, land and sea, moving from one hell to the next. A massive humanitarian catastrophe is about to get even worse. This escalation is a direct result of the Biden administration's unwillingness to end the genocide and its unconditional, ""ironclad"" support for Israeli actions, including its engineered starvation and forced displacement.

According to the Washington Post, the Biden administration notified Congress on May 14 of its plan to send yet another large arms package worth $1 billion to the Israeli state, which can be interpreted as giving Israel a green light for continuing its rampage and assault on Rafah. It will replenish tank ammunition, tactical vehicles and mortar rounds used up in Gaza over the past eight months, in contradiction to President Biden's announcement last week that he will consider withholding additional arms shipments if Israel assaulted ""population centers in Rafah.""

It is devastating to witness the ongoing Nakba with the latest nonstop bombardment of Gaza and the unimaginable suffering being inflicted every minute of every day on the now displaced Palestinian people of Gaza -- including those in the West Bank and East Jerusalem who are being terrorized by soldiers and armed settlers. The despicable, abhorrent and unjustifiable killing of so many innocent civilians is unfathomable. The children of Gaza are being starved at the fastest rate the world has ever seen.

My thoughts are with Gaza and Palestine -- with every breath and every heartbeat. The past eight months have been unbearable. I have cried over the loss of many friends: writers, artists and journalists I've worked with. I have cried over the total devastation of what was once home to over 2.3 million Palestinians. I have cried at the sight of fathers frantically searching for their families under the rubble and mothers holding their dead children close to their chests refusing to let go. I have cried over the older folks who are witnessing yet another massive intensification of the Nakba in their lifetime -- a Nakba that has already displaced them and rendered them refugees more than once.

The sheer cruelty of Gaza's forced, intentional starvation and Israel's blocking hundreds of trucks of food and aid from reaching the people is beyond comprehension. So is the Biden administration's refusal to demand a ceasefire and its use of veto power three times when ceasefire resolutions were introduced in the UN Security Council. The administration's enabling of Israel's genocide in Gaza will no doubt taint Biden's legacy with blood. Its building of a costly, temporary pier to bring in humanitarian aid instead of ordering the Israeli government to open the Rafah crossing and allow the safe passage of all the aid trucks amassed at the border is nothing short of nonsensical. This so-called pier project is estimated to take nearly two months to complete, during which time the death rate from starvation will keep rising with every passing minute. The construction timeline for the pier gives the Israeli Occupation Forces additional time to slaughter and ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza.

The destruction of the Al-Shifa Hospital (Gaza's largest medical facility) and the images of mutilated dead bodies of civilians and patients found after the Israeli Occupation Forces left -- patients shackled with their hands and legs tied -- was too painful to watch. The discovery of eight mass graves -- four at Al-Shifa Hospital, three at Nasser Medical Complex and one at Kamal Adwan Hospital -- with a total of 520 dead bodies recovered, including women, children and medics, with evidence of close summary executions due to fatal head and chest bullet wounds, is further proof of Israel's inhumane, genocidal practices that constitute gross violations of the Genocide Convention and international humanitarian law.

On Nakba Day 76, we continue to count: It is day 221; we are in the 8th month of renewed atrocities; the death toll has surpassed 35,000 with over 15,000 of these being children; over 79,000 are injured; 17,000 children are unaccompanied or separated from parents; 260 humanitarian aid workers have been killed; 493 health care workers have been killed; 142 journalists and media workers have been killed; 346 schools have been leveled; all 12 universities in Gaza have been flattened; two-thirds of the hospitals in Gaza have been destroyed; and countless children have died from starvation.

What is difficult to keep track of or quantify are the daily lies uttered by U.S. government officials and White House spokespeople in defense of Israel; the shocking amount of weapons shipments being sent by the U.S. to Israel, including 2,000-ton bombs that can wipe out whole neighborhoods; the billions of dollars of aid our government is sending to Israel without accountability; the depth of Western media's distortion of the Palestinian narrative and the level of its complicity in the genocide; the weaponization of antisemitism, and its conflation with anti-Zionism; the criminalization of dissent; the complicity of our educational institutions and the brutal crackdown on student protesters by riot police; the suspension of students and their disqualification from graduation for demanding that their institutions divest from weapons manufacturers, war profiteers and companies benefiting from and complicit in the Gaza genocide; and the heightened level of Islamophobia that allows for these horrendous genocidal massacres to continue.

Today, Israel's founding strategy of the forcible removal of the Indigenous population continues not only in Gaza, but also everywhere else in the occupied territories. For decades, Palestinians have been prevented from exercising their rights to freedom, equality and self-determination; for decades, they have endured horrific conditions of apartheid and brutal military occupation; and after decades, the hope of recovering even a small portion of their historic homeland has slipped away.

From the river to the sea, under occupation, in refugee camps, in the diaspora and around the world, Palestinians are a people who have been facing the brutal injustice of an apartheid Israeli regime for 76 years. I could have never imagined, in my wildest nightmares, the horrors we are witnessing in Gaza, in Palestine, and the complicity and active participation of the United States in the genocide of my people.

As we commemorate Nakba 76, let's sum up what is happening in Palestine: Israel was born of British colonialism; it was created through Zionist terrorism that displaced Palestinians and dispossessed them of their homes and land; it is supported -- financially, militarily and diplomatically -- by Western (primarily U.S.) imperialism serving war profiteers; and it is sustained by a combination of state terrorism and a system of apartheid that denies Palestinians equal rights -- Palestinians who form 50 percent of the people in the territory under Israeli control from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.

In short, Zionism is a settler-colonial ideology and political system that privileges one people over another and strives to ethnically cleanse and erase Palestinians from Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. This is the end game of 76 years of terror and ethnic cleansing. It did not start on October 7 and it is not about Hamas.

I am asked repeatedly to condemn Hamas by reporters that have been silent during much of our decades-long struggle against the brutal occupation and system of apartheid that denies our rights. Hamas is a resistance movement that began in 1987 as a result of the desperate conditions Palestinians have endured since the establishment of the state of Israel on their land in 1948. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed between 1947 and 1987 before Hamas even existed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist allies are using the pretext of the October 7 Hamas-led attack to fundamentally reshape Gaza and advance their plan of emptying it of Palestinians.

Israel does not want people to learn the truth. That is why its government has not allowed foreign journalists into Gaza. And that is why this month it passed a law banning Al-Jazeera from reporting from Israel.

Israel relies on the dehumanization of Palestinians, and the normalization of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is a nuclear-armed regional power whose politics have been shaped by ethnic cleansing and occupation of Palestinian lands. International human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have issued extensive reports concluding that Israel practices apartheid. UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Francesca Albanese has come under vicious attacks following her report highlighting Israeli settler-colonialism and apartheid and, especially, her most recent sobering report that said, ""There are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating Israel's commission of genocide is met.""

Racism in Israel is not a flaw in the system; it is the system. Hagai El-Ad, the director of B'Tselem, Israel's oldest human rights organization, said it clearly: ""Israel is not a democracy that has a temporary occupation attached to it: it is one regime between the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, and we must look at the full picture and see it for what it is: apartheid."" It is a colonial project that employs oppression, violence, persecution, checkpoints, house demolitions, displacement, expulsion, imprisonment, land theft, torture and collective punishment to ethnically cleanse non-Jewish inhabitants. It is not complicated. It is not an age-old religious feud. And it is not a conflict by extremists on both sides. Yet, our elected officials disregard all of this, including the International Criminal Court's labeling of apartheid as ""a crime against humanity.""

Gaza today is asking us an important question about what kind of a world we want our children and grandchildren to live and grow up in. Gaza has become the defining moral issue of our time: How many years of suffocating siege has Gaza endured? How many brutal invasions has it confronted? How many children have been left parentless and how many have been robbed of their mothers? How many have lost their homes, their farms, their orchards, their olive trees, their livelihood? This horror must end -- it is an injustice that has left people in crowded tent encampments without food, water, electricity or adequate health care; a devastation not seen in our lifetime; and a cruelty unmatched by any military in our time.

We are outraged because we are human.

The magnitude of global solidarity with Palestinians shows that people -- especially the younger generation, including the majority of young American Jews -- are no longer looking away. Across the U.S. and around the world, students and faculty have been engaging in a wave of protests and Gaza solidarity encampments on their campuses to demand that their institutions divest from companies that profit from Israel's apartheid and genocide. Despite the brutal crackdown by riot police and the arrests of over 3,000 protesters on U.S. campuses, the fearless students are inspiring others around the world to join their movement.

Here in my own backyard, 135 protesters, including two of my daughters, were arrested on May 7 at University of Massachusetts Amherst when the chancellor ordered the riot police to dismantle the encampment. I am outraged by the actions of the university administrators who, instead of protecting the students under their care, have put students' lives in danger by subjecting peaceful protesters to an excessive show of force that resulted in police assaults, violence and arrests.

Today, the students are the conscience of the nation. They are on the right side of history and are teaching their college administrators a lesson about freedom of expression and the right to protest -- a lesson that should be taught on university campuses by those who are attempting to silence the students and criminalize their dissent.

For us Palestinians, despite 76 years of mass displacement, ethnic cleansing and erasure, our connection to the land of Palestine is stronger than ever before. It's a link to our identity, to our Indigenous traditions and culture. Palestine will be safe in the hands of the younger generation. My children and my children's children will make sure that no effort or attempt at Palestine's erasure can succeed or withstand their collective will. I can assure you: We're not going away.",truthout.org,news,Truthout,Michel Moushabeck,-0.3098039215686275,453489142,1,https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/05/2024_0515-eid-lights.jpg,eng-9565434

Economic integration efforts among CentralAsian-Caspian Basin states are gaining momentum. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are developing a green energy plan to link their power grids with an eye towards exporting electricity to the European Union.

The energy ministers of the three countries announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding in early May to explore their joint electricity export potential by harnessing mainly wind and solar power. Kazakhstan is also aiming to boost its hydropower generating capacity. In outlining cooperation plans, the tripartite memo envisions the laying of a ""high-voltage cable"" on the Caspian Sea's seabed. Technical specifications for such a transmission line have already been developed, according to Kazakh Energy Minister Almassadam Satkaliyev.

""A proposed business model will be developed for the development of international transmission corridors (financing, revenue flow and ownership) and for the sale of green energy to the countries of the European Union,"" a ministry statement quoted Satkaliyev as saying.

The three countries have wasted little time in pursuing the plan. Satkaliiev said May 10 that a feasibility study was underway. He told journalists that the EU had given the budding consortium an expression of ""interest in purchasing clean electricity."" The feasibility study will work out construction and financing details and is expected to produce preliminary estimates by the end of the year. It is too early to put a price tag on the project, or the amount of power exports involved.

""We are talking about a fairly large amount of investment,"" Satkaliyev said.

The effort to foster trans-Caspian connectivity inherent in the tripartite memorandum dovetails with an economic blueprint proposed by the United States, dubbed the B5+1, under which Central Asian states take the initiative in breaking down regional trade barriers and forging new networks to boost trade and investment. Since the B5+1's inception in March, Central Asian states have taken steps to simplify trade rules. The tripartite memo marks a significant step in promoting regional cooperation extending beyond Central Asia to span the Caspian Sea.

The goal of exporting electricity to the EU fits in with plans unveiled by all three countries to significantly expand renewable energy generating capacity in the coming years.

The chief catalyst for power exports is Uzbekistan, which aims to generate an additional 20 Gigawatts (GW) via renewable sources by 2030. Meeting that target would raise the country's total renewable capacity to 27 GW. By April, the government had signed deals to develop wind and solar facilities projected to produce 12 GWs. In May, Uzbekistan entered into contracts for another 6 GW.

""Increasing the efficiency of the energy industry is relevant for our entire region,"" Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said during a Tashkent investor's forum in early May.

Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan seem destined to play more of a facilitating role in the power export arrangement. Given its abundance of fossil fuels, Astana's renewable goals seem more modest than Uzbekistan's. Kazakhstan currently generates about 2.9 GW of power via renewable sources, and hopes to add at least another 5 GW by 2030, according to Satkaliyev. Much of that capacity may be needed at home, however, as Kazakhstan grapples with a power deficit that saw the country become a net importer of electricity in 2023.

Azerbaijan has a target of generating 5 GW of solar and wind power by 2030. The MoU Baku entered into with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan potentially builds on a 2023 agreement that Azerbaijan concluded with EU states, including Hungary and Romania, to export power via an underwater cable traversing the Black Sea with a capacity of 1,000 Megawatts. The feasibility study for the Black Sea project was conducted prior to Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022, thus raising questions about its viability under wartime conditions.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,,0.1843137254901961,453488468,13,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2024-05-15_uvhy7ualbf.jpg,

Retail sales were unchanged in April from March as inflation and interest rates curb spending

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and put safeguards around it. The group writes in a report released Wednesday the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The senators say they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward but they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt the stakes were so high.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Morocco's automotive industry shifts gears to prep for electric vehicle era

TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco has grown its automotive industry from virtually non-existent to Africa's largest in less than two decades. The North African kingdom supplies more cars to Europe than China, India or Japan, and has the capacity to produce 700,000 vehicles a year. Moroccan officials are determined to maintain the country's role as a car-making juggernaut by competing for electric vehicle projects. But whether one of Africa's few industrialization success stories can stay competitive as worldwide auto production transitions to EVs and increasingly relies on automation remains to be seen. Morocco's industry and trade minister says the government is focused on offering more than cheap labor to foreign automakers that are looking for outsourcing destinations.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Morocco's industry and trade minister says the government is focused on offering more than cheap labor to foreign automakers that are looking for outsourcing destinations.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Slovakia plans to build a new nuclear reactor

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -- Slovakia's government approved a plan to build another nuclear reactor in a country that relies heavily on nuclear electricity generation. The government said Wednesday that a new reactor, with an expected output of 1,200 megawatts, is to be built at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant, where the utility Slovenske Elektrarne currently operates two nuclear units.

Retail sales were unchanged in April from March as inflation and interest rates curb spending

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Stock market today: S&P 500 flirts with its record after inflation slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.5% higher Wednesday and flirting with its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 134 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate this year, pushing Treasury yields lower. But a stall in spending by U.S. households tired after years of high inflation is keeping the gains in check.

Morocco's automotive industry shifts gears to prep for electric vehicle era

TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco has grown its automotive industry from virtually non-existent to Africa's largest in less than two decades. The North African kingdom supplies more cars to Europe than China, India or Japan, and has the capacity to produce 700,000 vehicles a year. Moroccan officials are determined to maintain the country's role as a car-making juggernaut by competing for electric vehicle projects.

Chief Executive Officer of HUPX Mátyás Vajta announced that a memorandum of understanding would be signed in days or weeks.

The cooperation between Elektroprivreda Srbije (EMS) in Serbia and its fellow electricity transmission system operator MAVIR of Hungary is about to enter another phase. Mátyás Vajta, CEO of Hungarian power exchange HUPX, told the audience at Belgrade Energy Forum that a memorandum of understanding on market coupling would be signed within days or in a few weeks.

It is the first task of Adex Group, he pointed out. The two TSOs formed the first regional electricity exchange operator with Slovenia's ELES and EPEX Spot.

""We hope that this will be one of the first, if not the first coupling between the EU and the Energy Community countries, serving as a pilot project, providing a good example of how this can be done in a smooth, fast and professional way,"" Vajta stated. The TSOs are running organized electricity markets through HUPX, Serbia's SEEPEX and the Slovenian BSP SouthPool Energy Exchange.

Market coupling with the European Union's single market is one of the conditions to exempt electricity generated in Western Balkan countries from the CO2 import tariffs under the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), until 2030.

Vajta said that, with renewables, the focus is shifting from the day-ahead to the intraday electricity market. In technology terms, most newcomers on HUPX are already trading only through algorithms, he underscored. Tackling the said issues in the region will be challenging, in the view of the head of Hungary's power exchange.

Market coupling is the key goal to focus on, according to him, while the CEO of Adex Group and BSP SouthPool Anže Predovnik expressed satisfaction that it finally became the next point to negotiate. In addition, the regional power exchange operator will help its partners in Montenegro and North Macedonia through the same process, he stressed.

There are four levels of decision making in market coupling: ministries, TSOs, electricity exchanges and national regulators, Predovnik explained and urged all sides to cooperate.

The moderator of the panel, Chief Operating Officer of SEEPEX Dejan Stojčevski, said negative power prices need to be allowed in Western Balkan markets to enable market coupling. Additionally, the Law on Value-Added Tax in Serbia must be changed so that electricity is treated as a service, he underscored.

May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,10,,eng-9563546

Ukraine has been forced to introduce temporary blackouts across the country, affecting both industry and the local population, as it struggles with the aftermath of Russian strikes, the national power grid operator said.

In a statement on Wednesday morning, Ukrenergo said it had ""implemented controlled emergency shutdowns for industrial and household consumers in all regions of Ukraine,"" adding that critical infrastructure was not affected. It later clarified that the restrictions lasted two to three hours and did not apply to the Kiev-controlled part of Russia's Kherson Region.

""The reason is a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather,"" Ukrenergo said

The operator also warned the public that the blackouts would most likely be in the evening hours due to increased power consumption. In addition, there will be power limitation schedules throughout the day for industrial consumers on Wednesday, Ukrenergo noted.

This came after the operator introduced similar restrictions for industry on Tuesday, which were followed by controlled power cuts in the evening due to a spike in consumption.

To alleviate the pressure, Ukraine is importing energy from neighboring EU countries, including Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova, Ukrenergo added. A day earlier, the operator said its repair crews were making every effort to restore power, although in frontline regions the work is constantly hampered by air raid sirens.

The rolling blackouts come after Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba admitted earlier this month that Russian strikes had damaged half of the country's energy system. The Ukrhydroenergo power generating company said last week that its hydroelectric facilities had suffered ""overwhelming damage.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko estimated the combined financial losses from Russian attacks at more than $1 billion, warning that the figure would continue to rise.

Moscow has ramped up strikes on Ukraine's military and energy infrastructure in recent weeks. The Russian Defense Ministry said last month that the strikes were in response to Kiev's attempts to target oil facilities in the country. Moscow reiterated that the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations and never at the civilian population.",europesun.com,news,europesun.com,,-0.2235294117647059,453478690,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1715778829.jpg,

Retail sales were unchanged in April from March as inflation and interest rates curb spending

NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans unexpectedly paused their spending in April from March as inflation continued to sting and elevated interest rates made taking on debt more burdensome. Retail sales were unchanged, coming in well below economists' expectations, and the figure followed a revised 0.6% pace in March, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. It rose 0.9% in February. That comes after sales fell 1.1% in January, dragged down in part by inclement weather. Excluding gas prices and auto sales, retail sales fell 0.1%.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Billionaire Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to buy TikTok

Billionaire businessman and real estate mogul Frank McCourt says he's putting together a consortium to purchase TikTok's U.S. business. The announcement posted Wednesday on the website of McCourt's Project Liberty initiative adds to the number of investors hoping to benefit from a new federal law that requires TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the popular platform or face a ban. Other investors, including former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have expressed a desire to purchase TikTok. However, TikTok's parent company ByteDance has already said it's not planning to sell the platform. The Chinese government is unlikely to approve a sale, especially not one with the recommendation engine that powers the videos that populates users' feeds.

Stock market today: S&P 500 heads toward a record after inflation finally slows

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising toward records with hope that inflation is finally heading back in the right direction. The S&P 500 was 0.6% higher Wednesday and on track to beat its all-time high set in March. The Nasdaq composite was adding to its own record and up 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 206 points. A report showing a slowdown in inflation is raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate this year, pushing Treasury yields lower. But a stall in spending by U.S. households tired after years of high inflation is keeping the gains in check.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Slovakia plans to build a new nuclear reactor

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -- Slovakia's government approved a plan to build another nuclear reactor in a country that relies heavily on nuclear electricity generation. The government said Wednesday that a new reactor, with an expected output of 1,200 megawatts, is to be built at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant, where the utility Slovenske Elektrarne currently operates two nuclear units. Slovakia generates over 50% of its electricity at two nuclear plants. The decision reflects recent nuclear expansion in Central and Eastern Europe, where the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are also planning new reactors.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer inflation in the United States cooled slightly last month after three elevated readings, likely offering a tentative sigh of relief for officials at the Federal Reserve as well as President Joe Biden's re-election team. Prices rose 0.3% from March to April, down slightly from 0.4% the previous month. Measured year-over-year, inflation ticked down from 3.5% to 3.4%. And a measure of underlying inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also eased in April. Inflation had been unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year after having steadily dropped in the second half of 2023. The elevated readings had dimmed hopes that the worst bout of inflation in four decades was being rapidly tamed.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

Stock market today: Wall Street unchanged ahead of new inflation and retail sales

Trading on Wall Street is muted early ahead of the U.S. government's latest reports on inflation and retail sales. Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both ticked up less than 0.1% before the bell Wednesday. The Labor Department will release its monthly update on consumer prices, or inflation faced by households. Economists expect the consumer price index to ease modestly to 3.4% in April on a year-over-year basis. A report Tuesday showed that prices remain stubbornly high at the wholesale level. The government will also release its retail sales report for April before the bell.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Slovakia plans to build a new nuclear reactor

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -- Slovakia's government approved a plan to build another nuclear reactor in a country that relies heavily on nuclear electricity generation. The government said Wednesday that a new reactor, with an expected output of 1,200 megawatts, is to be built at the Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear plant, where the utility Slovenske Elektrarne currently operates two nuclear units. Slovakia generates over 50% of its electricity at two nuclear plants. The decision reflects recent nuclear expansion in Central and Eastern Europe, where the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are also planning new reactors.

Wholesale price increases accelerated in April as inflation remains sticky

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. wholesale prices rose sharply last month, a sign that stubbornly high inflation may persist after three elevated readings in consumer prices to start the year. The Labor Department said Tuesday that its producer price index -- which tracks price changes before they reach consumers -- climbed 0.5% from March to April, after it dipped 0.1% the previous month. Measured year over year, producer prices rose by 2.2% in April, up from 1.8% in March and the biggest increase in a year.

Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again. Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year. Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.

Meme stocks are roaring again. This time may be different

NEW YORK (AP) -- GameStop and other meme stocks are roaring once again, surging to dizzying heights suddenly and sharply. Some things are different this time around versus the initial supernova for meme stocks that shocked Wall Street in 2021. The biggest change is it that it all feels a bit familiar now. Experts say that experience, plus some changes in the market, should allow Wall Street to more easily digest the sharp movements. But some things remain firmly the same.

The historic city marked the 104th anniversary of its union with Greece with a military and student parade that was attended by government and local officials as well as representatives of the Orthodox Church.

However, the raising of the Greek flag was the highlight of the day.

The capital of the Evros regional unit is the largest city in Greek Thrace and the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, with a population of over 70,000 and is an important port and commercial center for northeastern Greece.

The turbulent modern history of Alexandroupolis

During the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), it was briefly captured by the Russians. Ottoman rule ended with the First Balkan War, when the city was captured by Bulgaria in 1912. In the Second Balkan War, Greece took control of the city. With the Treaty of Bucharest (10 August 1913), the city returned back to Bulgaria.

With the defeat of Bulgaria in World War I, the city came under Greek control for the second time. In 1920, the city was renamed to honor the King of Greece, Alexander. With the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, Alexandroupolis became an official part of Greece.

A central attraction and symbol of the city is the Lighthouse (recognized as a cultural heritage monument in 2013) located on the city's promenade (Megalou Alexandrou Street).

It was built in 1850 and started operating in 1880, built on the western side of the city's harbor to facilitate the coasting of local sailors who traveled to the area of Hellespont.

It is on a cylindrical pedestal and is 27 meters from the average sea level and 18 meters from the ground, making it one of the tallest lighthouses in Greece. It operates with electricity and its distinctive feature is its light beam reaching 24 nautical miles (approximately 44 km) and three white blinks every 15 seconds.

Greek city becomes US, NATO and energy hub

The port of Alexandroupolis plays a vital role in the military presence of the US and NATO in Greece, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. NATO and US forces use the Greek city as a transit and logistic spot for troops that move to central Europe for training and exercises.

In addition, Alexandroupoli is becoming an energy hub for the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) at Alexandroupolis received the first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in February.

The FSRU is connected to the 28-kilometer-long high-pressure subsea and onshore gas transmission pipeline, which, once operational, will deliver natural gas to the Greek Transmission System (NNGTS) and onwards to the final consumers in Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Serbia and further to Moldova and Ukraine to the East and Hungary and Slovakia to the West.",greekreporter.com,news,GreekReporter.com,Tasos Kokkinidis,-0.1058823529411764,453473520,1,https://greekreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/largest-Greek-flag_Alexandroupoli_Credit-e-evros-TV.jpg,

May 15 (Interfax) - Emergency power cuts may again be introduced for industrial consumers and households in Ukraine if electricity consumption grows during peak hours from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., Ukrainian media outlets said, citing a statement published by the Ukrenergo power grid operator on social media on Wednesday.

At the same time, the power supply reduction schedules for industrial enterprises, initially due to last throughout Wednesday, have been shortened and are now in effect from midnight to 10:00 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to midnight.

According to Ukrenergo, there is a considerable power shortage throughout the day due to today's drop in air temperatures. Emergency assistance from European Union countries was used to cover it from midnight to 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday. Ukraine also expects to import an all-time high of 23,692 MWh of electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova on Wednesday versus 21,070 MWh on Tuesday. Maximum capacity reaches 1,628 MW in certain hours, nearing the 1,700 MWh technical capacity for electricity imports by Ukraine and Moldova from Europe, it said.

Ukrenergo has called on consumers to use electricity sparingly throughout the day, especially in peak hours from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., the company's press service told journalists.

YASNO electricity supplier CEO Sergei Kovalenko, in turn, said on social media that it is wrong to make businesses bear the brunt of the power shortages, because it is highly important to enable enterprises to continue to function and produce GDP.

A total of 418 populated localities across Ukraine remained without electricity for various reasons on Wednesday morning, Ukrenergo said.

As reported, Ukrenergo introduced emergency power cuts for industrial consumers and households on Tuesday evening and on Wednesday morning due to electricity shortages after power consumption grew following a drop in air temperatures. Almost day-to-day supply reduction schedules have been in effect for industrial enterprises since May 8. Power shortages have been covered by imports and daily lengthy emergency assistance from neighboring countries.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.192156862745098,453470181,20,,eng-9567972

In a statement on Wednesday morning, Ukrenergo said it had ""implemented controlled emergency shutdowns for industrial and household consumers in all regions of Ukraine,"" adding that critical infrastructure was not affected. It later clarified that the restrictions lasted two to three hours and did not apply to the Kiev-controlled part of Russia's Kherson Region.

""The reason is a significant shortage of electricity in the system due to Russian shelling and an increase in consumption due to the cold weather,"" Ukrenergo said

The operator also warned the public that the blackouts would most likely be in the evening hours due to increased power consumption. In addition, there will be power limitation schedules throughout the day for industrial consumers on Wednesday, Ukrenergo noted.

This came after the operator introduced similar restrictions for industry on Tuesday, which were followed by controlled power cuts in the evening due to a spike in consumption.

To alleviate the pressure, Ukraine is importing energy from neighboring EU countries, including Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova, Ukrenergo added. A day earlier, the operator said its repair crews were making every effort to restore power, although in frontline regions the work is constantly hampered by air raid sirens.

The rolling blackouts come after Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba admitted earlier this month that Russian strikes had damaged half of the country's energy system. The Ukrhydroenergo power generating company said last week that its hydroelectric facilities had suffered ""overwhelming damage.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko estimated the combined financial losses from Russian attacks at more than $1 billion, warning that the figure would continue to rise.

Moscow has ramped up strikes on Ukraine's military and energy infrastructure in recent weeks. The Russian Defense Ministry said last month that the strikes were in response to Kiev's attempts to target oil facilities in the country. Moscow reiterated that the attacks are only aimed at Ukrainian military targets and facilities that support their operations and never at the civilian population.",rt.com,news,RT,,-0.1686274509803921,453470163,1,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/66449fa985f5402a30558023.jpg,eng-9567972

WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's perhaps the biggest question swirling around the U.S. economy right now: Is inflation stuck at an elevated level -- or will last year's steady decline resume sometime soon? On Wednesday, the government will issue the latest monthly inflation report, a set of figures that will be scrutinized by economists, Wall Street traders and Federal Reserve officials for any insight into that question. Analysts estimate that year-over-year inflation dipped from 3.5% in March to 3.4% in April. Measured from March to April, consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.4%, the same as in the previous month.

Senators urge $32 billion in emergency spending on AI after finishing yearlong review

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of four senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is recommending that Congress spend at least $32 billion over the next three years to develop artificial intelligence and also put safeguards around it. The group wrote in a new report released Wednesday that the U.S. needs to ""harness the opportunities and address the risks"" of the quickly developing technology. The group says they sometimes disagreed on the best paths forward, but that they eventually found consensus on policy recommendations included in the 33-page report because they felt that the stakes were so high.

Labor laws largely exclude nannies. Some are banding together to protect themselves

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nannies, housekeepers, and home care workers are excluded from many federal workplace protections in the United States, and the private, home-based nature of the work means abuse tends to happen behind closed doors. Domestic workers, who make less than half of what a typical worker makes and are disproportionately women and immigrant women, are especially vulnerable to workplace violations and discrimination, experts say. Even in the 11 states with laws on the books that protect domestic workers, those often go unenforced. But nannies across the nation are lobbying lawmakers for better protections and training their peers on how to exercise their rights.

Justice Department says Boeing violated deal that avoided prosecution after 737 Max crashes

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has determined that Boeing violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft. It is now up to the Justice Department to weigh whether to file charges against the aircraft maker. Glenn Leon, the head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's criminal division, says Boeing failed to make changes to prevent it from violating federal anti-fraud laws -- a condition of the 2021 settlement. It is not clear whether the government will prosecute the manufacturing giant. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed.

CNX plans $1.5B hydrogen fuels plant at Pittsburgh airport, but wants federal tax credit to build it

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Natural gas producer CNX Resources says it plans to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh's airport to make hydrogen-based fuels. But, in its plan unveiled Wednesday, it says it will only build it if President Joe Biden's administration allows coal mine methane to qualify for hydrogen production tax credits. Biden's administration is deciding how to tailor billions in tax credits. CNX said the facility would remove coal mine methane from the atmosphere and blend it with natural gas to produce hydrogen-based airline fuel. Climate change activists say producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, instead of from carbon-free electricity, would undermine the purpose of the hydrogen program to displace fossil fuels.

Stock market today: Global markets follow Wall Street higher ahead of key inflation update

HONG KONG (AP) -- World stocks have advanced after a rally on Wall Street took the Nasdaq composite to a record high. U.S. futures were lower while oil prices gained. Markets in Hong Kong and Seoul were closed for holidays. Investors were reviewing a mixed report on inflation and awaiting an even more important update on consumer prices later Wednesday. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5% and was just shy of its own all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.8%. Treasury yields edged lower in the bond market following the mixed report on wholesale inflation.

Wholesale price increases accelerated in April as inflation remains sticky

WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. wholesale prices rose sharply last month, a sign that stubbornly high inflation may persist after three elevated readings in consumer prices to start the year. The Labor Department said Tuesday that its producer price index -- which tracks price changes before they reach consumers -- climbed 0.5% from March to April, after it dipped 0.1% the previous month. Measured year over year, producer prices rose by 2.2% in April, up from 1.8% in March and the biggest increase in a year.

Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again. Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year. Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.

As The Sofia Globe previously reported, Bulgaria had the largest drop in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU in the first quarter of 2023, again had the largest drop in the second quarter of 2023, and the second-largest drop in the third quarter of 2023, all on an annual basis.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022, Eurostat said.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23 per cent), Bulgaria (-17 per cent) and Finland (-9 per cent).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg).

Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions.

The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP, Eurostat said.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, EU economy greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 897 million tons of CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq), a 4.0 per cent decrease compared with the same quarter of 2022 (935 million tons of CO2-eq). The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2 per cent) and manufacturing (-3.1 per cent). Emissions by households remained almost stable, Eurostat said.

Imports are expected to rise to 23,692 megawatt hours (Mwh) on Wednesday, versus the previous high of 21,072 Mwh on Tuesday and 19,484 Mwh on Monday.

""Today, emergency electricity supplies from Poland, Romania and Slovakia have already been made at Ukraine's request. Emergency assistance is also expected to be provided during the day,"" the ministry said in a statement.

""In the evening, there may also be power shortages.""

The national power grid operator Ukrenergo said in a separate statement Ukraine would import electricity from Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.

The import volumes would be close to the maximum technically possible 1,700 megawatts hours which Ukraine is able to receive from the European Union states, it said.

Ukraine's biggest private power firm DTEK said on Tuesday the maximum volume of simultaneous imports could be increased to 2,200 Mwh.

Ukrenergo and the energy ministry have said negotiations on the increase are ongoing.

SAVING POWER

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, dealing significant damage and causing blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have caused more than $1 billion of damage to the sector, said Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko, and led to the loss of 8,000 Mwh of generating capacity from the energy system.

Ukraine consumes up to 19,000 Mwh at peak of consumption in winter.

Ukraine's DTEK said this week it lost about 90% of its power generation capacity due to Russian missile attacks in recent weeks.

The ministry asked residents and industries to reduce power consumption ""to reduce the load on the power system, as well as to use imports as much as possible to ensure that outages are avoided and the power system is more resilient.""

Ukrenergo imposed emergency power cuts this morning but then cancelled restrictions.

Strong today - Strong tomorrow.

Our BMW way into the future

Dear Shareholders!

A warm welcome from BMW Welt in Munich. A lot of people talk about the

transformation of mobility and the automotive industry - how one will

replace the other. At BMW, we do things a little differently. We call it:

continuous progress.

Becoming a little bit better every day - that is what we aspire to. And what

I, myself, am measured against. Never being satisfied with the status quo

brings us closer to our ambitious goals. Step by step. Or, more fittingly,

when talking about cars: mile by mile. That may sound very grounded and

methodical, but it certainly yields highly effective results.

We always look to the future. That is part of BMW's vast array of

experience. It gives us strength and empowers us, time and again, to take

bold action: We know what we are capable of! That is why BMW is still here

after 108 years.

- in a very literal sense. There are currently more than 150,000 of us

worldwide - representing nearly every nationality there is, united by the

BMW Spirit. In autumn of last year, we surveyed all our associates around

the world: 85 percent said they fully support the company's goals and

strategy. And even 93 percent are proud to work for the BMW Group.

What a boost for us!

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

We are mobilising them all for the next massive leap, because your

company is once again reinventing itself - at precisely the right time.

You, too, my dear shareholders, are part of our BMW team. Your support

for our direction gives us the momentum and latitude we need to make

decisions with a long-term perspective. This traces back to legendary

entrepreneur Herbert Quandt. What a legacy! The next generation is

carrying forward that legacy - much like we do at the company.

We always base our strategic decisions on facts and informed analysis.

This certainly requires experience and, sometimes, plain common sense, as

well. This makes your company robust and ensures that we remain

composed in a turbulent environment. All of this comes together in the

BMW way. This approach guarantees that the following always holds true

for your company:

""Strong today - strong tomorrow"".

For financial year 2023: Should you approve our proposed dividend, you

will receive a payout equivalent to 33.7 percent of our unappropriated

profit. During the financial year, we had revised our guidance upwards. At

year-end we met all our targets. We posted solid growth in sales, reaching

a new all-time high of more than 2.55 million vehicles. In fact, we are the

only German OEM to have regained our pre-pandemic level.

Our Group EBT margin of 11 percent came in higher than our strategic

target of 10 percent. We are consistently performing at a high level, as

confirmed by our EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment, which has been

within our defined target range of eight to ten percent for the past nine

quarters, including the first quarter of 2024.

This allows us to continue to make substantial investments.

Our capital expenditure, as well as our research and development

spending, will peak this year. We will once again be making major

investments - because our actions are always geared towards the future.

Individual mobility offers tremendous potential for profitable growth and

gaining market share.

Statement, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

Today, let's take a look at how we continue to forge our BMW way -

in four chapters.

Future to the max: Turning visions into reality.

Following our own convictions: Technology openness is effective.

Global success today means acting regionally.

The car as digital companion: We are making mobility more

human, more intelligent and more sustainable.

These focal points also shed light on the topics you requested through the

shareholder portal.

Turning visions into reality.

This is the first topic I would like to talk about today.

What you see right here is nothing less than the future: pure BMW - taken

to a whole new level. This is where all the big topics of future mobility come

together: Electric. Fully digitalised. Sustainable.

For now, they are still Vision Vehicles - but they will be on the roads in a

very similar form very soon. Last year, I promised you a new Vision Vehicle,

which we then unveiled at the IAA MOBILITY. The BMW Vision Neue

Klasse celebrated its premiere here in Munich. You'll see right away that it's

a sporty sedan.

No other car at the IAA received as much media coverage and positive

feedback - which is just one more reason to bring along another highlight

for you today: The BMW Vision Neue Klasse X - a car that very clearly

reimagines the BMW X philosophy in a totally new way.

Both vehicles will compete in high-volume segments - because we want

our innovations to have a broad impact, not just in niche segments. Both

vehicles underline that the NEUE KLASSE is consistent and broad at the

same time.

Consistent - in terms of design, technology and sustainability. Broad - with

respect to the other models that will follow.

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

These are the two bookends of the NEUE KLASSE - with lots of room inbetween that we intend to exploit. And we deliver on our promises:

Within 24 months of the start of production, there will be at least six

different models on the market.

Our industry has never seen speed quite like this before - but if anyone can

do it, then it's us at BMW. We are picking up the pace on a massive scale.

Our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, will lead the way, with the launch of

the first X model in late 2025. This will continue seamlessly in 2026 with

the Sedan at our main plant in Munich, as well as Plant Shenyang in China.

In 2027, the NEUE KLASSE will also ramp up in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

Our customers ask: How far can I drive on electric power? How quickly can I

charge my car?

We are able to tell them: at least 30 percent farther and 30 percent faster.

In practice, this means that: It only takes ten minutes to charge your car for

a 300-kilometre trip - hardly enough time to grab a coffee!

This is possible thanks to the new sixth-generation round cells. We are

using them for the first time in the NEUE KLASSE - which means you can

look forward to an even higher-level ""BMW driving experience"".

What might look like a Playstation is actually four super-brains, each

integrating several highly intelligent control units. This opens up new

possibilities - from powertrain and driving dynamics, to automated driving,

to how we interact with our cars.

The most important aspect for our customers is: What does the NEUE

KLASSE feel like on the road? The Board of Management already had the

chance to drive the pre-series - and, believe me, it gave us goosebumps.

The magnitude of the technological wave we are unleashing becomes even

clearer when you realise:

The innovations of the NEUE KLASSE will be incorporated into all BMW

models in the coming years, regardless of their drive technology. In simple

terms: Soon, all BMW technology will be NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE

KLASSE is set to become our innovation and technology booster for all

future areas of activity, including design.

We aren't just taking mobility to a new level; the BMW Group is also

becoming a NEW company. I believe this is entirely in your interest as our

shareholders.

My second topic for today reflects our belief in the effectiveness of

technology openness.

The heart of the NEUE KLASSE is electric - running on its own, new

architecture. If demand for electric vehicles continues to grow as forecast,

we will be able to leverage corresponding economies of scale.

But the world is a big place - which is why we continue to serve all markets

with premium products. With us, everyone can find the right drivetrain to

suit their needs. Anything else would be unwise from a business

perspective.

Using technology clusters and modules enables us to be highly flexible.

Think of it like this: We can roll out innovations and technological advances

across all architectures and segments, and scale them efficiently.

We don't distinguish between ""old"" and ""new"" vehicles - instead, we

deliver cutting-edge technology across all areas. And, moreover, we offer

the best overall package. This is what we aspire to - and it is perhaps the

underlying secret of your company's success.

Let me give you a current example: Following on from the new BMW 5

Series Sedan, the new BMW 5 Series Touring also comes in four drive

technologies. The BMW i5* is all-electric, with an impressive everyday

range of over 500 kilometres.

Plug-in hybrids also remain extremely popular. For the new BMW 5 Series,

the PHEV variant could account for about 20 percent of our sales in Europe.

This shows we are right on track with our ten attractive PHEV models. And

of course, the new 5 Series is also well received as a highly efficient

combustion engine.

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

Focused technology openness is not something that is achieved overnight.

You know my position: Building cars is a highly complex task. New market

players are realising this too.

It is a strength of your company - and I believe it is also a unique selling

point: The ability to master this complexity, seamlessly, and to effectively

orchestrate, scale and further develop technologies.

Our sales figures confirm this: BMW is maintaining its leading position in

the global premium segment. Our strongest growth last year came from the

upper premium and luxury class, as well as our all-electric models, or BEVs

for short. We delivered over 375,000 BEVs to customers in 2023 - an

increase of almost 75 percent over the previous year.

This dynamism is also reflected in our share of the global BEV market: At

4.1 percent, it is already significantly higher than our share of the total

global market, which remains stable at 3.3 percent.

Demand for BEVs will continue to climb - although not in a linear fashion; it

will be dynamic and market-specific. We reiterate this time and again - and

it holds true in multiple markets.

We see e-mobility as the fastest-growing drive technology - today and in

the future. By 2030, all-electric vehicles should account for about half of

our deliveries. We remain committed to this goal and are steering the rampup in line with demand. We will stay flexible - even well into the 2030s.

We are aligning our strategic planning accordingly - and enabling our

architectures. In this way, we can respond quickly at all times. More than

15 BEV models will be available this year across all BMW Group brands.

Here, you can see the MINI Aceman*.

In April, it celebrated its world premiere at AUTO CHINA. The Aceman is

offered exclusively as a all-electric vehicle.

It fills the gap between the Cooper* and the Countryman*, which has now

grown significantly in size. The new Cooper is already sold out - at least for

the next four months. The only thing missing is the new MINI Convertible,

which will be released in the second half of the year.

Together, these models form the NEW MINI Family, which is effectively the

counterpart to the NEUE KLASSE at BMW: MINI's leap into the future.

And: We produce the New MINI Family worldwide: at our Spotlight joint

venture in China; in Oxford, in the UK; and, for the first time, also in

Germany, at Plant Leipzig.

We talked about bookends earlier. Now, with our brands, let's jump from

MINI go-kart feeling to our luxury brand, Rolls-Royce. Spectre* certainly hit

the ground running. What a phenomenal start!

In the first quarter of this year, this model alone accounted for 38 percent of

Rolls-Royce deliveries. That is how we do e-mobility in the luxury class.

Spectre glides along effortlessly, like a flying carpet. Our luxury brand's

vehicles have never been as compelling and as differentiated as they are

today. And let's not forget that they also earn a significant contribution

margin for the company.

BMW Motorrad is also reporting profitable growth, having celebrated its

centenary in September. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz attended the

anniversary celebrations at Plant Berlin-Spandau.

We shared two major milestones with him:

First, the inauguration of the new ""BMW Motorrad Welt"". What BMW Welt

in Munich is to cars, we now also have in Berlin for our two-wheeled

vehicles. Second, the world premiere of the R 1300 GS. Many people -

myself included, as a motorcycle enthusiast - have been eagerly awaiting

the next-generation GS. The trade press was practically euphoric about it.

For those who prefer an electric ride in the city, BMW Motorrad's second

electric model, the CE 02, is perfect.

Our core BMW brand also has a slew of upcoming, exciting vehicles, with

14 launches and numerous model variants this year alone.

The BMW 1 Series will be released onto the market in the compact class.

And we will launch the new BMW X3 - one of our most popular models

overall. The new X3 will be available with a highly-efficient combustion

engine and as a plug-in hybrid variant.

We recently presented our new and future vehicles to our retailers,

including 1,500 retailers from all over Europe in Amsterdam. We did the

same in Las Vegas for over 1,000 dealers from the Americas region. I got

the sense at both events that our retailers are genuinely excited about what

is to come.

Especially for Europe, I have to stress: The retailers will remain by our side

in the new sales system - that won't change. We are already using direct

sales for MINI in China and reporting positive experiences in the first

European countries. We will be transitioning the BMW brand to the new

direct and fully digitalized sales model in Europe from 2026, as planned.

You, our shareholders, also wanted to know:

How are we progressing with hydrogen?

Our BMW iX5 Hydrogen* is currently on a world tour, undergoing real-life

testing. It is very well received, everywhere it goes. Our pilot fleet is raising

awareness of hydrogen's role in the energy transition - both for mobility

and across industries. You rightly expect us to meet the European Union's

CO2 requirements.

In 2023, the BMW Group significantly outperformed the CO2 fleet limit set

for us by the EU by more than 20 percent. This year, we expect to see

another slight reduction, with all brands and drivetrain variants

contributing.

Technology-centric, with a clear focus on e-mobility - we are always

consistent in our actions: This is how we are reshaping perception of your

company.

What the New York Times writes is precisely researched.

Statement, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG

104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024

In March, the New York Times praised our drivetrain strategy as far-sighted

and consistent. It described BMW as a ""winner in electric vehicles"" - and

Tesla's only serious competitor. We can certainly live with that. People

expect us to consider things carefully and come up with practical solutions

- because we consistently demonstrate our ability to do so.

In part three, I'll look at the reasons for our global success - which, now,

more than ever, requires us to act regionally. If you look closely, your

company stands out as one of the automotive industry's few ""truly"" global

manufacturers.

Something like this has to grow systematically - and we have been

expanding our footprint for this purpose over the decades.

Let me give you three examples:

China - our biggest single market; Europe - our most important sales

region; the US - our ""second home"":

First: China, where we employ about a fifth of our workforce. It is - after

Germany - our second-largest R&D location. BMW enjoys a high level of

trust there - and not just among our own customers. We are highly

regarded as a company, because we enter into serious, long-term

commitments.

This year, we are celebrating 30 years ""at home in China"" and more than

two decades of commitment in Shenyang.

In April, we signed a new investment agreement with Liaoning Province,

worth 20 billion renminbi or 2.5 billion euros. The Shenyang production site

of our BBA joint venture is transforming into a BMW iFACTORY.

Also in April, I was part of German Chancellor Scholz's economic delegation

to China. Shortly after that, I was in Beijing at AUTO CHINA, where Prime

Minister Li Qiang visited precisely one non-Chinese manufacturer - and

that was the BMW Group.

A phrase I hear a lot in China is ""China speed"". This is a dynamic country -

and we are picking up the pace to keep up: Just last week, our six-millionth

vehicle produced in Shenyang since 2003 rolled off the assembly line. We

only reached the five million mark about a year earlier. This means we

turned out one million vehicles in just 15 months - that is true ""China

speed"".

Second: Europe.

We sell nearly a third of all our vehicles in the European Union, where we

operate ten plants and maintain a broad supplier base. We all benefit from

a united Europe - every single day - and should channel all our collective

efforts into preserving it.

BMW maintains a global outlook. This is something the chair of the General

Works Council and I have reiterated. We urge our associates to pay close

attention whenever seemingly simple solutions are proposed for

complicated issues.

Enjoying democracy means living democracy - and that includes

participation, exercising your right to vote and raising your voice to stand

up for democracy. That is why we have asked everyone to vote on June 9.

What applies to Europe, applies even more to Germany: We need the best

minds - and the smartest minds think very carefully about where they want

to go. That is why we support the ""We stand for values"" initiative.

In Germany, we have many debates about emotionally charged trigger

points. There is broad consensus on meta-topics. This is how sociologist

Steffen Mau describes it. His latest study comes to the conclusion: We are

not a divided society.

As a result, we shouldn't speak ill of our country and Germany as a

location, but leverage our potential. I can only agree with that.

Third: the USA.

We refer to the US as our ""second home"". Next year will be our 50th year in

the United States.

In 2023, your company was once again one of the largest net exporters of

vehicles from the US by value. Germany is the only place where we have a

higher purchasing volume than the US, which currently totals 6.7 billion

euros annually.

For over 25 years, we have been a local partner - particularly in South

Carolina. Today, Spartanburg is our largest plant - and the whole of the

surrounding region has grown with us.

China, Europe and the US: Three examples of how our local presence

forges close ties with the regions and markets.

We are living proof that everyone benefits when people work together. That

is also one of the reasons why your company continued to grow in all major

regions of the world in 2023.

We do business around the globe - and benefit from an integrated global

economy.

Now, our global world order is evolving - from a ""unipolar world"" to a

""multi-polar world"", especially in the last 10-15 years. Authors like Carlo

Masala talk about the highly integrated and largely self-sufficient economic

areas now emerging. We remain committed to open markets and free

trade.

I also say this with a view to the European Union's current deliberations

over Chinese imports of electric cars. A 360-degree perspective would be

better: 20 percent of all BEVs sold in Europe last year came from China;

well over half were western brands, including BMW.

Protectionism triggers a spiral effect: Tariffs lead to new tariffs, with

protectionism rather than cooperation.

My over 30 years of experience at BMW suggest that solutions come about

when we reach out to one another - and when we are prepared to make

compromises ourselves.

That is how we build a consensus that makes us stronger as a society and

an economy and enables us to take action.

You are justified in asking how your company secures access to diversified,

fragmented markets.

The answer is: by continuing to invest at local level. Also, by finding local

solutions and partners for the upstream value chain.

""Local for local"" is our recipe for success - and we are now applying this

same principle to producing cells for the batteries needed for e-mobility.

Who has control over technological expertise and urgently needed raw

materials? That is what decides the competitiveness of companies and

economic areas. We locate production facilities for BMW high-voltage

batteries close to our vehicle plants - in Hungary, the US and China. Just a

few days ago, we laid the foundation stone for the high-voltage battery

assembly in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

The benefits for us are clear: Short transport distances and supply stability

in the event of unforeseen events around the globe.

And to get really local: Have you heard of Irlbach-Straßkirchen in Lower

Bavaria? It will supply Gen6 batteries for our plants in Bavaria from 2026

onwards. The process wasn't entirely straightforward. Residents wanted to

know: What are the benefits for our region? We engaged in in-depth

discussions with them to build trust. Ultimately, an overwhelming majority

voted in favour of the new BMW location.

As you can see: Global only works at local level - and this also applies to

our supply chains.

We have learned in recent years how vulnerable and susceptible to

disruption they can be. Take a guess: How many parts do you think our

plants worldwide need to be supplied with every day? The answer is:

36 million. The right quantities have to be in the right place, at the right

time, in the best quality.

Our digitalised ""i Supply Chain"" strategy ensures resilient supply chains.

Our ""RiskHub"" uses AI and data analytics to identify quality issues in the

supplier network early. We also adopt a proactive approach to avoid supply

bottlenecks.

You might already have heard of Catena-X. There's tremendous potential

here: Automotive manufacturers, suppliers and, soon, recyclers, are

creating a shared data ecosystem that makes sprawling supply chains

transparent and allows us to track the carbon footprint of individual

components. The type, quantity and source of the raw materials installed

can also be digitally documented, allowing us to ""trace"" them.

And we are about to embark on a pilot project: Plant Landshut produces

the kidney grille for the BMW iX* - one component made of many individual

components. We will be using data from Catena-X to measure the total

carbon footprint of production.

Wherever we collaborate with suppliers, we do so as partners, always

treating each other as equals. This is important to me.

Chapter four of my speech focuses on the car as a digital companion: We

are making mobility more human, more intelligent and more sustainable.

The world of bits and bytes is highly dynamic. Digitalisation, hand in hand

with artificial intelligence, is fundamentally changing how we experience

mobility. The questions you submitted through the shareholder portal

indicate that this interests you, too.

Intelligent, self-learning systems have long been part of our strategy for the

automotive production of the future. You know this as BMW iFACTORY.

Digital added value can be experienced directly in our vehicles, but our

approach here remains: Not everything that is possible also makes sense in

a car.

Our Head-Up Display is a classic. 20 years ago, we brought this technology

from the aeroplane into the car. Now, we are revolutionising this display

concept in the NEUE KLASSE.

Take a look for yourselves: Our ""BMW Panoramic Vision"" uses the full

width of the windscreen. Pure high-tech. But we also use digitalization to

increase security. In this case, we reduce distraction while driving.

we can update software in the vehicle at any time, without bringing it in to

the workshop. We chose this route early.

Today, your company has the world's largest fully upgrade-compatible

The BMW 5 Series sets the standard for automated driving. It is the first car

in Germany to be approved for partially automated driving at speeds up to

130 km/h on motorways.

This means you can take your hands off the steering wheel while driving.

Your car can also change lanes by itself, when you briefly glance in the side

mirror. Active Lane Change Assistant with eye confirmation - a somewhat

unwieldy name for a genuine world first.

Since March 2024, Highway Assist has also been available in the BMW 7

Series, X5, X6, X7, iX and XM*. That's level 2+.

The new BMW 7 Series does even more:

You can even temporarily turn your attention away from the road. It

fascinates me, every time the car regulates its own speed, distance and

tracking. That is Level 3 highly automated driving - available in the new

BMW 7 Series since March. A digital driving experience needs to ensure the

safety of all road users.

That is why your company only introduces mature technical solutions onto

the road- no beta versions. No experiments at the expense of our

customers. You can always rely on that.

Since summer 2023, we have been testing automated driving and parking

functions all the way up to Level 4 fully automated driving at our new

Revenue growth, sustainability and employee satisfaction - many people

consider these to be conflicting goals. We find a way to reconcile them.

Our markets are dynamic and the geopolitical environment uncertain. This

significantly higher percentage of all-electric vehicles.

The first fourth months of 2024 show that we are on track for all key

performance indicators.

As CEO of BMW, I travel the world a lot. Everywhere I go, I see not only how

valuable individual mobility is for many people, but how essential it is.

My experience is also that the BMW Group is appreciated and recognised in

all corners of the globe. All of this encourages us to continue forging our

own BMW way.

We are able to withstand the headwinds when we have confidence in our

direction - which we usually do.

Your company is part of the global community. We engage with it - and

evolve in and alongside it. That is extremely important.

The BMW way is also about our capacity for resonance - a term from

physics that is also used in sociology.

So, what do I mean by capacity for resonance?

The completion of the project, which comprises six solar parks, will enable Photon to advance the development of other renewable assets in the EBRD regions, the European lender said in a press release on Tuesday.

It sets out how the country plans to create opportunities post-coal. According to the strategy, gray hydrogen is initially expected to be used within industry in the current decade. This will then be replaced only gradually by electrolytic hydrogen. Solar-derived hydrogen is to be produced on sites of former opencast mines, with the first plant already in operation.

Fig. 2: The electrolyzer in the Bükkábrány energy park not only produces solar hydrogen but is also used for research

The ministry for innovation and technology which is responsible for Hungary's hydrogen strategy employs the terms ""carbon-free hydrogen"" and ""low-carbon hydrogen"" throughout its strategy paper. The expression ""green hydrogen,"" however, is absent. This is because the Paks nuclear power plant is due to play a major role in the country's hydrogen production. Unlike other nations, Hungary has openly underlined its desire to put nuclear power at the center of its hydrogen energy plans.

The small town of Paks, situated a good 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Budapest on the western side of the Danube, is currently home to four working nuclear reactors which together generate 2 gigawatts of power. In addition, the Russian enterprise Rosatom is building a further two reactors at this location which are scheduled for completion in 2032. Their generation capacity is expected to be 2.4 GW. The ministry foresees the power plants in Paks supplying large quantities of cheap, carbon-free electricity that will help build the hydrogen value chain.

The ammonia and refining industries have also established themselves in the Paks area. This points toward possible synergies between the power and mobility sectors within a hydrogen economy. Iron- and steelworks are located in Dunaújváros on the eastern bank of the Danube and cement factories are found in the Transdanubia region to the west of the river. This area likewise has the potential to decarbonize through the introduction of a hydrogen economy.

Another focus region for the hydrogen economy is expected to be the northwest of the country. Here, decarbonization efforts will center on the old Mátra coal-fired power plant. The mines and the brown coal generation facility will remain operational until 2025, after which time only companies involved in machinery construction, underground engineering and biomass production will continue their activities.

It is hoped that hydrogen will ensure an equitable transition for the Mátra power plant as it moves toward an emission-free future. The intention is to manage the social and economic changes caused by phasing out coal combustion, which will affect the lives of thousands of people, with utmost care and responsibility.

Beyond Transdanubia, initial pilot projects have demonstrated that green hydrogen made using solar power has a great deal of potential here. Photovoltaic plants are being installed on the sites of former opencast mines.

One such pilot project is the Bükkábrány energy park. The scheme is being supported by the University of Szeged and partially financed from EU innovation funds. In 2019, Bükkábrány was already producing solar power on a megawatt scale. By the end of 2023 (correct at the time of publication), generation is set to reach 100 MW of PV power. A further 40 MW is anticipated between 2024 and 2025. An electrolyzer with a 1-MW capacity produces high-purity hydrogen on the site.

Although the project represents the first instance of a commercial-scale electrolyzer plant, the operator is keen to emphasize the trial nature of the project. On the website it states that the electrolyzer will make use of the generation peaks of the neighboring 22-MW solar plant, which is located in an area that was once an opencast brown coal mine. It is understood that the University of Szeged developed the control technology for the plant and has indicated interest in purchasing some of the green hydrogen produced in Bükkábrány.

Xi landed in Paris on May 5 for his third state visit to France, and also his first trip to Europe in nearly five years.

This year celebrates the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties -- with France being the first major Western country to formalize relations with China in 1964.

In the 60 years since, bilateral relations have always stayed abreast of China's relations with Western countries, setting a prime example for countries with different social systems to coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation, Xi said in a written speech upon his arrival.

France is also the first among major Western countries to form a comprehensive strategic partnership with China, to strike a deal with China for air transportation and to cooperate with China on civil nuclear energy projects.

In recent years, the relationship between the two representatives of Eastern and Western civilizations has risen to new heights, and they keep making new progress in cooperation on aviation, aerospace, nuclear energy, agrifood and green development, Xi elaborated in his written speech.

Bilateral trade has surged dramatically, increasing 800-fold to reach $78.9 billion in 2023. China is now France's largest trading partner in Asia, while France ranks as China's third largest trading partner and third largest source of investment in real terms within the European Union (EU).

The two countries should stay committed to the spirit that guided the establishment of their diplomatic ties, namely, independence, mutual understanding, long-term vision and mutual benefit, and enrich it with new features of the new era, Xi said during talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on May 6.

As the world goes through transformation and turbulence not seen in a century, China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a ""new Cold War"" or bloc confrontation, Xi added.

China and France should uphold the international order and jointly advocate genuine multilateralism, Du Zhanyuan, President of China International Communications Group (CICG), said at the Second China-France Forum on Global Governance, cohosted by the Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies under CICG and the China-Europe-America Global Initiative, in Paris on May 2.

Du said the two countries should be pioneers in global development that provide new driving forces for world economic recovery; leaders in global governance and the joint endeavor to build a better world to live in; and practitioners of exchange and mutual learning. Together, they can help to build a harmonious world, he added.

Former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius said at the forum that as firm supporters of multilateralism, France and China must continue to be committed to the multilateralist framework. They share similar visions in global governance and look forward to finding solutions, maintaining international order and improving global governance through multilateral cooperation, according to him.

At the forum, Wu Hailong, President of the China Public Diplomacy Association, emphasized China's contribution to global governance and called on China and France to always uphold the spirit of unity and cooperation, actively eliminate the interference of geopolitics and ideology, jointly practice multilateralism, and give full play to the responsibility and influence of major countries in global governance.

Ironclad friendship

In Serbia, the 80-km Belgrade-Novi Sad section of the Belgrade-Budapest railway began operating on March 19, 2022, and has since facilitated the movement of people and even generated a new commuter lifestyle. So far, this railway section has served roughly 6.83 million passengers.

The two countries should make sure the entire Serbian section of the Belgrade-Budapest railway goes into operation as scheduled amid steadily advancing cooperation in traditional areas such as transportation and energy infrastructure, Xi said when meeting his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vučić in the Serbian capital on May 8. He also underlined the importance of jointly operating well major cooperation projects and creating more small and beautiful livelihood projects.

During the meeting, Xi said the two sides should deepen and expand high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, as well as the cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), by building a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, thereby advancing the modernization of their respective nations.

Vučić said China is Serbia's most sincere friend. Although Serbia is a small country, China always fully respects its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and provides valuable support for its economic and social development, he said.

After the talks, the two presidents signed the Joint Statement on Deepening and Elevating the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and Building a China-Serbia Community With a Shared Future in the New Era.

In October 2023, the two countries signed a free trade agreement (FTA), the first of its kind between China and the CEECs, set to take effect on July 1.

Serbian Ambassador to China Maja Stefanovic told People's Daily newspaper that the FTA will inject strong impetus into the further expansion of economic and trade cooperation between the two partners, and more high-quality products will have opportunities to expand their markets in each other's countries.

In the past, ""we have witnessed much cooperation in the fields of transportation and energy,"" Katarina Zakić, head of the Regional Center for Belt and Road at the Institute of International Politics and Economics, told Xinhua New Agency. Collaboration will be equally important in the fields of green energy and e-commerce in the future, she added.

Chinese companies and their Serbian counterparts are working on several green energy programs, such as the Saraorci Photovoltaic Project, the first ground-based photovoltaic project constructed by a Chinese company in Serbia, which, upon completion, will provide more than 16 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity every year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 16,000 tons.

A new model of interaction

Xi's visit to Hungary came amid the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties.

Hungary was one of the first countries to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1949, as well as the first European country to sign a Belt and Road cooperation agreement with China. The country has been a distribution center for China-Europe freight trains and a crucial link in the logistics and transport corridor between China and the European continent over the past decade.

""In recent years, our two sides have seen frequent high-level exchange, deepening mutual trust, fruitful outcomes in Belt and Road cooperation, vibrant people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and close coordination and collaboration in international and regional affairs,"" Xi said in a written speech upon his arrival.

In 2023, Hungary attracted 13 billion euros ($13.86 billion) in foreign direct investment, of which about 8 billion euros ($8.53 billion) came from Chinese investments, according to Hungarian Minister for National Economy Márton Nagy.

China's leading battery manufacturers Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) and EVE Energy, as well as electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD, have been working on production facility plans in Hungary.

The investment that came along with the rise of China's EV industry has been an opportunity, Nagy said, adding that by giving space to Chinese companies, Hungary has become a hub for electric car and battery manufacturing.

The China-Hungary relationship is now at its best in history, Xi said when meeting with Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok at the Sandor Palace in Budapest on May 9, adding that the traditional friendship has deeply taken root in the hearts of the people and cooperation in multiple fields has yielded fruitful outcomes.

Xi and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced the decision to elevate bilateral relations from their comprehensive strategic partnership established in 2017 to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era during their talks on May 9.

Elaborating on the decision during a joint press conference with Orbán, Xi said he and Orbán agreed that the two countries have always been good friends that trust and support each other as well as good partners that seek win-win cooperation over the years. It is natural for them to further upgrade relations and enrich bilateral cooperation, he added.

During their talks, Xi pointed out, with deepening political mutual trust and fruitful cooperation in various fields, China and Hungary have set a model for building a new type of international relations.

He said China will jointly forge greater synergy in development strategies with Hungary, as well as promote and expand bilateral cooperation in fields including infrastructure, green energy and artificial intelligence.

China's development is an opportunity rather than a risk for Europe, and Hungary is willing to strengthen multilateral communication and cooperation with China to jointly safeguard world peace and stability, Orbán said.

Healthy China-EU ties

During a trilateral meeting at the Elysée Palace in Paris on May 6 with Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Xi underscored the importance of bolstering cooperative ties between China and France as well as the EU, calling for dialogue and understanding amid escalating protectionism and raging conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

Former Deputy Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Yi Xiaozhun said at the May 2 forum that since China's accession to the WTO in 2001, China and the EU have always maintained close cooperation within the multilateral trading system and jointly led the multilateral negotiations in the WTO.

The two sides should continue to jointly send out a strong signal that China and the EU defend the multilateral trading system and oppose unilateralism or trade protectionism, he added.

All countries should abandon the zero-sum Cold War mentality, adhere to multilateralism, conform to the historical trend of openness and cooperation, and promote a global economic and trade governance system featuring joint governance, sharing and win-win results by strengthening multilateral cooperation, Yi concluded.",bjreview.com.cn,news,Beijing Review,,0.3019607843137255,453453231,26,https://www.bjreview.com/World/202405/W020240513428968433606.png,eng-9569691

This was reported by the press service of the ECU, noting that according to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Resolution No. 1127 of October 27, 2023, in the case of planned energy supply restrictions, such measures do not apply to enterprises that use imported electricity.

For this, the share of imported electricity in a specific hour of consumption should be at least 30% (in the period from October to April - at least 50%).

In connection with the shortage of electricity in the power system, EKU is currently negotiating with large industrial consumers regarding the conclusion of contracts for targeted imports.

In addition, EKU continues to increase the volume of electricity imports from EU countries to support the energy system. In May, the company started importing electricity from Poland, thus expanding the list of supplier countries to four, including Romania, Slovakia and Hungary.

According to NEC ""Ukrenergo"", the volume of electricity imports from Europe registered a record growth. Over the past two days, in particular on May 13, EKU imported the largest daily amount of electricity for the entire period of its activity.

However, due to a significant shortage of electricity, the system operator is forced to continue using capacity limitation schedules for industrial consumers. Today, May 14, the capacity limit schedules will be in effect from 4:00 PM to 7:00 AM on May 15.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) forecasts growth across its region of operations, comprising Emerging Europe, Central Asia and the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (SEMED), at 3.0% in 2024, up from 2.5% in 2023, as outlined in its latest Regional Economic Prospects report released on May 15.

The growth forecast, however, falls slightly below last September's projections, with a downward revision of 0.2 percentage points (pp). This revision is partly attributed to the weak performance in early 2024, particularly evident in Central Europe and the Baltic states, reflecting Germany's economic stagnation, the development bank said.

""Last year was very difficult for some Central European and Baltic countries. This year is going to be better, but some of the figures in Q1 were less strong than we expected, hence the downgrade,"" commented EBRD chief economist Beata Javorcik in an interview with bne IntelliNews in Yerevan.

""In the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean we have spillovers from the war in Gaza and slower-than-expected progress in Egypt on some of the big government investment projects,"" Javorcik added.

Meanwhile, Central Asia's growth stemming from intermediated trade is expected to taper off, resulting in more modest growth prospects.

Inflation declines

Despite facing headwinds from global geopolitical tensions, including trade restrictions, the EBRD remains optimistic about the economic trajectory of its regions, projecting a further uptick in growth to 3.6% in 2025.

Titled ""Taming Inflation"", the report points to a moderation in inflationary pressures compared to last year, when the region as a whole experienced an economic slowdown attributed to high energy prices stemming from the conflict in Ukraine and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, Javorcik pointed out that despite the disinflation, in some countries in the region inflation remains high.

Regional differences

Despite the slow start to 2024, in Central Europe and the Baltic states, growth is anticipated to gradually improve, with projections for 2024 at 2.2% and an expected acceleration to 3.1% in 2025.

Growth is set to reach as high as 3.5% in Estonia, Hungary and Poland, despite downgrades for several countries compared to the September 2023 forecast. The steepest downgrades across the EBRD's region of operations are for Estonia (down by 1.7 pp), followed by Czechia (-1.6pp).

In the Southeast European EU member countries -- Bulgaria, Greece and Romania -- GDP growth is projected to increase from 2.0% in 2023 to 2.8% in 2024, supported by accommodative fiscal policies and robust real wage growth.

Growth in the Western Balkans is expected to rise to 3.3% in 2024 from 2.5% last year, with Kosovo set to be the fastest growing economy in the Western Balkans region in both 2024 and 2025. Its forecast for 4.0% growth remains unchanged.

Across the wider region, Central Asia will achieve the strongest growth, although it is anticipated to dip slightly from 5.7% in 2023 to 5.4% in 2024, with a rebound expected in 2025 to 5.9%.

The Caucasus will see more moderate growth of 4.1% in 2024, settling closer to 3.5% in 2025. Armenia stands out with 6.2% growth expected this year, an upward revision of 1.7pp compared to September 2023.

This is linked partly to the influx of Russians since the invasion of Ukraine, which had a particularly large impact on Armenia.

""When the Ukraine war started, the Caucasus countries and Central Asia saw an influx of Russian capital, companies and Russians. The influx to Armenia was equivalent to 2.5% of the population. This is paying dividends,"" said Javorcik.

Armenia's population was further boosted by the arrival of around 100,000 ethnic Armenians from Nagorno Karabakh after the war with Azerbaijan.

Ukraine's output expansion is likely to be constrained in 2024 due to significant damage to electricity infrastructure. Growth is expected at 3.0% in 2024, rising to an expected 6.0% next year. Javorcik noted that under current circumstances it is ""incredibly hard"" to make predictions for Ukraine.

""The good news is the passing of the funding bill for Ukraine by the US Congress, and the Black Sea shipping route is now open. The negative is the heavy bombings in March and April that destroyed about 60% of Ukraine's electricity generation capacity,"" she said.

Turkey's economy is projected to decelerate from 4.5% growth in 2023 to 2.7% in 2024, with a slight uptick to 3.0% in 2025, reflecting expectations of stricter monetary and fiscal policies.

Revised growth forecasts for the SEMED region anticipate an acceleration from 2.6% in 2023 to 3.4% in 2024, albeit with some downward revisions due to delays in public investment projects and ongoing conflicts.

Changing trade patterns

The report also highlights how geopolitical tensions are reshaping trade patterns, with rapid fragmentation observed in trade.

So-called ""connector economies"" -- a term coined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for countries that serve as bridges between the eastern and western blocs - have emerged as significant recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI), positioning themselves to reap benefits from this increasing fragmentation.

""There are multiple things happening. On the one hand, we see firms reorganising global supply chains to increase their resilience,"" said Javorcik.

""Then with the sanctions and rise of intermediated trade and trade diversions around Russia, there has been a dramatic drop in Western exports [to Russia], and an increase of exports from Turkey, China, and intermediated trade coming via Central Asia. Yet another aspect is geopolitics driving FDI flows.""

In 2023, there was a marked surge in inward FDI from China into the EBRD regions. At the same time, investments from Russia into Central Asia have been on the rise, particularly in logistics services.

Another trend is the increase in defence spending.Since February 2022, there has been an uptick in the arms trade relative to the imports and exports of EU economies within the EBRD regions, with the share increasing from 0.1% pre-Ukraine war to 0.3-0.5%.",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,0.1450980392156862,453447840,4,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/Screenshot_2024-05-15_at_09.12.07.png,eng-9564011

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) expects output in its regions to grow by three per cent in 2024, up from 2.5 per cent in 2023, despite challenges stemming from global geopolitical tensions, including growing limitations on trade, according to its latest Regional Economic Prospects report published this week.

Growth in the Bank's regions is projected to pick up further in 2025, to 3.6 per cent.

The new report, Taming Inflation, showcases an easing of inflationary pressures relative to last year, which was marked by economic slowdown due to high energy prices resulting from the war on Ukraine and post-Covid recovery.

While growth is expected to accelerate, the forecast is slightly below last September's projections, with a downward revision of 0.2 percentage points. This is partly due to slower-than-expected growth in early 2024 across central Europe and the Baltic states, echoing Germany's sluggish economic performance.

Southern and eastern Mediterranean economies face weak growth as a result of the spillovers from the war in Gaza and reduced fiscal stimulus in Egypt, while Central Asia's growth contributions from intermediated trade are levelling off, and are expected to be more modest in the future. A booming ICT sector, however, is seeing unprecedented levels of high growth.

As energy and food prices moderated since 2022, inflation in the EBRD regions fell to an average of 6.3 per cent in March 2024 from a peak of 17.5 per cent in October 2022. While this drop was quicker than expected a year ago, inflation remains two percentage points above pre-pandemic levels. This pattern mirrors trends in advanced economies, where inflation has declined but remains above central banks' targets.

The forecast notes slower disinflation in EBRD countries with larger budget deficits and weaker macroeconomic frameworks.

""While disinflation has been faster than expected, inflation in some of our countries remains high,"" says Beata Javorcik, the EBRD's Chief Economist.

""The outlook is subject to significant risks, particularly from the escalation of geopolitical tensions and its unwanted economic effects. While the current shifts in trade and investment relationships may benefit some individual economies, let's not forget that globally, geopolitical fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and higher volatility.""

The report describes how geopolitical tensions are impacting the Bank's economies, leading to rapid fragmentation in trade and increased defence spending, while eroding the peace dividend -- the economic benefit resulting from a reduction in defence expenditure and a subsequent reinvestment of funds in the civilian economy.

Since February 2022, arms trade as a share of imports and exports of the European Union economies in the EBRD regions increased from 0.1 per cent to 0.3-0.5 per cent. Countries are increasingly trading certain goods only with certain partners. ""Bridging"" economies which trade with both eastern and western blocs have been large recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) and stand to benefit from fragmentation.

Inward FDI from China to the EBRD regions picked up sharply in 2023. Similarly, investment from Russia to Central Asia has been rising, particularly in logistics services.

Geopolitical pressures are also reflected in the elevated borrowing costs observed in the EBRD countries in the EU. The median yield on five-year government bonds increased by three percentage points from early 2022 to April 2024 across the Bank's regions.

May 2024 marks the 20th anniversary of the EU accession of eight economies where the EBRD invests: Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.

Over the past two decades, these countries have experienced significant growth in their per capita incomes, transitioning from being only about a quarter as affluent as Germany in 2003 to achieving half its GDP per capita by 2023.

This was faster than the speed with which other emerging markets at similar levels of development were converging with advanced economies. The swift convergence can be largely attributed to the ""EU accession bonus"", which was facilitated by rapid growth of exports relative to GDP as these economies integrated more deeply with the European and global supply chains.

The growth outlook in Central Europe and the Baltic states is expected to gradually improve, with 2024 projections being at 2.2 per cent and accelerating further to 3.1 per cent in 2025. Yet, growth forecasts in several economies have been revised down since September 2023 due to weak economic activity in recent months.

In the EBRD countries in the south-eastern EU, GDP growth is projected to pick up from two per cent in 2023 to 2.8 per cent in 2024, supported by accommodative fiscal stances and robust real wage growth.

Similarly, the Western Balkans region expects growth to increase to 3.3 per cent in 2024 from 2.5 per cent last year.

Central Asia is expected to face a slight decline in growth from 5.7 per cent in 2023 to 5.4 per cent in 2024, as intermediated trade with Russia appears to have reached a plateau, while spring floods weigh on Kazakhstan's growth prospects. However, a rebound is expected in 2025, to 5.9 per cent.

Growth in the Caucasus is forecast to be moderate at 4.1 per cent in 2024 before settling closer to 3.5 per cent in 2025, a level in line with estimates of medium-term potential growth.

Ukraine's output expansion meanwhile is expected to be held back in 2024 due to significant recent damage to electricity infrastructure. Limited domestic demand, labour shortages and insufficient investments will also likely constrain growth prospects, the report says.

However, a recovery of exports and the expansion of domestic military production will likely generate economic growth of three per cent in 2024 accelerating to six per cent in 2025.

The EBRD's report notes that the Caucasus and Central Asia have seen an uptick in ICT, in large part a result of highly skilled Russian professionals choosing to relocate to the Caucasus and Central Asia, taking advantage of linguistic and cultural proximity and the relative ease of gaining residence and opening bank accounts.

Russian relocanty include large numbers of entrepreneurs, as well as experienced IT and creative industry personnel. For instance, Georgia is estimated to have received more than 20,000 Russian tech professionals and more than 21,000 legal entities (firms) were established by Russian entrepreneurs between March 2022 and July 2023.

Kazakhstan has seen a doubling in the number of entities with Russian participation (19,000 firms as of October 2023 compared with around 8,000 in 2021), driven by a fivefold increase in ICT businesses. Armenia has seen a doubling in the number of ICT sector employees in 2022, with some multinational corporations, such as Nvidia, moving whole teams from Russia and opening research and development centres in Yerevan.

Caucasus and Central Asian economies introduced comprehensive ""absorption"" packages targeted at these professionals, including generous tax benefits, streamlined work permitting procedures and relocation support for companies and individuals registered with specially designated economic zones, such as the Astana Hub in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan's IT Park and Kyrgyzstan's High Technology Park.

As a result, the ICT sectors have been developing rapidly. For instance, Kyrgyzstan's High Technology Park's revenues increased by 70 per cent between 2022 and 2023 (95 per cent of its revenue come from ICT exports). The number of (local and foreign) companies registered with the park increased from 228 in 2022 to 383 in 2023.

IT exports by Uzbekistan's IT Park increased 2.4-fold relative to 2022, while Astana Hub's IT exports increased by 84 per cent year on year in 2023. With significant real estate at its disposal, Uzbekistan's IT Park introduced a new ""Zero Risk"" programme granting participating companies free office space for one year, assistance with office equipment, and partial reimbursement of local personnel salary and training costs (effectively amounting to a negative income tax).

Daniel Shugar

Thank you, Mary. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Fiscal year 2024 was a fantastic year for Nextracker in the solar industry. As I reflect on the past year and what's before us, it's increasingly clear that solar will continue to be the leading choice for new power generation and Nextracker will continue leading solar trackers and system solutions. Our accomplishments last year significantly advanced our mission to be the most trusted and valued renewable energy company by delivering intelligent, reliable and productive solar power.

Nextracker's DNA is about meeting or exceeding expectations with our customers and all stakeholders including investors. Our results for the last fiscal year reflect that and Q4 is our fourth consecutive quarter of beating our revenue and profit targets. In Q4, strong execution by Team Nextracker enabled us to achieve record revenue, profits and backlog. Revenue grew 40% year-on-year to $737 million. We also doubled our adjusted EBITDA year-over-year to $160 million and this excludes significant IRA 45X tax credit benefits.

In the quarter, both US and international deliveries beat expectations. We reached record international revenue in Q4 of $242 million nearly a 90% increase year-over-year, and we reported our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit revenue growth.

Looking at our fiscal year, Nextracker achieved strong execution and significant growth with accelerated revenue profits and cash flow to record levels. Equally important, we increased our pace of innovation and products, expanded our global supply chain and our talented global team. We exited the year with $2.5 billion in revenue, an increase of over 30% from prior year and more than doubled adjusted EBITDA to $521 million. Our growth was enabled by relentless focus on exceeding customer expectations through innovation, execution and customer service.

Moving to our new contracted bookings. Strong sales momentum globally resulted in a new record backlog of over $4 billion. Backlog increased more than 50% from last year's $2.6 billion and tripled over the last two years. As always our backlog is defined to a strict standard of executed contracts or purchase orders with deposits, bills of material and ship dates for specific projects.

With robust backlog exiting fiscal 2024, we're introducing annual guidance for next year. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $600 million to $650 million, approximately 20% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Dave will share more on guidance.

We're thrilled to announce, we have reached a new company milestone of 100 gigawatts shipped since inception. 100 Gigawatts of power is twice the peak load of the state of California, the world's sixth largest economy. While we are the first US solar company to achieve the milestone of 100 gigawatts shipped, we view this accomplishment as a win for the entire clean power industry, as well as Nextracker. We're also pleased to announce that we have successfully expanded our global supply chain to over 50 gigawatts annually, with US capacity at over 30 gigawatts annually.

Expanding our global supply chain footprint has been instrumental to scaling the business. We now have over 80 major suppliers strategically located across five continents to support our growth. In the US, we played a key role in revitalizing domestic manufacturing by enabling domestic production in 20 new or expanded partner facilities since 2021. About two years ago for example, we inaugurated a new facility in Pittsburgh with JM Steel. Just last month, we celebrated the expansion of the same facility with JM Steel and tripling annual capacity.

Today, we are in an excellent strategic position globally with manufacturing partners operating more than 80 facilities with bespoke Nextracker dedicated production equipment in many of them. We're raising the bar even higher. Just a few weeks ago, we launched the industry's first low-carbon tracker solution with up to 35% lower carbon footprint and announced sales orders from leading customers.

Initially offered in the United States, the low carbon tracker solution includes, life cycle assessment documentation using third-party verified analysis of environmental benefits. Nextracker also achieved a carbon footprint label certification issued by the Carbon Trust for our NX Horizon low carbon tracker. And we've doubled down on innovation. Over the last two years, we've doubled our R&D investments to drive product development and allow for global expansion. Fiscal '24 was a key investment year, as we built out product groups, program management teams, sales and engineering teams.

We also began a third global R&D center for solar excellence in India, complementing our existing R&D facilities in Brazil and headquarters in Silicon Valley. These centers all have dedicated labs and teams co-located with field testing and piloting of products and solutions. And finally, we've trained over 1,000 solar workers in five of our PowerworX training academies around the world. Our training programs include tracker installation, commissioning and operations and maintenance. This is a value-added service for our EPCs owners and developers and we're helping elevate the solar sector with skilled workers.

We believe our technologies, protected by over 500 issued and pending patents enable our customers to achieve the best financial returns, because they operate at the lowest levelized cost of energy. We further believe this is achieved because our systems generate more energy and our lower cost to operate and lower risk across a wide range of extreme weather including wind, hail and flooding.

We also recognize that our activities can have an impact on the environment. In our recently published environmental policy, we outlined our commitment to managing operations in an environmentally responsible manner. Providing a safe workplace for our people and our partners is one of our core values, which is why I'm pleased that we earned the ISO 45001 certification for our safety management system during the fiscal year, achieving the latest global occupational health and safety accreditation.

We'll now provide a market update. Solar deployments continue to accelerate in most of the world because solar is the lowest cost option for new power. As covered on our last call, the US Energy Information Administration is forecasting Solar to be the fastest-growing energy technology with a 26% compound annual growth over the next five years and becoming the number one energy source within a decade.

Nextracker's history of 30% CAGR over the last five years reflects favorably on the EIA forecast as does our strong backlog. On prior earnings calls, we've had questions regarding sector headwinds and interconnection permitting in other areas. We noted that these headwinds can be real for any given project or customer, but that the total universe of projects and customers has grown such that in totality the market continues strong growth. We thought it would be helpful to put some numbers to that using our largest market which is the US.

In our slides you will find analysis from the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley labs that pull source data from US independent system operators related to the US pipeline. The result is that solar totally dominates plant power with 60% of the current Q positions. Nearly 7,000 solar projects have Q positions in the US with solar and solar plus storage comprising about 1,500 gigawatts of new capacity.

For context, the new solar and solar plus storage projects have more total capacity than the entire existing US power generation sector. This Q position analysis by DOE provides graphic proof that solar and storage are leading the US energy transition. Solar dwarfs Q positions for natural gas by an astounding factor of 25 times.

And there are zero new nuclear or coal plants in the Q. This trend is not a strictly US phenomenon, rather a trend of multiple regions globally. Solar is leading global energy capacity additions and solar economics have never been more favorable. As the world transitions to renewable energy, Nextracker is increasingly well positioned in the solar power ecosystem to drive growth.

Now I'll turn the call over to Howard Wenger, our President to expand on our commercial progress and products.

Howard Wenger

Thank you, Dan. We indeed had an outstanding Q4 and full fiscal year, setting revenue records for both US and international segments. We continue to see solid demand globally with significant orders where we have tracker fleets operating in nearly 40 countries. Our backlog at the end of Q4 reached a new record of over $4 billion. Backlog has increased every quarter since our IPO in February 2023. In fact, we have more than tripled our backlog in just two years. Our robust backlog is supportive of our fiscal year 2025 guidance as backlog is defined to a strict standard of executed contracts or purchase orders with deposits, bill of materials and project-specific ship dates.

Q4 bookings remain strong globally. In the US, we achieved record bookings for fiscal 2024 by focusing on EPC partners and booking individual projects, as well as continued strategic alignment with developers and owners. Moreover, our accelerated US supply chain expansion equipped us with domestic content capabilities that tailored well to what our customers need, and now we have even more local supply capacity to pave the way for future growth.

We are pleased to announce that we achieved record bookings internationally for the year as well, including sizable customer contracts in India, Australia, Europe and Brazil. A few international milestones are noteworthy for the year. We booked our largest European project ever, a 550-megawatt power system in Greece, and we booked our largest ever Horizon XTR project at over 1 gigawatt in KSA, or Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And we have bookings in six new countries, South Africa, Colombia, Hungary, New Zealand, Romania and Sweden.

Now let me address the price environment. As I said on the last call, I can't stress enough that trackers are highly engineered products that factor in conditions such as soil and foundation requirements, current and future land use, topography, wind speeds, panel type, extreme weather and local permit needs codes and standards. Trackers are the backbone of any solar power system that needs to deliver energy for 30 years or more, withstanding the elements throughout.

We believe there has been a continued flight to quality even as pricing continues to be competitive. We strongly believe that Nextracker offers the highest quality and most reliable product on the market with the lowest install cost, lowest operating cost, highest production and best technology and engineering. We further believe this results in Nextracker delivering the lowest LCOE and highest financial returns for plant owners with unsurpassed quality and durability that discerning buyers appreciate.

Finally, we believe that reductions in solar power system costs and pricing, is a healthy dynamic. As the solar industry continues scaling, costs along the entire value chain have dramatically decreased, resulting in solar being among the most competitive generation technologies. Lower solar energy pricing has driven a rapidly increasing TAM.

And as Dan noted, solar is now the most installed form of new power generation. This is a very exciting dynamic and growth opportunity considering that solar is less than 5% of all global electricity generation. Nextracker's innovation and cost reduction programs have enabled us to be increasingly competitive while our volumes expand as the global power sector transitions to renewable energy.

In summary, we had a very successful year in strengthening customer partnerships, capturing new business and delivering a record year of bookings, backlog and revenue. We finished fiscal 2024 with 68% of total revenue from the US and 32% Rest of World. And we had double-digit year-over-year growth in most regions, demonstrating, again, our global scale and expansion where we had over 300 active projects around the world.

Let me now transition to products and solutions and our innovation progress. First, let's discuss our intelligent energy yield maximization software, TrueCapture. I'm pleased to report, we saw continued increases in customer adoption in fiscal 2024 with record TrueCapture bookings and backlog.

Since TrueCapture was created, we have led the industry with over 300 projects and reaching over 50 gigawatts deployed or under fulfillment. TrueCapture has been extensively validated by third party engineers and is generally a meaningful driver of improved energy yield and LCOE for power plant owners.

And TrueCapture is the gift that keeps on giving to our customers as we provide over-the-air updates to automatically upgrade existing TrueCapture projects with subsequent enhancements. In parallel, we continue to invest in desktop, cloud and mobile software that helps improve commissioning times, enables robust control and measurement of our trackers, and generally enhances our customers' experience.

Now, shifting to Horizon XTR, the industry's most deployed and proven all-terrain solar tracker, first delivered in calendar year 2019 and with more than 90 utility scale projects operating or in fulfillment. We've had an excellent response from our customers reaching a cumulative 15 gigawatts deployed or under fulfillment in Q4. And we booked the largest XTR project in fiscal 2024, a world record first for the industry of a 1-gigawatt project for a terrain following tracker.

Horizon XTR was developed to drastically reduce time consuming and costly projects site grading, and our XTR tracker can also allow for soil settlement and subsidence. This past fiscal year, we doubled the insulation capability of Horizon XTR to conform to even more sloping terrain opening up even more solar siting possibilities.

Unknown soil conditions and uneven terrain present unique risk for developers and owners. XTR can derisk projects by moving less earth and deploying shorter piles, which can reduce costs and mitigate soil erosion, leaving valuable top soil intact for future farming use.

Let's now address severe weather. There has been an increased prevalence of extreme weather around the world. We believe we have the industry's most capable and responsive tracker for severe weather, equipping owners with operational tools for mitigating risk.

For example, a number of utility-scale solar systems have experienced hail damage. Hail damage depends on many factors including hail size, wind speed and direction, panel glass thickness and construction, tracker tilt angle and operator actions. In response, Nextracker collaborated with customers to develop an industry-first hail stow technology that has helped mitigate risk with initial deployments three years ago.

This year alone, Nextracker already has documented hundreds of successful hail stows in Texas through the use of our software. So far in calendar year 2024, of the 27 Texas projects that were subjected to hailstorms and had our NX Navigator and hail stow installed none of them reported hail damage.

To address the most extreme hail Nextracker developed a next-generation fully automated hail stow technology which we announced in September 2023 called Hail Pro with up to a 75-degree rotation angle. Our Hail stow functionality at a high 75-degree angle can mitigate risk by dramatically reducing the probability of panel breakage. We plan to have our initial deployments later this year.

With respect to flooding our NX Horizon tracker is designed above the flood plane with self-powered architecture in which sealed gears controllers and motors are all mounted to the steel torque tube itself. This elevated design configuration typically provides a minimum flood clearance of three feet.

Our NX Navigator control system has flood stow functionality that can stow to a safe position with a single press of a button by plant operators or can automatically stow when equipped with flood sensors.

Now moving to wind engineering which is vital to trackers. We recognized early on that applying minimum static pressure wind design code standards to solar trackers is inadequate. We pioneered characterization of dynamic wind forces and Solar rays including phenomenon such as Torsional Galloping over the last decade publishing white papers and webinar since 2019.

This fundamental research combined with full-scale outdoor field testing at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado was integrated into our products. As a result, Nextracker NX Horizon systems have had no substantial wind failures over the last seven years.

On multiple sites and occasions around the world Nextracker Systems have endured extreme wind events reliably while adjacent competitive tracker system suffered extensive and widespread damage. Customers understand that engineering and technology really matter.

We believe we are driving the gold standard for solar trackers and this is being rewarded with repeat customer orders. Our unrivaled inventions and technologies in mechanics, electronics and software help customers derisk projects and improve project economics while expanding geographic areas where solar is cost-effective.

Our catalog of positive attributes earned and proven over many years translates into what we believe is the most bankable product with the lowest levelized cost of energy. In summary, we are immensely proud of our team's execution and milestones achieved this past year and we are ready to take on and deliver a strong fiscal 2025.

Now I turn the call over to Dave Bennett, our Chief Financial Officer to review financials. Dave?

David Bennett

Thank you, Howard. Before I start I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics except for revenue are non-GAAP adjusted and all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise stated.

As a reminder, our Q4 non-GAAP results exclude the IRA 45x benefits recognized in the current quarter for GAAP purposes. The results for Q4 and fiscal year 2024 both set new records delivering double-digit growth for the top-line and triple-digit growth for profits.

Starting with our quarterly results Q4 was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth since the IPO. Revenue closed at $737 million up 42% driven by 27% growth in the US market and 89% growth in the rest of the world. Q4's revenue mix was 67% US and 33% Rest of World.

There was strong execution by our teams and progressing projects to plan this quarter and we did not encounter weather delays that often impact deliveries in the last two weeks of the quarter. Gross margins for the quarter expanded by just over 10 percentage points from the prior year to 30% as a result of strong execution on our contracts, continued efforts optimizing our supply chain and exercising consistent pricing discipline.

Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $160 million, an increase of $87 million or 120% growth. Our Q4 EBITDA margin of 22% was up nearly 800 basis points for the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.96 in the quarter.

Turning to full year results. Fiscal year 2024 was our third consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue was $2.5 billion, up 31%, with the US representing 68% of the mix and the rest of the world at 32%. Despite some quarterly variations in mix throughout the year, overall very balanced 30%-plus growth across both markets. Full year gross margins expanded to 28% as a result of our strong execution as well as our success in achieving structural enhancements to our business throughout the year, which included optimizing our global supply chain and increasing our localized content offering, resulting in lower material and logistics costs on top of faster lead times. Gross margins also benefited from a larger US mix, which on average carries a higher pricing range and margin profile compared to the rest of the world.

Turning to operating expenses, which includes R&D expense. We have strategically increased these costs by $83 million or 86%, as we continue to invest in our growth innovation and standalone public company infrastructure post-spin from Flex. Going forward, we expect to maintain our investment in operating expenses at between 7% and 8% of revenue.

Full year adjusted EBITDA was $521 million, an increase of $312 million or 150% growth, establishing a new annual record for the company. We have more than doubled our EBITDA dollars in the last year. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 21% was up nearly 10 percentage points from the prior year.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.06 for the year. As previously stated, the separation from Flex increased our public float by approximately 74 million shares but did not impact our diluted EPS. Adjusted free cash flow was $113 million for the quarter and $427 million for the year, driven by strong net working capital management, customer deposits and higher EBITDA. Net working capital at the end of Q4 was approximately 16% of trailing 12 months revenue, which was slightly above our expected 10% to 15% levels, primarily due to the recognition of $126 million of vendor rebate receivables recorded in conjunction with the IRA, 45X incentive that I will cover shortly.

Our high-quality balance sheet, cash flow generation and ample liquidity remain competitive advantages. We closed the quarter with $474 million in total cash, which is greater than three times our total debt of $150 million. Total liquidity at the end of Q4 was over $800 million. We continue to operate with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than one with no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2028.

Our financial strength supports our capital allocation strategy with the following key highlights. Our capital deployment is focused on enabling growth. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be greater than 70% excluding M&A. We are in a net cash position and our current debt-to-EBITDA ratio is less than one as we are committed to maintaining a differentiated capital structure.

Under the current framework, we will evaluate future M&A with discipline and would expect investments to be funded through our operating cash flows and incremental debt capacity if required. In the short-term, given our projected growth and limitations with our previous Flex spin-out structure, we are currently not planning to execute on a dividend or a share buyback program.

Let me now transition to the IRA 45X benefit considerations for Nextracker. We have developed valuable relationships with our critical vendors and have successfully executed multiple supply agreements, many exclusive to Nextracker. As previously stated, the IRA 45X incentives currently earned are in the form of a rebate from our vendors. The key objective is to reduce cost of materials to enable domestically made products to be more cost competitive with imports. So far, we have achieved our objective of reducing the cost of materials.

Let me provide some details. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded a cumulative adjustment to recognize 45X vendor rebates on production of eligible components shipped to projects after January 1, 2023. As of the end of Q4, we recognized $126 million in other current assets related to the rebate receivable from our vendors of which, $121 million was recognized as a reduction in GAAP cost of sales. The remaining $5 million was deferred, as of year-end to be recognized as a reduction to cost of sales in fiscal 2025.

The $121 million GAAP cost of sales reduction, exceeded our previously anticipated range of $50 million to $80 million in Q4, mainly due to increased volume and final assessment of the contractual terms, impacting the timing of realization.

Our fiscal 2025 guidance that I will share next includes, the estimated IRA 45X benefits. As we previously communicated, we are operationalizing the IRA 45X incentive, into our procurement process and financial reporting systems. Therefore, we believe the 45X benefits should be reported, with our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2025 and moving forward.

Our structural margin has increased from the mid-20s to the high 20s for fiscal 2025. This expected increase factors and 45X benefits, variations in regional and customer mix and expected pricing pressure that may lower ASPs. The 45X benefit is one element, that lowers the cost of our trackers and is used in combination with other elements including cost downs, lower logistics costs and maximizing local content, all of which come together in the form of lower LCOE that along with pricing discipline, supports our confidence in our structural margin profile.

As always, we encourage you to evaluate Nextracker on an annual basis to reflect the nature of our large-scale projects. Therefore, we will not provide quarterly guidance, but we will provide top line comments as guideposts.

Based on the current timing of projects, Q1 fiscal 2025, year-over-year revenue growth is expected in the range of 25% to 30%. Our fiscal 2025 guidance is as follows: We expect revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. At the midpoint, we are expecting approximately 14% growth year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $600 million to $650 million. At the midpoint, we are expecting approximately 20% growth year-over-year and an implied EBITDA margin of approximately 22%.

GAAP EPS is expected to be between $2.41 to $2.61 per share, and includes approximately $0.48 related to stock-based compensation and intangible amortization. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $2.89 to $3.09 per share based on 153 million weighted average shares outstanding. Net interest and other expense is expected to be between $15 million to $20 million. We expect the fiscal year adjusted income tax rate to range between 20% to 25%.

I will now turn the call back to Dan for concluding remarks. Dan?

Daniel Shugar

Thank you, Dave. I'm so proud of our team and what we've accomplished last year. We're excited that this New Year is off to a great start, and we look forward to advancing the clean energy transition with our customers and partners.

Lastly, on behalf of the company and the Board, we want to thank Dave Bennett for a significant contribution to Nextracker and we're thrilled to have him continue as our Chief Accounting Officer. Our new Chief Financial Officer, Chuck Boynton is expected to join Nextracker later this month, and we look forward to Chuck and Dave leading our fabulous finance and accounting teams.

We now look forward to your question. Let me pass the call back to the operator.

Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.

Praneeth Satish

Thanks. Maybe if I could start on the backlog here, another impressive quarter. Can you give us your latest forecast for converting that into revenue? Are you seeing kind of the conversion cycle elongate? I think you've mentioned in the past that typically the majority converts to revenue within a 12-month window. So, just trying to see, if there's any changes to that pattern or kind of a shift towards projects with extended time lines?

Howard Wenger

This is Howard Wenger. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're pleased with the growth of our backlog. Typically, it results in revenue in two to eight quarters and most of that in two to five quarters.

Praneeth Satish

Got it. Okay. And then maybe just switching to the guidance here on 45x credits. Can we assume that based on the guidance that some of that benefit, the 45x credit is going to be shared with customers based on the way you worded it in the form of potentially ASP reductions? Just trying to unpack the difference between 30% gross margin this quarter to high 20%s gross margin for the guidance? And how much of that is based on 45x versus sharing with customers?

David Bennett

Sure. This is Dave. I'll take that, and then Howard can supplement and NTC said, the structural rate that you spoke about, we did increase based on a lot of factors, one of those is the fact that we do have a lower cost vol as a result of the 45x credit. That's just one of the things we use and we spoke about it as we moved through fiscal 2024 into our guide for fiscal 2025, we've also optimized our supply chain. We also need to exercise consistent pricing discipline. All of those come together so in the end the pricing element is set not necessarily specifically to share the 45x. It's a combination of what we put together. We're very focused on maintaining the price that we put out in ensuring the structural margin at the gross margin level in the high 20s, which gets you to a 22% midpoint EBITDA. So that's all baked in. Howard, I don't know if you have anything to add.

Howard Wenger

The only thing I'd add is that the 45x credit is doing what it's set out to do as a policy mechanism, which is to onshore and reshore supply chain to the United States. We've done that, we have over 20 facilities now that are manufacturing components in the United States. So we've really domesticated our product. And it's a mechanism to equilibrate the cost of this local supply chain to what we would have done by importing the product internationally. So it's working. And of course, we're innovating, we're driving down costs which we need to do, and we are lowering price over time in a disciplined manner because that's what the solar industry has done for the last 10 years.

As Dan mentioned in his remarks and showed graphically in the presentation is how big the solar industry has become now. And it is the dominant form of energy in the interconnection queues bigger than the total installed capacity that's serving the US market. So these policies are working and the way we got there to that picture was by driving cost out, scaling up and lowering the price of solar energy to customers, and that's going to continue.

Praneeth Satish

Got it. Thank you. And congrats to Dave and Chuck. Thanks.

Our next question today comes from Philip Shen with Roth MKM. Please begin.

Philip Shen

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong quarter. You guys have had, I think, five quarters in a row since you've been a publicly traded company of about $1 billion of bookings a quarter. This quarter was very strong it seems like at least $1.2 billion. What do you expect for next quarter and the quarter beyond? And how long do you think you can keep this going?

And then, as it relates to the structural margins, can you talk about for the $1.2 billion from FQ4? Would you say that those bookings had the high-20s gross margins? Or is there a chance they're different from what the FY 2025 guide looks like? Thanks guys.

Howard Wenger

Thanks for the question, Phil. I'm not going to confirm or deny the $1.2 billion, but I will confirm that we did book more than $1 billion in the quarter. And so, we are happy with our performance. It's consistent with the previous quarters, as you've mentioned. And as far as the macro going forward, the market is really strong. You saw what's in the interconnection queue our pipeline continues to be robust. I know you like that word, and it's the truth. Demand is strong in the US. It's also strong in multiple regions around the world.

As for the margin question, we're not guiding to that or providing more color on that at this time. And we really are not giving guidance for bookings and going forward. But I appreciate the question. Dave, did you have anything else you wanted to add?

David Bennett

No. Phil, I mean you hit it. We're looking at the entire year for the margin that is weighted across all quarters. Certainly, we execute on cost downs quarter-over-quarter. So we're going to continue to do that. So the profitability as these roll out may be on a different cost base. So all in, we've given the full weighted margin for the year of fiscal 2025, and we're committed to that higher structural margin, which is approaching that 30% gross margin.

Philip Shen

Great. Thanks guys. Shifting over to the overall industry with the Southeast Asia, AD CBD, I was wondering if you've seen any impact at all in your conversations with customers. I know you talked about the number of projects being strong and the Q being large, but I was wondering if you see risk at all with the industry slowing down, given the number of headwinds that the industry is facing. Thanks.

Daniel Shugar

Hey, Phil. Dan Shugar. We haven't seen that issue impact velocity in the market or bookings. Demand is strong. Last week there was the American Clean Power event in Minneapolis. We had other events. I didn't hear any customers bringing that up.

The next question today comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.

Brian Lee

Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Kudos on the nice execution. Maybe first one, just going back to the backlog, I appreciate Howard, the greater than $1 billion bookings disclosure here. So obviously, you did book-to-bill well over 1 in the quarter. Is that true of both the US and international? And then, related to that, I guess the last two years US and rest of world sales mix has been consistent at around 70% to 30%, is that what you'd expect in fiscal 2025 or do you see either geo growing faster this year? And then I had a follow-up.

Howard Wenger

Yes. Thanks. This is Howard again. The answer is that, as far as the last part of your question, we've been remarkably consistent as a company with the two-thirds, one-thirds. If you look at the history of hitting this 100 gigawatt milestone, two-thirds of that was shipped to the US and one-third to international roughly.

And we're seeing that quarter-by-quarter, year-on-year -- year-over-year. So we expect that same mix going forward. We see strong growth in both markets, meaning Rest of World and the US, and don't see that shifting out or go up the balance going one way or the other. Both are growing at roughly the same pace.

Brian Lee

Okay. So growth in both areas, that's good to hear. And then just a follow-up on the margins and the IRA credits discussion here again. Dave, you mentioned during your remarks that there was $60 million roughly more in IRA credits recognized and guided at the midpoint. So I guess, wanted to dive into that a little bit. I would have expected maybe more EBITDA growth apples-to-apples on the mid-teens revenue growth you're guiding for in fiscal 2025 when we're including the IRA RNA impact for both 2024 and 2025. So how much of that pull forward is coming out of 2025 into 2024, you would have otherwise recognized over the next 12 months? And then how much of this -- and maybe it's just the pricing and passing through more of the credit that you mentioned during your remarks as well? Thank you, guys.

David Bennett

Understand. Yes, let me be very clear. None of it was pulled into 2024 from 2025, okay? The beat relative to what we guide was simply due to the evolving of kind of the second half of my prepared remarks, The sentence was and final determination of the realization, you'll see that others deferred a larger portion than we did and determining that element was what was kind of uncertain at the time we did the guidance. We kind of -- and then also we beat with higher revenues as we get for Q4.

So that's really driving the incremental amount in terms of fiscal 2025 and the amount is as we've been talking about, 45X is part of our combination of elements we use to lower the cost. It's a meaningful part of it, it's not the only part, along with what we expect to have some pricing pressures that are normal that Howard spoke to, all of those come together. So to some extent, it is covering some of that pricing pressure to maintain the margin and increase it if I could ask.

Our next question today comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please proceed.

Mark Strouse

Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I apologies for the background noise here. I wanted to go back to Phil's question on AD/CVD. Just assuming that there is an investigation and some of your customers might be looking to switch the type of panels that they are using. Can you talk about how easy that process is? Does that result in a change order with you? And if so, can you talk about who is responsible for bearing that? Is that something that you would share with the customer? Are they on the hook for that?

Daniel Shugar

Hey, Mark, Dan Shugar. Thanks for the question. I'll point out that, first, Solar is a much larger part of the U.S. supply position today than it has been in recent past as sort of thing one. Think too, there's been a homogenization around the mechanical side of Crystal and Solar panels over the last few years, there's basically two classes of panels. The -- I'll call it, 700-watt class and the 605- class or 550-watt class solar panels. So whether it's Nextracker, or a different tracker usually, when you're laying out a system, you need to know. Is it the first order? Is it the lower power class of Crystal power, the higher power plant.

The other thing, I'd point out is that we are making substantially well, the vast majority of the tubes that are going to U.S. projects are happening in the United States. Our lead time is short. Our flexibility is higher, and we just don't see that type of switch being an issue or imposing a significant cost on the customer. It would be my high-level response to that question.

Mark Strouse

Okay. Thanks, Dan. And then just a real quick follow-up, I'll take the rest offline. Last quarter, you talked about [Technical Difficulty] curious if that's still happening or if you're back to normal yet? Thank you.

Daniel Shugar

I'm sorry. You faded out for just a sec, Mark. You said last quarter and then we lost you for a second.

Mark Strouse

Yeah. I'm so sorry. Just an update. Last quarter you talked about the Red Sea rerouting some of your shipping. Is that still happening or are you back to normal?

Daniel Shugar

That's a non-material issue for our results this last quarter for our plan. Thanks, Mark.

Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Vikram Bagri with Citi. Please proceed.

Vikram Bagri

Good afternoon, everyone. Dan, you mentioned and we know you've been beating estimates since going public, which is very impressive. When you look ahead, what catalyst do you think could play out that would make you exceed revenues or margins this fiscal year? There are a number of topics on our mind which can make you exceed those targets, whether it's higher conversion or faster conversion of backlog, higher IRAE credits that you're taking in. Just wanted to see from your vantage point, what catalysts do you have on top of mind which would make you exceed the guidance?

And related to that, your peers have indicated that in their backlog they've not shared 45X credits with any of their customers. It's not in their contracts yet. Is that true for you guys as well? Thank you.

Daniel Shugar

Hey, Vikram. Dan Sugar. Thank you for your question. Look, we've covered on prior calls there are a lot of tailwinds in the sector, but the way we roll at Nextracker is we establish plans that are resilient to be able to endure unknowns, and then we want to be able to perform reliably. So are there any number of tailwinds that could allow the plan to be exceeded? Definitely. But we're building a robust plan and managing the business to be able to meet or exceed performance.

With respect to 45X credits, Howard commented what the motivation of those was, was to really focus with on-shoring. I really want to point out something we covered also on a prior call, which is that most of the projects being done in the US today were predicated on much smaller investment tax credits, typically in the 10% region. They're now 30%, in some cases 40%. So the developer owners are enjoying that significant benefit in the increased credit, and that's which is order of magnitude plus higher than what we're talking about for the 45X. So that's our comment on that. Next question, please.

Yes. Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please proceed.

Christine Cho

Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. So could you give us an idea of the breakdown of your BCA, non-BCA, rest of world and US in your backlog? And when we think about pricing pressure that you mentioned at the end of the year, based on your comments, it sounds like you've already baked it into your contracts, but how much of it will depend on what your competitors are doing? Is there some extra cushion in here? And you -- because you guys always talk about being disciplined on pricing, and you're talking about high 20s growth margin. So how do you define discipline on pricing? Where is the right level that you wouldn't go below?

Howard Wenger

Howard Wenger here. Thanks for the questions, Christine. So, we are not breaking out BCAs in our backlog, why? Because we have a strict standard for backlog which the BCAs meet and they're just considered part of our backlog like any other contract or purchase order because they contain deposit, specific project names, specific ship dates. And so -- and the commitment -- a binding commitment. So, we're not breaking it out for that reason backlog is backlog.

As far as pricing and so forth every project is different. And you have to think about these projects, they're in the order of $150 million, $200 million, $300 million, $500 million of investment. And we comprise less than 10% of these projects -- the cost of these projects.

So, being the backbone of the system, being so critical to the operation of the plant for 30 years plus, quality, durability, really, really matter and discerning buyers really pay attention to track record and third-party validation of all of the claims that a company like Nextracker and others make.

So, that said it is -- competition works and capitalism works and we want to continue to drive costs down and prices down over time for our customers, so we can increase the total TAM and that's exactly what we're doing and that's what we plan on doing. Really appreciate the question. Thank you.

Yes. Next question comes from the Dylan Nassano with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.

Dylan Nassano

Yes, hey everyone. Good evening. I just want to go back to the revenue guidance relative to the backlog. So, if I look at the 2024, your initial guidance range and kind of compare that to the backlog of $2.6 million at the time, I mean obviously you ended up beating/raising and you ended up realizing almost 100% of that backlog.

But just comparing that to the guidance for this year relative to the backlog. Where -- I mean it seems like there's some conservatism embedded in there just can you just provide any color on where exactly that would be or anything that would kind of make last year different from this year? Thank you.

Daniel Shugar

Hi Dylan. Yes, I think Howard just really kind of touched on this with the -- it's about individual projects and their timing to delivery and the content of our backlog that we consider BCAs and EPC contracts the same in that backlog now.

So, relative to the rollout Howard touched on it at a two and eight quarter clip, I think in the past that's not meaningfully different, but the specific projects that are in that backlog have a timing to shift now and that really is what supports our guide.

And keep in mind our guide has historically we've proven to you guys that we do factor in the headwinds that can happen I spoke to it every quarter. We kind of factor in a little conservatism relative to weather and other things in logistics may happen that push individual deliveries out that may impact our achieving a number. So, we've factored that into our guide. And overall I think you can see, the strong backlog at a record over $4 billion certainly supports the guidance range.

Our final question today comes from Maheep Mandloi from Mizuho. Please proceed.

Maheep Mandloi

Hey. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on the 45X in the guidance here. Could you just point to how much that would be math suggest it could be somewhere around $100 million?

I'm just trying to understand the target gross margin excluding the vendor credit. In the past you kind of talked about those mid-20s gross margin. It seems like that still works out, but just wanted to double check that. Thank you.

David Bennett

Sure. Thanks for the question, Maheep. The 45X in guidance, speaking to this is just one of the elements that, lowers our cost. It is interchangeable with other elements that lower our costs. So we don't really plan on breaking that out going forward.

For fiscal 2024, we were not guiding to it. The accounting was uncertain. The treatment was uncertain from the treasury. So that was one element we kept separate from our 2024 results.

But going into fiscal 2025 is absolutely operationalized with our procurement, systems our financial systems and is included in our guide, including -- and it was a driver in increasing that structural gross margin profile from the mid-20s up to the high-20s.

And that's something we expect to be able to sustain overtime. And the 45X credit to the extent we receive it, is going to be part of that. That's kind of the extent of what we're going to be breaking it out though.

Daniel Shugar

This is Dan Sugar. I just want to thank the Nextracker team, all our customers, our investors for a fantastic year for fiscal 2024. We're really excited about the industry. We think it's a rising tide here for the industry, for many participants. It's going to -- and these really pipeline numbers we're seeing in the Q, are overwhelming. It's very exciting.

So we're on a path here with solar to be the number one source of energy in the U.S. and the world. And it's great to be part of it. If we didn't get to your question, apologies for that, but we will speak to you in the callbacks. Thank you very much.

That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you, all for your participation.

Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are developing a green energy plan to link their power grids with an eye towards exporting electricity to the European Union.

The energy ministers of the three countries announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding in early May to explore their joint electricity export potential by harnessing mainly wind and solar power. Kazakhstan is also aiming to boost its hydropower generating capacity. In outlining cooperation plans, the tripartite memo envisions the laying of a ""high-voltage cable"" on the Caspian Sea's seabed. Technical specifications for such a transmission line have already been developed, according to Kazakh Energy Minister Almassadam Satkaliyev.

""A proposed business model will be developed for the development of international transmission corridors (financing, revenue flow and ownership) and for the sale of green energy to the countries of the European Union,"" a ministry statement quoted Satkaliyev as saying.

The three countries have wasted little time in pursuing the plan. Satkaliiev said May 10 that a feasibility study was underway. He told journalists that the EU had given the budding consortium an expression of ""interest in purchasing clean electricity."" The feasibility study will work out construction and financing details and is expected to produce preliminary estimates by the end of the year. It is too early to put a price tag on the project, or the amount of power exports involved.

""We are talking about a fairly large amount of investment,"" Satkaliyev said.

The effort to foster trans-Caspian connectivity inherent in the tripartite memorandum dovetails with an economic blueprint proposed by the United States, dubbed the B5+1, under which Central Asian states take the initiative in breaking down regional trade barriers and forging new networks to boost trade and investment. Since the B5+1's inception in March, Central Asian states have taken steps to simplify trade rules. The tripartite memo marks a significant step in promoting regional cooperation extending beyond Central Asia to span the Caspian Sea.

The goal of exporting electricity to the EU fits in with plans unveiled by all three countries to significantly expand renewable energy generating capacity in the coming years.

The chief catalyst for power exports is Uzbekistan, which aims to generate an additional 20 Gigawatts (GW) via renewable sources by 2030. Meeting that target would raise the country's total renewable capacity to 27 GW. By April, the government had signed deals to develop wind and solar facilities projected to produce 12 GWs. In May, Uzbekistan entered into contracts for another 6 GW.

""Increasing the efficiency of the energy industry is relevant for our entire region,"" Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said during a Tashkent investor's forum in early May.

Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan seem destined to play more of a facilitating role in the power export arrangement. Given its abundance of fossil fuels, Astana's renewable goals seem more modest than Uzbekistan's. Kazakhstan currently generates about 2.9 GW of power via renewable sources, and hopes to add at least another 5 GW by 2030, according to Satkaliyev. Much of that capacity may be needed at home, however, as Kazakhstan grapples with a power deficit that saw the country become a net importer of electricity in 2023.

Azerbaijan has a target of generating 5 GW of solar and wind power by 2030. The MoU Baku entered into with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan potentially builds on a 2023 agreement that Azerbaijan concluded with EU states, including Hungary and Romania, to export power via an underwater cable traversing the Black Sea with a capacity of 1,000 Megawatts. The feasibility study for the Black Sea project was conducted prior to Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022, thus raising questions about its viability under wartime conditions.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,,0.2078431372549019,453424151,13,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/a-4.png,

Full transcript - Veolia Environnement (EPA: VIE ) VE (OTC: VEOEY ) Q1 2024:

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year. And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know. EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know. I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter. As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price. How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy. As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia. Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation. Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates. Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few. The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry. The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments. Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell. This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027. I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins. In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion. In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan. On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed. District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect. As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia. On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan. In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe. Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027. On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants. And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2. On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million. I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada. In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez. Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak. The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi. All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents. In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year. We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1. And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group. These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts. 85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years. We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular. We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed. Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably. To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants. The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now. And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia. So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce. On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS. I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle: Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses. Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA. Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level. Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts. On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge. Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin. For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe. Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S. In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes. Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi. North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%. In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations. Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation. Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1. I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group. And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed. In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation. Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung (KS: 005930 ) contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases. The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech. I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America. To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability. We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year. In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized. Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%. On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent. On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong. I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule. In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America. Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe. EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable. Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023. Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany. The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year. Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's (NYSE: MCO ) with a stable outlook. Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains. More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).

Arthur Sitbon: So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year. And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question. The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that. So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can. And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks. As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can. And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit. In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year. I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada. So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies. In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important. In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well. Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much. And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities. And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%. So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).

Ajay Patel: Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution? And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down. And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Claude Laruelle: Total usage.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel: Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why. PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same. So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those. But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate. So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS. How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that. High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business. So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned. So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution. And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again. So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of. We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick. On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel: I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff: I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Ajay Patel: Water volume. I'm sorry.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one. Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers. So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically. A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay. So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank (ETR: DBKGn ).

Olly Jeffery: So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there. And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please? And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

Claude Laruelle: On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity. And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China. In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization. On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024. So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff: And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce. And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition. How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place. So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery: That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping: I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water. And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great. And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive. I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable. So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold. And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years. Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S. As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle: So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech. And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen? I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).

Alexandre Roncier: I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter? And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business. So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation. In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm. In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime. So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026. And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez: I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat? And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question. And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle: So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital. And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan. But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect. And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth. In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative. So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things. So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez: I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit. So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus. Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards. Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution. And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times. And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle: Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff: That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle. It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one. And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters. So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies. So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range. When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027. I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on. And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Operator: Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

The Biden administration says the tariffs, announced today, will ensure that cheap Chinese imports don't decimate the emerging U.S. clean energy manufacturing industry and its job growth potential, which the president has poured billions of dollars into boosting. The administration is quadrupling the current tariff on EVs to 100 percent and doubling tariffs on solar components to 50 percent, as well as sharply increasing duties on steel, aluminum and batteries.

But some economists worry that cutting off cheap supplies could slow the deployment of clean energy at a time when the climate desperately needs it, write Sara Schonhardt, Benjamin Storrow and Scott Waldman.

""If you don't get that balance right, you're ultimately just making sure American consumers can't get low-cost, high-quality products,"" said Ilaria Mazzocco with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

That tension is particularly palpable within the solar industry, which has long been divided over tariffs. Solar manufacturers say levies are needed to keep U.S. companies competitive with Chinese ones, while developers insist the tariffs slow deployment and raise electricity prices.

The political angle: Biden's tariffs expand ones that former President Donald Trump implemented in 2018, reflecting a bipartisan consensus that U.S. industries need protection from Chinese imports.

But as Biden and Trump try to one-up each other on tariffs -- in a bid to appeal to Midwestern voters -- their approaches diverge, writes Gavin Bade.

Trump has promised to slap a 10 percent tariff on all foreign imports and 60 percent duties on China. He also wants to impose steep auto tariffs on Mexico if it does not block Chinese-made EVs from being shipped into the U.S.

Together, Trump's proposals could upend North America's auto supply chains and dramatically increase the price of cars. In contrast, Biden's approach is expected to have only muted effects on the U.S. economy.

Automakers have ""spent a lot of time developing supply chains that are designed to accommodate the existing rules,"" said Bill Reinsch, who was undersecretary of Commerce for export administration during the Clinton administration. ""When you come in suddenly and just throw all the rules away, basically, you're telling them once again, you have to totally reorient your supply chains.""

Today in POLITICO Energy's podcast: Catherine Morehouse breaks down the details of potentially historic rules from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the reaction from the Hill and industry.

A new VP for Trump?

Trump fueled speculation that he might select Republican Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota as his running mate over the weekend when the two lavished praise on each other during a rally in New Jersey, writes Robin Bravender.

Burgum is friendly with the oil and gas industry and wants his state to become carbon neutral. The wealthy former software executive -- first elected as the fossil fuel-producing state's governor in 2016 -- says he believes in ""innovation over regulation.""

Swing state Democrat's energy bid

Through a new cap-and-trade program, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is attempting to advance clean energy in a fossil fuel-dependent state without sacrificing labor and business concerns, writes Jordan Wolman.

If he succeeds, it could drive support for Democrats' climate and energy agenda -- and Shapiro's own political ambitions.

Hungary hesitates over sanctions

Hungary has expressed significant reservations about a new European Union proposal to penalize Russia's lucrative natural gas sector, write Gabriel Gavin, Victor Jack and Camille Gijs.

""We are going to analyze the package but do not support anything that might have a negative impact on [the] EU gas market,"" a top Hungarian official said during a meeting of diplomats Wednesday, according to two diplomats with knowledge of the discussions.

In recent years, under the strategic guidance of the leaders of both countries, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been aligned with Hungary's ""Opening to the East"" policy, resulting in fruitful cooperation across various sectors.

Significant achievements have been made in green development areas such as new energy vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and photovoltaic products, injecting new impetus into the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Hungary.

The automotive industry is one of the pillars of Hungary's economy. More than 10 out of the top 20 global automobile manufacturers have established vehicle manufacturing plants or automotive component production bases in Hungary.

To embrace green transformation in the transportation sector, the Hungarian government launched an electric vehicle development plan in 2016. Chinese electric vehicle companies have been closely cooperating with Hungarian counterparts, and their brand recognition has been continuously increasing.

In April 2017, an electric bus factory of Chinese new energy vehicle manufacturer BYD in north Hungary's Komarom officially started production. It is BYD's first electric vehicle factory established in Europe.

In September 2022, Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO's first overseas factory was put into use in Biatorbagy, Hungary. The factory serves as NIO's manufacturing, service, and research center for charging products in Europe, providing local consumers with battery swapping stations.

In January this year, BYD set up a new energy vehicle production base in Hungary's Szeged, which is the sixth Chinese automotive manufacturing plant in Hungary and is expected to offer thousands of job opportunities.

""Hungary has a mature industrial chain for automotive manufacturing. While leveraging Hungary's advantages in the industry, we are bringing advanced manufacturing techniques and highly automated production lines to the Hungarian market from China, so as to support the electrification of the Hungarian automotive industry and promote technological exchange and innovation between China and Hungary,"" said an executive from BYD.

Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said that the automotive manufacturing sector is a pillar industry in Hungary, and attracting Chinese investment is crucial for strengthening Hungary's position in global new energy vehicle development.

Power batteries are key components of new energy vehicles, accounting for approximately 40 percent of the total vehicle cost. With advantages such as fast charging, long range, and high safety, Chinese lithium-ion batteries have become an important aspect of China-Hungary cooperation in the field of new energy.

In March 2022, Chinese lithium-ion battery company EVE Energy Co., Ltd. (EVE) announced a plan to build a factory in Debrecen, Hungary to produce cylindrical cells.

Five months later, Chinese battery manufacturer and technology company CATL also announced to build a battery plant in the city, which will become one of the largest battery factories in Europe once completed.

Additionally, other Chinese power battery companies and related material enterprises, such as SEMCORP, Huayou Cobalt, and Sunwoda, have also started building factories in Hungary.

The investment of Chinese battery companies like CATL in Hungary has stimulated the development of the Hungarian battery industry, and factories built by Chinese carmakers including BYD in Hungary have also promoted the development of the local automotive industry, said Andrea Nagyne Boda, head of the International Cooperation and Development Finance Department at the Ministry for National Economy of Hungary.

Hungary-China cooperation projects not only benefit the Hungarian people but also contribute to the entire Europe's enjoyment of the benefits of new energy, Andrea added.

Hungary's electricity import stands at around 30 percent. In order to diversify the country's energy supply, the Hungarian government has been actively exploring solar energy resources and developing the photovoltaic industry.

In June 2019, China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) under China General Technology (Group) Holding Co., Ltd., invested in a 100 MW solar park in Kaposvar, Hungary, which is one of the largest renewable energy facilities in Hungary.

Since its operation in 2021, the solar farm has generated over 140 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, which is equivalent to saving 45,000 tons of standard coal and reducing 120,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions on an annual basis.

CMC implemented a series of environmentally friendly measures when the solar farm was constructed. For instance, it replaced impact piles with spiral pile photovoltaic brackets to minimize land damage. It hired landscape experts for ecological planning and conducted large-scale greening around the factory area.

Kaposvar's mayor Karoly Szita said that the Kaposvar solar farm is not only an exemplary collaboration in clean energy between Hungary and China but also a testament to the friendship between the two countries.

""Green transformation is a global trend, and the development of new energy is crucial for restructuring global energy supply. China has provided us with excellent opportunities in this field, and the deepening of green cooperation between our two countries has achieved mutual benefits and win-win outcomes,"" said Marton Bokay, deputy state secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of Economic Development.",lapost.us,news,lapost.us,,0.1607843137254903,453418762,78,,eng-9569620

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year. And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know. EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know. I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter. As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price. How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy. As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia. Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation. Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates. Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few. The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry. The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments. Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell. This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027. I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins. In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion. In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan. On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed. District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect. As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia. On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan. In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe. Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027. On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants. And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2. On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million. I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada. In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez. Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak. The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi. All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents. In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year. We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1. And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group. These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts. 85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years. We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular. We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed. Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably. To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants. The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now. And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia. So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce. On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS. I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle: Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses. Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA. Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level. Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts. On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge. Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin. For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe. Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S. In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes. Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi. North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%. In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations. Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation. Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1. I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group. And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed. In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation. Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung (KS:005930) contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases. The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech. I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America. To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability. We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year. In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized. Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%. On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent. On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong. I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule. In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America. Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe. EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable. Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023. Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany. The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year. Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) with a stable outlook. Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains. More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley.

Arthur Sitbon: So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year. And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question. The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that. So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can. And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks. As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can. And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit. In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year. I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada. So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies. In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important. In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well. Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much. And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities. And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%. So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs.

Ajay Patel: Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution? And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down. And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Claude Laruelle: Total usage.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel: Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why. PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same. So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those. But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate. So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS. How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that. High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business. So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned. So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution. And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again. So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of. We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick. On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel: I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff: I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Ajay Patel: Water volume. I'm sorry.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one. Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers. So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically. A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay. So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank.

Olly Jeffery: So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there. And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please? And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff: Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

Claude Laruelle: On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity. And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China. In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization. On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024. So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff: And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce. And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition. How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place. So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery: That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping: I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water. And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great. And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive. I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable. So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold. And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years. Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S. As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle: So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech. And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen? I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America.

Alexandre Roncier: I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter? And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business. So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation. In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm. In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime. So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026. And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez: I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat? And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question. And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle: So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital. And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff: Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan. But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect. And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth. In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative. So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things. So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez: I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit. So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus. Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards. Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution. And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times. And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle: Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff: That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle. It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one. And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle: Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters. So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies. So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range. When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian: Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff: So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027. I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on. And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Operator: Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff: Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are developing a green energy plan to link their power grids with an eye towards exporting electricity to the European Union.

The energy ministers of the three countries announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding in early May to explore their joint electricity export potential by harnessing mainly wind and solar power. Kazakhstan is also aiming to boost its hydropower generating capacity. In outlining cooperation plans, the tripartite memo envisions the laying of a ""high-voltage cable"" on the Caspian Sea's seabed. Technical specifications for such a transmission line have already been developed, according to Kazakh Energy Minister Almassadam Satkaliyev.

""A proposed business model will be developed for the development of international transmission corridors (financing, revenue flow and ownership) and for the sale of green energy to the countries of the European Union,"" a ministry statement quoted Satkaliyev as saying.

The three countries have wasted little time in pursuing the plan. Satkaliiev said May 10 that a feasibility study was underway. He told journalists that the EU had given the budding consortium an expression of ""interest in purchasing clean electricity."" The feasibility study will work out construction and financing details and is expected to produce preliminary estimates by the end of the year. It is too early to put a price tag on the project, or the amount of power exports involved.

""We are talking about a fairly large amount of investment,"" Satkaliyev said.

The effort to foster trans-Caspian connectivity inherent in the tripartite memorandum dovetails with an economic blueprint proposed by the United States, dubbed the B5+1, under which Central Asian states take the initiative in breaking down regional trade barriers and forging new networks to boost trade and investment. Since the B5+1's inception in March, Central Asian states have taken steps to simplify trade rules. The tripartite memo marks a significant step in promoting regional cooperation extending beyond Central Asia to span the Caspian Sea.

The goal of exporting electricity to the EU fits in with plans unveiled by all three countries to significantly expand renewable energy generating capacity in the coming years.

The chief catalyst for power exports is Uzbekistan, which aims to generate an additional 20 Gigawatts (GW) via renewable sources by 2030. Meeting that target would raise the country's total renewable capacity to 27 GW. By April, the government had signed deals to develop wind and solar facilities projected to produce 12 GWs. In May, Uzbekistan entered into contracts for another 6 GW.

""Increasing the efficiency of the energy industry is relevant for our entire region,"" Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said during a Tashkent investor's forum in early May.

Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan seem destined to play more of a facilitating role in the power export arrangement. Given its abundance of fossil fuels, Astana's renewable goals seem more modest than Uzbekistan's. Kazakhstan currently generates about 2.9 GW of power via renewable sources, and hopes to add at least another 5 GW by 2030, according to Satkaliyev. Much of that capacity may be needed at home, however, as Kazakhstan grapples with a power deficit that saw the country become a net importer of electricity in 2023.

Azerbaijan has a target of generating 5 GW of solar and wind power by 2030. The MoU Baku entered into with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan potentially builds on a 2023 agreement that Azerbaijan concluded with EU states, including Hungary and Romania, to export power via an underwater cable traversing the Black Sea with a capacity of 1,000 Megawatts. The feasibility study for the Black Sea project was conducted prior to Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022, thus raising questions about its viability under wartime conditions.",polandsun.com,news,Poland Sun,,0.3019607843137255,453410838,13,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/ZDE5MTE2YjYtZDE.jpg,

Claude Laruelle - Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Veolia Q1 2024 Key Figures Conference Call with Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO; and Claude Laruelle, CFO. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded May 14, 2024.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Estelle Brachlianoff. Please go ahead.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this conference call to present Veolia's results for the first quarter of '24. And with me is Claude Laruelle, our Chief Financial Officer.

Our first quarter results are, once again, excellent. They are perfectly in line with our annual objective and enable us to start 2024 with great confidence and fully confirm our guidance for the year.

And I'm on Slide 4 where you would see sales came to €11.5 billion, up 3.9%, excluding energy price, which are essentially pass-through for us, as you know.

EBITDA has increased by substantial 5.7% on a like-for-like basis to €1.624 billion and current EBIT by 11.1% to €843 million. Net financial debt is well under control and in line with our target of leverage ratio below 3x at year-end. These results are the fruit of our unique positioning as the world's leader of environmental services, which, combined with the sustained effort and professional efficiency enables us to deliver both resilience and growth of our results. The last few months have confirmed the choices of our next strategic program, GreenUp, which, for instance, the critical importance for both cities and industries of deploying solutions to tackle water scarcity and onshore water quality, those challenges where Veolia has a leadership position, as you know.

I'm on Slide 5. And you can see we registered very solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy price, fueled in particular by Water and Waste, which grew by 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively.

Regarding Energy, as anticipated, lower energy price has weighted on our top line, but our Energy revenue has been flat, excluding the effect of energy price and has even grown by 1% if you exclude negative weather effect in the first quarter.

As you know, our Energy margin as in EBITDA is well protected from the ups and downs of energy price, which showed again in the first quarter. Actually, we expect 2024 Energy EBITDA to remain at the high level we reached last year despite lower energy price.

How is that so? Veolia is quite unique in the energy market since we operate in local energy only as we explained last January during our deep dive dedicated to energy.

As I've said, we anticipated this, which is the reason why we have published our revenue growth, excluding energy price, each quarter since 2022 as they do not impact our performance. Energy is a profitable and growing activity for Veolia.

Slide 6. In order to detail how we've delivered another quarter of very good results, I would like to start by briefly explaining Veolia's recipe for value creation, which lies in 3 key engines: top line growth, efficiency and capital allocation.

Starting with revenue growth. We combined stronghold activities, which were very resilient essential services, infrastructure-like with three growth boosters, namely, water technologies and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency. Our stronghold activities enjoy security and high contract renewal rates.

Anchored in those, our booster activities grew at mid- to high single-digit rates as they are driven by strong market trends and Veolia's unique positioning, water quality and scarcity, regulation to protect health and reshoring, just to mention a few.

The second pillar of value creation is our strict management of operations and attention to delivery. Each year, we deliver €350 million of efficiency gains, which have been topped up by cost synergies of the Suez merger, an addition of €500 million over 5 years -- 4 years, sorry.

The third pillar is our capital allocation. We target high value-creating projects or tuck-in acquisitions in line with our strategic priorities. So typically our 3 growth boosters, all the geographies in which we want to expand. Our internal rule is IRR above WACC plus 4% and ROCE above WACC after year 3 for these investments.

Meanwhile, we constantly review our portfolio of assets to check if there is still some value creation ahead. If not or when the asset is not in line with our strategy, typically construction or FM activities or subscale presence, we may decide to sell.

This value creation model is the backbone of our GreenUp plan with current net income growth of 10% per annum on average and the dividend growing in line with EPS and ROCE post-tax above 9% in 2027.

I'm on Slide 8, and let me detail now each of those 3 pillars of value creation and the way they have translated into Q1 results, starting with top line growth. In Q1, we delivered solid revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, thanks to continued strong foundation with regards to indexation, pricing, contract renewal and new wins.

In addition to a particularly strong performance in the Water Tech booster, both in delivery and new order book, up 50% in Q1 to €1.8 billion.

In terms of geographies, Australia, the Middle East and the U.S., which you know are our growth boosters, performed particularly well, each of them above 6% growth, which is aligned with our ambition laid in our GreenUp plan.

On Page 9, you have a focus on the performance of activities defined as stronghold in our GreenUp plan, which performed very well in Q1. Water municipal operations and Solid Waste revenue progressed very well, thanks to commercial momentum, better volumes, [indiscernible] indexation and continued pricing power. So 30% of our contracts, which are not indexed.

District heating networks were flat, excluding energy price, due to mild weather in Central and Eastern Europe, but will have progressed otherwise. All registered strong commercial wins, notably the renewal of the SEDIF contract, which I'm very pleased with, as you would expect.

As you know, and I'm now on Page 10, this contract provides water services for 4 million inhabitants in 132 municipalities around Paris for a total revenue of €4 billion over 12 years. We managed to renew this contract, thanks in particular to a series of very innovative solutions, which will make this contract a worldwide reference of water services of the 21st century with 10 world-firsts. These include the combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to treat all new pollutants from PFAS to pesticide residues or endocrine disruptors as well to AI to help improve network efficiency to 93%, just to mention a few. As you can see, innovation is really at the heart of what we do at Veolia.

On Page 11, now we'll focus on the performance of our GreenUp booster activities in Q1. Water Technologies continued to perform excessively well in terms of sales, earnings and bookings. Revenue grew by 15% in all our lines of business within Water Tech, while booking increased by 50% to €1.8 billion, including another big success in desalination in Dubai at Hassyan.

In local decarbonizing energy, we continue to grow in flexibility with a 430-megawatt assets acquired from Uniper in Hungary, which will complement our own asset -- set of assets in this country. As you know, with this promising and strategic market, which is critical to the grid given the development of renewables, and with this operation, Veolia now has 2.4 gigawatts of managed flexible electrical energy in Europe.

Still in local decarbonizing energy. In France, we are installing a series of solar panels on our landfills, which will produce 300 megawatts of green electricity by 2027.

On Slide 12, you can see a list of some of the bookings in Water Tech we have recorded in Q1 with several contracts in semiconductors or oil and gas. On the Hassyan desalination project, I'm very proud that we'll have, with this one, the most energy-efficient worldwide desalination in the world and not a small one because it will serve 2 million inhabitants.

And actually, when I said energy-efficient, we have crossed the floor of 3-kilowatt hour per cubic meter of water produced, which seemed unreachable only 10 years ago and which is a 35% reduction compared to 10 years ago and even 5x lower than the project we designed 30 years ago. You can see with this example that Veolia innovation helps save energy, money and CO2.

On Slide 14, now let's deep dive into our second lever of value creation, which is performance and efficiency. You can see on this slide our first quarter performance in terms of operating efficiency and synergies. In terms of efficiency, we achieved €88 million in gains, in line with our annual target of €350 million.

I'm pleased to see the specific action plan launched in France late last year bear its first fruits in Q1. In addition, we have fixed or exited a few underperforming contracts, notably one in Canada.

In terms of cost synergies derived from the Suez merger, we are ahead of schedule and have achieved €42 million in Q1, or cumulative of €357 million since the start of the merger with Suez.

Safe to say that the efficiency program are now part of the DNA and will remain so, leveraging on our more than 3,000 plants and units worldwide. But we are constantly looking for new tools and new opportunities, such as GenAI now, which we have dozen tests underway as we speak.

The last driver of our value creation is capital allocation where we were particularly active in Q1, and I'm on Slide 16. Our CapEx program continued at a sustained pace with ongoing projects to build new hazardous waste treatment facilities in the U.S., Germany and Saudi.

All those projects will be commissioned in 2025 and will fuel growth and increase return in this activity, which is among the 3 boosters of our GreenUp plan. As you know, Hazardous Waste already accounts for 10% of group sales and we are the world leader present on all continents.

In parallel, we continued the conversion plan of our coal-fired facilities with €95 million invested during the first quarter in Poland and the Czech Republic. We expect a double-digit return from our decarbonization CapEx and are already benefiting from the higher profitability of our new Braunschweig facility, which was converted last year.

We have been quite active in terms of bolt-on acquisition as well from Uniper flexibility assets in Hungary to recycling activities in Germany. Those two tuck-ins are a perfect illustration of our business model as they complement our existing asset footprint perfectly and generate significant synergies from day 1.

And on February 29, we completed the disposal of Sade, as this construction activity, mainly in France, was noncore and with an EBITDA margin of around 5% dilutive for the rest of the group.

These very good results in Q1 confirms the strength of our business model, which we summarize on Slide 18. Veolia is very resilient as we provide social services, both to municipal and industrial clients, with full asset ownership and more than 90% of renewal contracts.

85% of sales are not exposed to the economic cycle. We are protected against inflation, thanks to contract indexation formulas and our pricing power as we've proven and sustained in the last 3 years.

We enjoy leadership position in all our key countries, which has proven key to pricing power, in particular.

We benefit from balanced geographical footprint with 40% outside Europe, of which more than $5 billion in the U.S., no country outside the U.S. with more than 10% of the group's capital employed.

Of course, in addition to these strengths, Veolia enjoys growth thanks to supportive megatrends and the unique positioning as the world leader of environmental services. Water quality, water scarcity, socioeconomic challenges, hazardous waste treatment, decarbonization are here to stay and we are the key to enabling our customers to grow sustainably.

To illustrate our unique positioning, I'm now on Slide 19, let me give this example of PFAS, which is the case in point. Thanks to our innovation and the set of patented technologies we've developed, which includes membranes and resins as well as high-temperature incineration, we are now ready to treat these emerging pollutants.

The combination of our various businesses in Water Technologies, Water operations as well as Hazardous Waste enable us to offer an end-to-end solution. Our presence in the U.S. when those pollutants were first detected has helped us to anticipate and be ready to treat this pollutant in Europe now.

And actually things are moving fast in PFAS. In the first quarter alone, we've seen in the U.S. two new regulations from the EPA, which represents an estimated market for remediation and solutions estimated to $250 billion in the U.S. alone. Veolia has already started to treat PFAS [indiscernible] with water in [indiscernible] water in France, in the U.S. and in Australia.

So I'm now on Slide 20. Veolia is a unique global leader in environmental services, ideally positioned to address fast-growing demand trends across the globe from water scarcity to decarbonization and decontamination to protection and health as the case of PFAS strategy illustrates. Our international presence in 44 countries and in the top 3 niche of our key countries is a key success factor as much as our strongly engaged workforce.

On Slide 21, the very strong Q1 results allow me to fully confirm our target for 2024 and are very much in line with our GreenUp objectives. The financial and nonfinancial objective of our strategic plan are summarized in this slide. They include current net income growth of an average of 10% per year with dividends growing in line with EPS.

I now hand over to Claude who will detail the Q1 '24 results before we both dive to your questions. Claude?

Claude Laruelle

Thank you, Estelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on Slide 23. And as Estelle already highlighted, our Q1 2024 results are, once again, remarkable and allow us to be very confident for the rest of the year. With €11.5 billion revenue, we experienced a good organic revenue growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, driven by good commercial momentum and improved Water and Waste volumes, continued favorable indexation on our long-term contracts and price increases on nonindexed businesses.

Taking into account the impact of lower energy prices, revenue was down by 1.7%, as expected, without impact on EBITDA.

Thanks to the operating leverage and the good delivery of synergies, we enjoyed a solid organic EBITDA growth of 5.7% at €1.624 billion and a current EBIT growth of 11.1% at €843 million. Net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. You can also see on the slide the detailed ForEx impact, which were negative in Q1, minus €228 million at revenue level and minus €58 million at EBITDA level.

Assuming the exchange rates remain at today's level, the full year impact at EBITDA level would be between €70 million and €80 million. As a reminder, as we operate in local currency, ForEx impacts are only translation and not transaction impacts.

On Slide 24, you have our usual revenue bridge detailing the different effects and showing our top line intrinsic growth of 4.5% composed of commercial wins and pricing, those two green boxes on the right-hand side of the bridge.

Looking at the full bridge in more details, what do we see? First, ForEx had a negative impact of minus 1.9%, mostly in Latin America. Second, scope impact is limited, minus 0.1%, after Sade disposal in February and a few tuck-ins. As a reminder, Sade is a construction business with low margin.

For organic growth, we continued to enjoy solid growth of 3.9%, excluding energy prices, which is fueled by good commercial momentum, volume growth, strong growth activities, price and indexation increase in Water and Waste. The main item on the bridge is, of course, the lower energy prices for €679 million, with almost no impact on EBITDA. Recyclate prices have stabilized and the impact is insignificant in Q1 at revenue and EBITDA levels. The weather impact was unfavorable, minus 0.4%, compared to 2023, which was already mild. We experienced, in fact, the warmest winter over the last 30 years in Central Europe.

Moving to Slide 25. You can see the revenue evolution by geographical segment and I start with Water Technologies, which delivered another very strong quarter, both in terms of revenue and bookings. Revenue are up 15% with sustained growth in all our business lines. And in terms of bookings, as Estelle said, we registered a record level of bookings of €1.8 billion, including more than €600 million in the U.S.

In the Rest of the World, all regions performed very well. Notably, Australia had a very strong growth of 8.5%, thanks to good Waste performance, several contract wins, strict pricing discipline and good landfill volumes.

Latin America grew double digits, thanks to good Waste volumes and pricing. Underlying activity was well oriented in Brazil, Chile and Colombia with several new contracts. To take a few, Las Salinas in Chile for soil remediation or Braskem biomass in Brazil. Africa/Middle East revenue was up 4%, thanks to strong business in Morocco and new energy efficiency contracts in the Middle East in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi.

North America continued to enjoy solid Hazardous Waste performance and good Water activity. In Hazardous waste, for example, we benefited from a favorable mix effect and average prices are up 7%.

In Asia, solid growth in Hong Kong, plus 10%, with a very strong performance of our Waste activity and our Energy efficiency business. And in Japan, it was up 4.7% with strong performance of Water operations.

Rest of Europe revenue was up 1%, excluding energy prices. In Central Europe, the impact of lower energy prices in district heating activity was partially offset by the very good Water activity. In Northern Europe, we registered an outstanding U.K. performance, good indexation and strong PFI activity with a weaker availability of 98%. Southern Europe enjoyed strong commercial and Water activity and improved tariff indexation.

Finally, France and Hazardous Waste Europe. After a difficult 2023, we're turning the tide. Revenue grew by 2.7%, an improvement after only 1.4% in 2023, thanks to good performance in Water and Waste. We also initiated profitability enhancement actions in France with a strong commercial focus and very specific efficiency targets with quick returns. As a result, France EBITDA is up 5% in Q1.

I'm on Slide 26. And you can see the main trend by activity that I will detail in the next slide. Water and Waste enjoyed a very good work in Q1 as we expected and are fueling the revenue and the EBITDA growth of the group.

And we review our activities one by one and I'll start with Water on Slide 27, our largest activity, representing 40% of our revenue. Water business grew by 6.5%, driven actually by volume/commerce, plus 3%; and pricing, plus 3.6% thanks to, first, good volumes especially in Central Europe, plus 4.2%; Morocco, plus 2.4%; and France, plus 0.5%; continued favorable tariff indexation in France, for example, plus 4.5%; and in Central Europe, high-single digits in average. The quarter was, of course, marked by the signing of the new SEDIF contract for 12 years, which Estelle already detailed.

In regulated water, in particular, in the U.S., volumes were up 3% and we concluded several favorable rate case negotiations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And in Chile, for Aguas Sandinas, volumes were stable and we have continued favorable price indexation.

Q1 was also marked by an outstanding Water Technology performance, in particular, the membrane business with increased sales of our AERO Products, the project business with the beginning of the Samsung contract and the St. Louis sludge project, both in the U.S., and the chemical products with strong volumes and price increases.

The commercial activity remained very strong, and we have a very large pipeline of projects ahead of us. As Estelle highlighted, we have just booked a very large desalination project in Dubai for $320 million that will continue to fuel the growth of Water Tech.

I'm moving to Slide 28 on Waste. Waste activities grew at a faster pace than in previous quarter by 5.5% compared to 3.4% in 2023, thanks to continued pricing power, improved volumes in Europe and good commercial momentum in Australia and Latin America.

To take a few examples. In Europe, the U.K. had a very good start to the year with very strong PFI and also C&I performance. In Germany, we had a strong commercial activity and we stabilized the volumes. France was better than last year in terms of volumes and also in terms of profitability.

We managed our electricity from our sales well, thanks to our hedging policy with selling prices higher than last year.

In Australia, the activity remained well oriented with the start of new municipal contracts and good volumes. Recycled prices at only minus 0.7% impact as the main drop of recycled prices happened in the second part of 2022. And our prices are more or less stabilized.

Hazardous Waste remained well oriented in almost all our geographies, and we continue to experience good pricing power in the U.S. Finally, on Slide 29, Energy activity decreased by 16.5% due to energy prices and the milder weather. Intrinsic energy growth was 1.1%. Thanks to our business model with index tariff and energy prices essentially passed through and thanks to our hedging policy, we have been able to protect our results. Energy EBITDA was quite stable in Q1 and should remain stable in the full year at a very high level. Weather was again unfavorable due to a very mild winter in Central Europe with an impact of minus 1%.

On our district heating business, as expected, we continued to benefit from heat price increases by the regulators in Central Europe as there is a lag effect. We also benefited from the ramp-up of our very large district heating contract in Tashkent.

On the electricity side, we benefited from our hedging policy, which enabled us to mitigate the market price evolution. We also started new high-efficiency cogeneration with higher EBITDA, such as Braunschweig in Germany and [indiscernible] in Czech Republic. And we have more to come with Poznan in Poland in 2025. Finally, we signed significant new energy efficiency contracts in Belgium, Italy, the Middle East and Hong Kong.

I'm now on Page 30, where you have our usual EBITDA bridge. We delivered a strong EBITDA growth of 5.7% like-for-like, fueled by the combination of the solid underlying revenue growth, strong efficiencies and synergies ahead of schedule.

In detail, scope included the disposal of Sade from March 1 and the integration of bolt-on assets in Germany. ForEx negative impact reached minus €58 million, mainly in Latin America.

Energy and recyclate impact was slightly negative, minus 1.8%, as we expected. EBITDA for Energy business was quite stable in Q1. Weather had an impact of minus 1.2% with the mild winter in Central Europe.

EBITDA intrinsic growth was, therefore, fueled by the following effect: a more robust commerce and volume impact for plus 3.6%, continuous strong net efficiency and synergies for 5.1%. The synergy delivery continues to be ahead of target, reaching €42 million in Q1 and €357 million accumulated since the closing of the acquisition of Suez, which is remarkable.

Moving to Slide 31. Let's see how the EBITDA increase is fueling the current EBIT, which is growing very strongly by 11.1% at €833 million. Renewable expense of €72 million are comparable with Q1 last year. Amortization, OFA and provision at €731 million is slightly down compared to 2023 with amortization slightly up due to the ramp-up of our contract in Uzbekistan and less impairment and provision than in 2023. JVs amounts to €22 million compared to €28 million last year, essentially due to a one-off in 2023.

Our net financial debt remained well under control at €19 billion. CapEx remained quite stable and included €95 million of decarbonization CapEx with good progress on our Poznan project and €43 million of Hazardous Waste new projects, particularly in the U.S., in the Middle East and in Germany.

The quarterly increase in net financial debt was due first to the seasonal reversal of working capital that was slightly higher than last year due to unfavorable calendar effects. It will not impact the free cash flow delivery of the year. We had higher payments in Q1 to water authorities in Water France and in CO2 products in Central Europe. And second, to the €200 million hybrid debt final repayment after the renewal of our €600 million hybrid debt in November last year.

Our solid investment-grade rating has just been confirmed by S&P and Moody's with a stable outlook.

Moving to Slide 33. To conclude, we, of course, confirm our ambitious guidance for 2024. Revenue, continued solid organic growth. For EBITDA, organic growth between 5% to 6%. More than €350 million of efficiency gains.

More than €400 million cumulated synergies at the end of 2024. Current net income above €1.5 billion, which means a double-digit growth compared to 2023. Leverage ratio below 3x. And as usual, our dividend will grow in line with our current EPS. Thank you for your attention.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you, Claude. And now we are ready to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arthur Sitbon from Morgan Stanley.

Arthur Sitbon

So the first one would be on the synergies and cost savings. I see that the synergies in Q1 are quite strong compared to what you expect for the full year. So I was wondering if we should expect a normalization there in the next 3 quarters or if it's just that potentially you're going to deliver strong synergies on the year.

And on pretty much the same topic, on cost savings, the retention rate as well seems higher than usual, close to 45%. Was there anything unusual happening in Q1? Or is it what we can expect for the whole year? So that's the first question.

The second one is that you talk -- while it's been several months now that you talk a lot about your booster activities and your stronghold activities. I was wondering if there is any action that you may consider to accelerate the shift of your business profile towards more booster activities and a bit less stronghold to potentially accelerate the overall group growth profile of Veolia.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Two very different questions, but in a way, they very much summarize 2 of the 3 levers of our value creation, be it growth and efficiency and delivery on that.

So starting with synergies and cost savings. So yes, we've over-delivered in the first quarter. As usual, we will go on as fast as we can in delivering the synergies. Our commitment remains to deliver €500 million in 4 years. So at least €400 million by the end of this year. And we'll do it as quick as we can.

And I guess in terms of behind figures what is there, there are quite different things throughout the various years. The first year was very much the HQ type of savings. Typically, I don't know, real estate has emerged and 2 HQs in the same city in one same building. Then we moved to, say, more operational things. Typically, I don't know, in Australia, rebooting of trucks.

As you know, in Australia, we had like to 2 kind of similar in size activities in Waste, both in Suez and Veolia, which we've combined and so it's very operational. And I guess now we can see the benefits of the merger within the Water Tech zone, which was slightly delayed compared to, say, the Australia example and which I anticipate to go on for the next quarter. So no slowing down to anticipate in terms of the overall €500 million over 4 years, which we'll deliver as quick as we can.

And I guess, as you know, I'm kind of repeating myself on that one. I like to deliver on our promise and this is my priority as time goes. And in those days of uncertainties in the world, I think to be able to stick to the plan is something which has some merit.

In terms of cost savings, apart from synergies, who are traditional, shall I say, because it's become traditional to have cost savings, €300 million, which we've already enhanced from €200 million or €250 million, which was the initial type of figures to now €350 million per year.

I'm very happy that on top of the traditional cost-savings plans we have throughout all the business units of Veolia throughout the world, we are adding specific ones depending on the specific situation. And typically, I've highlighted briefly in my introduction words the France-specific action plan. France hasn't been -- I mean has been all right, but not great last year. And that's why we've launched a specific action plan, which is starting to bear fruit. Same applies with what I mentioned on exiting some underperforming contracts like the one in Canada.

So I guess, we're trying to be as agile as we can and we have been. And I guess, the next few years will be probably more of the same, plus, say, GenAI, typically, to fuel new ideas. And I tend to say kind of forever in Veolia, we always find new sources of efficiencies.

In terms of your second question on growth, we've announced our strategic plan a few weeks ago. And I guess your question is very much aligned with the strategic direction I've highlighted a few weeks ago, which is booster and stronghold, both are important.

In terms of stronghold, they account for roughly 70% of our revenue, the booster 30%. But in terms of investments, it will be the opposite way around and we expect the growth to come 70% from the boosters and only 30% from the stronghold. So I guess we put our money where our mouth is. And we already make a priority of those boosters, which doesn't mean that we forget the stronghold. And they are very important as well.

Why is that so? They are kind of the foundations on which we anchor, we build the boosters. If I give one example, without our, I would say, classical historic activities of dry waste and municipal water, we wouldn't be able to deliver the bioenergy production from waste or from wastewater, just to give one example, which is a booster. So the two are really intertwined very much.

And I guess when from the stronghold activities, the idea is to maintain our customer happy and to follow some growth. But say, it would be typically inflation plus 1%, what we expect from those type of activities. For the boosters, we're talking 5% to 10% or mid- to high single-digit growth, as we said. And I'm very happy that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter where our boosters have grown like exactly in this range and well above the average of the group in the first quarter. That's for the activities.

And for the geographies, the same applies. We said we are very happy with our history and geography, so France and Europe typically. But we will have a higher rate of growth in the U.S., in the Middle East and Australia and that's exactly what we've seen in the first quarter. Claude mentioned the Australian growth, the American one as well. And each of those 3 geographic boosters have grown by above 6%, and as we've seen in Water Tech, it's even 15%.

So I guess, the priorities are translating into figures now and will be in the next few years. But I guess -- no, I was about to summarize in one more because my answer was very long. I guess it's resilience and growth, which we are aiming at delivering. Resilience comes from the strongholds. The growth comes from the boosters mainly, although you have a little bit of both in both activities, which means that when you say that a company like Veolia, which is long-term contracted activities, infrastructure-like in many ways, is able to deliver in the first quarter 3.9% in of revenue growth, I'm very happy about these results. And it's very, very much a testimony to your question about how to enhance growth. I think the figures demonstrate that.

Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Patel from Goldman Sachs.

Ajay Patel

Thank you very much for the presentation. I think my first sort of set of questions is on this teaser slide, on Slide 19, $200 billion estimated market. I don't think I, when I look at that, have the full appreciation of how Veolia's placed. I know that you have the range of technologies, but if you were to try to cater to that market, what will it take in regards to CapEx investment? What do you have already on the ground that can help to that solution?

And what potentially could you invest to take advantage of this opportunity? Just helping me sort of translate the big sort of number that you presented to actually nuts and bolts, somewhat sort of lower down.

And then I guess the second one is more granular, but just -- with an awful amount of wet weather, I just wondered potentially what could that mean in terms of the impact on water usage? Any sort of commentary around that would be helpful.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Sorry, I haven't understood your second question well enough.

Water usage. Okay, sorry, due to PFAS, you mean, or is it a totally separate question?

Ajay Patel

Sorry, separate question. The second one is separate, but just the first one, give us more on this PFAS. Does it sound like a massive opportunity? It's just it doesn't feel -- it doesn't -- I can't really frame it in my mind in regards to Veolia, yes.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Okay. Good. So two different questions on PFAS, which is the Page 19 you were referring to. I guess a few things on that one. This is about anticipation, positioning, patents and technologies and let me explain why.

PFAS, as you know, is quite an emerging market. That's why the numbers I've mentioned are publicized by third parties. As you know, they are our first estimate. But as I said, the legislation in the U.S. dates back from 3 weeks ago or something like that and it's still evolving and in Europe it's the same.

So it's difficult to assess with and to answer very, very precisely to your question. But there is a unique potential market, which we know will be very, very sizable. What we know as well is it's going to take a little bit of time because legislation translates into projects and then into delivery and then into margin for Veolia. So a little bit of it will see in this GreenUp plan and probably much more in the one after, given some of the time to deliver on those.

But the new opportunity is huge and we are uniquely positioned, that's for certain. How is that so? I detailed that in our deep dive in the U.S. a few weeks ago. So if you want to know more, I encourage you to watch the replay. But in a nutshell, PFAS, say, you can find it in many places in water as well as in soil and sites that you have to decontaminate.

So typically, if you see a map of the world, a map of the U.S. we've shown, a map of Europe, you see PFAS pretty much everywhere where you have large industrial chemical parks as well as every single airport and airbase, basically. And you can see a map where you have PFAS.

How do you treat those? You have usually to concentrate and this is with membranes or resins. It happens that we are #1 in those technologies with Water Tech business. Then you have to, say, treat as in -- I was about to say destroy and cut into pieces. And this is with our high-temperature incinerator, which typically can do that.

High-temperature incinerator, meaning 150 degrees Celsius, just to give you an idea what I mean by high temperature, which our Hazardous Waste business.

So in a way, this is an example where we have the municipal water activity, the Water Technologies like in resins and membranes as well as the Hazardous Waste business, and we are the leaders in every single of those three businesses, actually #1 in each of the three actually in the world and in the various geographies I've just mentioned.

So in a way, we have competitors, of course, in each of those segments. I really believe in each of those segments we are the best. But what's very unique is our ability to offer the full range, the end-to-end solution. And I cannot see anyone offering the end-to-end solution.

And why is it so important? It means that for customers, you would need resin, in another one you would need membrane, for the third one you have go directly to a high-temperature incinerator or whatever because every single situation is different if you talk about an airport pollution, if you talk about a refinery or if you talk about water. So this is really an example of an ecology of solutions, which is, Mr. Customer, you have a problem. We manage to design a solution to fit your needs and we have the full portfolio from end-to-end again.

So difficult to assess how speed -- how quick, I guess, this market will translate into our figures because, again, the legislation is very, very recent. But given what I said, we know which we have a unique opportunity here to offer what we do very well and what we're the leader of.

We already have some contracts we signed because some customers have anticipated the legislation in a way. So it's typically the Department of Defense in Australia or some specific customers in the U.S. and it even started in Europe, so we have already had a few contracts. They are not significant in numbers as in we're talking millions of euros or dozens of millions, no more, so far. But it's moving super, super quick.

On the second question, which is the water usage. If your question is about billing between weather and water usage, I would like to try and understand better your question to be able to answer more precisely if you can. Was that restriction of water -- water restriction you mean or water quality? Or tell me.

Ajay Patel

I was just thinking the weather seems to have been quite wet. And to what extent could that impact your Waste volumes in the second half of the year or over the remaining quarters so that it could be a benefit to you?

Estelle Brachlianoff

I guess the Waste volume, you probably mean the Water volume?

Yes, yes. Just -- Okay. So you always have a little bit of weather impact in Veolia. That's why we have shown you on the various bridge that Claude has what we call the interesting growth, which is the self-help, if you want, from growing our activities and efficiency. And we've had a negative weather effect in the winter, so we may have a positive or negative weather in the summer. I can tell you that whatever is the summer like, I commit on delivering on the guidance I repeated. So that's the usual one.

Second -- so that's the short-term answer. So we can confirm the guidance, whatever. The second answer is on the, I guess, midterm trends. It's fair to say that the summary of '22 in France, the summer of '23 in the U.K. and I could go on like that and in Spain and so on and so forth means that it was such a shocker for municipalities and populations and industries alike that even when it rains, the push for solutions, be the reduction of [indiscernible] or reuse of wastewater and all the rest of it is still very much top of the list of our customers.

So it's good news that it has rained, so the underground water are now a bit more full than they were a few weeks ago. But I can tell you, our customers are still very, very, very adamant to find solution because everybody has perfectly understood that this type of event is here to stay and even to reinforce because it's the first consequence of global warming, basically.

A testimony to that is the survey we've conducted with Elabe in 24 countries with 26,000 people in the world, which we've just released the results a few weeks ago, where the population -- everyone in the world basically has understood that we need solution as in now. And I can tell you whatever the weather is like, this is here to stay.

So we are on a megatrend, which I'm very confident is here to stay because it's pushed the demand from the population itself.

Our next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery from Deutsche Bank.

Olly Jeffery

So a couple of questions. First one, I'd just like to think about how you're seeing the rest of the year in terms of the outlook for Waste growth in China and Europe, given the economic picture is looking slightly better for those regions. So are you seeing any evidence of that yet because I know that in China, obviously, it's been slightly depressed for your business there.

And the other question I have was around just the specifics within the DNA. So industrial capital gains and net provisions are up €31 million versus €10 million last year. Can you just explain what's driving that, please?

And my last question is for the full year is €100 million FX headwind at the EBITDA level still the right order of magnitude? Or have things improved a little bit with the movement in the Chilean peso recently?

Estelle Brachlianoff

Sorry, I don't think I heard well the third question. Okay. EBITDA to EBIT, okay, sorry.

On the first one, the rest of the year. So we see no change in the Waste activities. So the Waste activities, as you can see, has been well performing in the start of the year, plus 5.5% in terms of revenue. And in April, we have the same -- and the start of the May, we have the same trend as in Q1. So we are starting the year very well on the Waste activity.

And so far, so good. The current trending is the same as we speak, as what we have seen in Q1. And for China, this is one of your question. We had -- the China solid waste was better than the start of the year, especially on plastic recycling. So we had a slightly better momentum in China.

In terms of quality of earnings, if this is your question, and the EBITDA to EBIT transmission. As I said in Q1, we have slightly more amortization than last year with the ramp-up of the Tashkent contract, so a little bit more depreciation and amortization.

On the provision side, the main topic was a provision that we had to take last year to cover the risk for a contract ending for around €20 million, and we had no such risk to cover in Q1 2024, which is good news. And on the other side, for the JVs, we had a positive one-off in 2023 and no such thing in 2024.

So if you look at EBITDA, EBITDA has increased by €50 million. And it translates directly into EBIT level at €55 million, so the same amount if you compare to the EBITDA evolution and the EBIT evolution.

Estelle Brachlianoff

And just to complement Claude's answer on the first question. As we've said, we are 85%, we think something like that, immune to macro, which means that, in a way, I would differentiate a little bit Veolia's result from the GDP results and how the economy is going to countries you mentioned. In a way, I can comment on China GDP, but I'd rather comment on Veolia growth in Europe or in China, which were your two questions. And again, we are -- we have some very limited impact of the GDP, say, the 15%. But more interestingly, there is a part of it which is more commerce.

And it's fair to say in some geographies, it's difficult for us to distinguish. Say, the Waste volume is a little bit up in the first quarter as you've seen by 1-point-something percent, 1.2%. And part of it is probably the economy doing a little bit better, and part of it is us being better than the competition.

How do I split both? You know what? It's very difficult to say. And we've seen in some geographies, our competitors complaining and us being relatively happy because our job is to try, and again, like win valuable business and not only just to follow what the economy tells us. China being a good example, we've put a specific action plan in place. So we are not waiting for the rebound of the industry in China. We've put some action plan in place.

So EBITDA is on the up, although revenue is not. I mean, it's kind of flat minus, something like that. But we have the EBITDA on the up because again I would distinguish the macro picture and whether Veolia delivers from it.

Olly Jeffery

That's clear. And just following up on the last question on the FX impact. I think before, you've spoken about €100 million for the full year at the EBITDA level. Is that still the right level to think about? And what should we think about the net income line because obviously a lot of that comes out through minorities. It might be helpful just to clarify on that bit, too.

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So for ForEx impact, we said between €70 million and €80 million if the currency stays at the same level, Olly. And the impact that net income will be super small. So whatever the ForEx, we can fully confirm that the net income will be above €1.5 billion at year-end.

Our next question comes from the line of Jenny Ping from Citi.

Jenny Ping

I've got two questions, please. Just firstly, just going back to the PFAS point, can I ask what is the EPA regulation in terms of the removal rate because my understanding is that it's quite difficult for total removal of any PFAS substances in the water.

And then secondly, linked to that, if I can also ask whether you guys have your own proprietary technology, i.e., competitive edge for the removal process, that would be great.

And then just alongside of that, if I can ask for a bit more color around the recyclate prices and commodities movements that you've seen recently. Normally, you have the chart in the back of your pack, which shows the movements in commodity prices and recyclates, but I don't think it's there. So if you can give some commentary around that would be great.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you. So on PFAS, I would -- again, sorry, I encourage you to have a look at our replay on the U.S. deep dive, which will explain the whole detail of the EPA legislation, which had been released a few days before we've done this deep dive.

I won't go into very much detail. We had two different sets of legislation so far, I mean, if I call EPA legislation, it's more standard than legislation, as such. The first one was on potable water and the second one was more on polluted soil and such, if you want, called [indiscernible]. And in both cases, you're right, it's very difficult to talk about total renewable.

So there is a list of specific PFAS because, as you know, PFAS is a family of products, some of them being very likely [indiscernible] some of them very, very likely not. And it's not for me to decide. It's the sanitary and health authorities which decide that. And It has translated into a specific list of a few PFAS, where the combined pollution level, if you want, has to be detected below a certain threshold.

And I guess, so just to give you a metaphor. The threshold is very small, but it's not 0 because, as you said, the total renewable is difficult. But it's so small, it's the equivalent of the size of a sugar cube in the middle of an Olympic swimming pool, just to give you the idea of the type of threshold the legislation has said will be -- have to be implemented in the next 5 years.

Do we have our own technology? Yes, we do and they are patented. Again, resin, patented; membrane, patented; and very unique as well set of technologies in the high-temperature incinerator, which are above 1,100 degrees, as I mentioned. So yes, it's patented technologies and quite unique. And as you know, in those three, we are #1 player in the world, #1 player in Water Tech in the U.S.

As well and #2 in the Hazardous Waste, so just to mention the U.S. And same applies with Europe, we are #1 in Water Tech and #1 in Hazardous Waste in Europe just the same. So yes, we have our own technologies to treat those. But as I mentioned earlier on, it's not only our technology, it's a set of technologies and the broadness of the end-to-end solution, combining the Water Tech, the Hazardous Waste, which makes us very unique. In terms of recyclate price and commodities, Claude, do you want to comment?

Claude Laruelle

So recyclate, the main topic for us is the paper and cardboard. What we are seeing in the -- you know it has dropped a lot, as I said, in the second part of 2022. After, we have seen a low price since -- during the course of 2023. We have seen a slightly up movement in Q1, especially in the month of March, which is really encouraging for the rest of the year. So we see a movement up in recyclates as we speak.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So it's -- but it's a limited one. So I guess our job is to deliver the result irrespective of the commodities price in a way, be it recyclates or be it energy, as I mentioned in my introduction speech.

And the plastic price is, I guess, average low. So I guess do we have a potential for improvement in the next few years? Yes, we do. The price released still relatively low as we speak. When is it going to happen?

I won't make any bet on that because it's always difficult to predict any commodities, but our commitment is on delivering on our guidance.

We have our next question coming from the line of Alexandre Roncier from Bank of America.

Alexandre Roncier

I've got two, please. The first one is just a follow-up on the EBITDA to EBIT bridge. I think in your press release, you mentioned capital gains. So that was just to confirm the size of them, and if anything material was coming out of Sade for the quarter?

And then the second one is I was looking at your free cash flow, and obviously, there's some phasing quarter-over-quarter and within the year. But I think you mentioned in your press release again some disbursement from carbon. And I was just wondering really the movements there, given that carbon prices are quite much lower year-over-year. And I would have expected perhaps lower by given the mild winter in your district heating business.

So maybe if you can talk about the different driving forces there or if you were maybe a bit more tactical as other industrial players have been, I think, within the market for carbon buying.

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So on the capital gain that was very minimal because, as you know, on the EBIT level we record only the industrial capital gains, so that was only a few millions. So nothing relevant in terms of capital gains for the EBITDA to EBIT translation.

In terms of free cash flow, in terms of -- and Sade capital gain will be below EBIT and will be released during the H1 results, but it's a positive one, I can confirm.

In terms of free cash flow and the CO2. So it's a matter of calendar. So as I said, it's just a calendar effect. In CO2, as you know, we have a hedging policy, the same hedging policy in terms of CO2 as what we have on energy. Because we don't want to take market risk, so we hedge when we sell the energy in the market, we hedge the CO2 in the meantime.

So we have a CO2 price, which is slightly above the market today, but we are buying CO2 on the market for the years to come and that will be also good news for our Energy business in 2025 and in 2026.

And in terms of payments, it's just, as I said, the calendar effect Q1 versus the end of the year. So no impact on the delivery of free cash flow regarding this calendar effect.

Our next question comes from the line of Juan Rodriguez from Kepler.

Juan Rodriguez

I have two in my side, if I may. The first one is, again, coming back on working capital and this seasonal, but increasing effect. I just want to confirm that you're expecting the end of the year towards normalization and relatively flat?

And the second on this working cap is on the higher CO2 quotas. I want to confirm that it does not include U.K. as there was kind -- has been a recent article signaling a possible cost increase on incinerators in the country. So this is the first one -- kind of 1.2 question.

And the second one is on acquisition. So if you can give us more color on the acquisition price and valuation of Hofmann in Germany and any color as well on the price evaluation of the Uniper CGT assets in Hungary will be helpful.

Claude Laruelle

So I'll start with the working capital. So no topic about the U.K. So it's not a topic at all on the working capital.

And in terms of -- yes, we will reverse the working capital at year-end as usual, Juan. It's -- and we know that we start always with Q1 with a stronger negative working capital and it's always reversed progressively in Q3 and Q4. So no change regarding working capital for Veolia. Estelle...

Estelle Brachlianoff

Yes. On the others, so as you know, the U.K. CO2 for incineration, which was your second question, we're talking 2028, if, so going into the ETS scheme. So nothing to do with neither this year nor the years of the GreenUp plan.

But in anticipation, in a way, we knew it were likely to come. Hence, we've started a few projects to capture CO2 from our incinerator, which is a very specific CO2, as I explained in London, actually following a question I had on that one because it's biogenic CO2, which is in a way that kind of, let's call it, the good CO2 as opposed to the bad CO2, which is a non-biogenic one. So no impact at all to expect.

And by the way, the various costs will be bear-ed eventually by the municipalities in the end, not by Veolia. But we want to help, and therefore, we've launched a few projects. And you can see a press release in the U.K. about CO2 capture and storage and so on and so forth.

In terms of the Uniper and off-line prices, there is a reason why we don't publish the price. And usually, it's because the sellers don't want us to. And I guess you can see that it's usually good news when the sellers doesn't want to publish the price of an acquisition made by Veolia. For us, I mean, good news for us. I guess, I will stay there, but highly value creative.

So I think it's a very good example of, what I call, the third pillar of our value creation, which is, I guess, the optimization of the balance sheet and the portfolio of activities while constantly reviewing the plus and the minuses. And on those two, which are on the acquisition side, quick value creation because it's synergistic in both cases with our existing activities, in one case in Germany recycling; and the other one, flexibility in Hungary, which we do already have activities in Hungary in the same type of things.

So value creation, relatively quick. I would say, a little bit plug and play, if you allow me the metaphor. So quite good illustration of that. So it's going to be value creation relatively quickly.

Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Palliez from CIBC Market Solutions -- sorry, CIC Market Solutions.

Arnaud Palliez

I have just one remaining follow-up question on the changes in scope. Can you give us the impact on full year revenue and margin for the acquisitions of Uniper and Hofmann -- or the deal with Uniper. And a reminder also about Morocco, Lydec, what can be the impact on annual sales and margin? And the same question on the disposal side regarding the Italian water concessions.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So you made a quite a long list on the plus side, Uniper and Hofmann. On the minus side, Italia and maybe the Lydec one. So if I summarize all that is included in our guidance for the year, obviously. And whatever the date I'm going to briefly detail, I guess it won't change our €1.5 billion net result target, I would say, in absolute value irrespective of the scope for the end of the year. I think that's the important bit.

So you have the plus and the minuses compensated. And altogether, of course, we expect all that to create value and be a plus.

Uniper is not closed yet. We're talking about later in the year, probably the autumn, something like that. Hofmann, it will be in the account, I think, it varies, a little bit in Q1 and there will be the rest in Q2 onwards.

Lydec, I guess, no impact on net results because it's very, very, I guess, limiting in terms of net results contribution.

And in terms of Sade, in a way, it has a large impact on revenue, but not on margins because, as I said, we're talking about an EBITDA percentage of roughly around 5%. So it's a good business. And the reason why we've sold it is not the 5%, it's a good performance for a construction type of business. But we're not keen to keep construction businesses, as we've highlighted a few times.

And Italia, it was not consolidated because it was a series of minority shares where we didn't have an operational impact on and that's exactly why we sold. So it's a very different situation and very small.

Claude Laruelle

Very small EBIT impact, nonsignificant. Absolutely nonsignificant at group level. So very happy.

Estelle Brachlianoff

That's why all that -- so yes, so all that will again contribute to the €1.5 billion target at current.

And our last question comes from the line of Philippe Ourpatian from ODDO BHF.

Philippe Ourpatian

Yes. I have two follow-up questions. The first one is concerning ForEx. You confirmed a €70 million, €80 million impact. But just could we have, as it's very difficult and mainly linked to Argentina where the situation is a little bit troubled view from Europe, could you just have a kind of sensitivity about what's going to happen if, let's say, your forecast in terms of Argentinian pesos is not exactly aligned with the figure at the end of the year as you are accounting through inflationary-trained accounting principle.

It means that you are taking, let's say, the last day of the quarter or the full year. And just to have a kind of sensitivity concerning the main LatAm ForEx impact at the EBITDA level, please? That's the first one.

And the second one is in the Slide 30, you mentioned some good retention rate. When I'm taking the €33 million net efficiencies, let's say, and the €88 million on the gross value, it seems that we are always around the 50%. Is this means that we are starting to have a better retention rate in terms of efficiency versus the past? Or is it something specific to Q1?

Claude Laruelle

Okay. So maybe on the first one, the best guess that we can make, Philippe, is to take the actual assumption with the actual exchange rate and have a projection on the full year. Argentinian business is very small and EBITDA is very small, so it will not have additional significant impact when you have the full year with the hyperinflation in December resetting the entire year of ForEx impact. So because it's small, we don't expect this to be at the end of the year material in terms of ForEx impact in Argentina. That's what we see today.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So on the retention rate, which is your second question, it made me realize that I didn't answer on that question already asked a few minutes ago. Yes, you're right, 38 divided by 88 is now 43% than 50%. But nevertheless, it's on the upper part of our range, which we said is always between 30% and 50% depending on the quarters.

So does it mean that we'll stay at this type of range as in 43%? You know, 30% to 50% is traditional for us, so I guess the middle part of the range is a good assumption for me going forward. And the specificity of Q1 was more what I mentioned on the Water Tech, which was really, I guess, volume-based and growth-based rather than, I guess, SG&A, which at times necessitates a bit of cost to be able to extract efficiencies.

So I guess the retention rate depends more on the type of efficiency than anything else. When you're talking SG&A at times, you have a bit to pay to get them extracted. Therefore, the net is a little bit on the lower range.

When you talk about, say, purchasing, it's more on the upper end of the range. And the mix makes it different from quarter to the other. And the upper part of the range is due, again, mainly on the Water Tech efficiency plan in the first quarter.

Philippe Ourpatian

Yet in fact, my question was also linked to the GreenUp strategy. It means that are you forecasting to have a better, maybe, retention rate due to this, let's say, new strategy more -- mainly focused on having additional value, making more complex, let's say, technical contract and so on? That's also part of my question.

Estelle Brachlianoff

So I guess, the way to see the GreenUp objective is €300 million per year plus the second part of the synergies, of course, plus the top line growth, all that fueling EBITDA. So in a way, what is important for me is really the 6% average basically growth of EBITDA, which we've published which is 8% -- sorry, €8 billion EBITDA target for 2027.

I guess this is more the figure because you have pluses and minuses. Of course, if we can retain more in efficiency plan, we will. But we can have weather impact as well as we've seen in this quarter or not great commodities, so I guess you have pluses and minuses. That's why the way to see it is really the target of EBITDA and the target even more so in net results, which is 10% on average over the duration of the plan. I guess that's what the attention is focused on.

And usually at Veolia, when we have a specific things happening, we react with an extra specific plan as we've done particularly in France, which is starting to bear fruit. So I guess, instead of talking about average of retention, I'd rather [indiscernible] on, again, net results over the duration of the plan, which is what we are focusing our attention upon with EPS in line in terms of growth.

Thank you. There seems to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brachlianoff for final closing comments.

Estelle Brachlianoff

Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And again, very good result, which helps me to see 2024 with great confidence and confirm our objective for the year and a very good start of our GreenUp plan. Thank you.

Orbán said the country's electricity demand would increase by 50 percent by 2030 due to the new industries. ""We will have Eastern and Western car plants, technologies and production capacities to store green energy, we will participate in space research and link Hungary to the [international] bloodstream of the most modern information technologies,"" the prime minister said.

In addition, Hungary has ambitions to build the most modern defence industry in Europe, and develop its food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries to a higher level, he said.

Orbán said the government's industrial policies would ensure that the industry was supplied with sufficient energy and a well-trained labour force.

Concerning the Tiszaújváros plant, he said value-added jobs were being created, ""providing a secure, predictable future for 300 people"".

Hungary is in the process of diversifying its energy resources to make itself less dependent on global market trends, Orbán said. Hungary imports gas from Qatar, it will buy green energy from Azerbaijan, increase its solar energy capacities, while the upgrade of the Paks power plant is under way, he added.

A crucial component of the Hungarian government's industrial strategy is to provide incentives to Hungarian businesses entering foreign markets. ""Hungarian industry has grown so big that Hungary is now too small,"" he said.

Currently 12,000 Hungarian companies are active abroad or make products for export, and the government is planning to ""create or subsidise another 5,000"" to achieve a similar status, the prime minister said, adding that a relevant scheme would soon be announced.

The government's industrial strategy ""is a good one"", Orbán said, adding that MOL had an important role. ""Just like MOL, the industrial strategy is ambitious ... but with both feet on the ground,"" he said.

MOL, Orbán said, ""has taken the same path as the Hungarian economy, having a single focus 20 years ago, trading in crude oil; now it is spreading in the region, it has a biogas and diesel plant, it has entered the haulier market and it has become a crucial player in waste management.""

The company's new polyol plant will produce the ""Swiss knife of plastics manufacturing"", good for the automotive industry, furniture production, the construction sector and textile manufacturing, he noted.

The prime minister noted that MOL already had two plants in Tiszaújváros, built with support from Japanese investors, while the new polyol plant had taken over technology from Germany's Thyssenkrupp. ""MOL is Hungary's largest and most successful company ... when they build something ... it is built solid,"" Orbán added.",dailynewshungary.com,news,Daily News Hungary,,0.3019607843137255,453399490,23,https://contentf5.dailynewshungary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/viktor-orban.jpg,eng-9567113

The authorities should please pay the allowances of students abroad promptly

It is disturbing that the stipends of Nigerians studying abroad on scholarship have not been paid in the past 11 months by the federal government. ""Some students in China have not received any stipends since they arrived in April and May 2023. In Russia, students are struggling with the increased cost of living due to sanctions,"" according to their statement referenced by a national newspaper during the week. These are students studying under the federal government's bilateral educational agreement scholarship with partnering countries, a scheme supervised by the Federal Ministry of Education. ""This pattern of delayed payments has persisted for years, diverting our focus from academic pursuits to survival (contemplating our next meal, daily transport, pending payments, medical expenses, and housing.)""

Over the years, unpaid allowances have become a pervasive issue plaguing Nigerian scholars abroad, and impacting badly on their pursuit of academic excellence. These scholars, entrusted with representing their country on the global stage, face numerous challenges when essential allowances, such as tuition and living stipends, remain unpaid. As of today, Nigerian students studying in Morocco, Algeria, China, Russia, Hungary, and other countries, on a federal government scholarship scheme are owed their basic allowances as the culture of delayed payment seems to have taken root.

This delay has also led to dire consequences, especially for those residing in countries like Morocco, where the country doesn't have adequate provisions for school hostels, unlike the other sister BEA countries. This means that stipends are crucial for covering basic expenses such as housing, electricity bills, handouts, internet bills, water bills, transportation, and food. Many of these students are now going through harrowing times for no fault of theirs.

This systemic issue not only undermines the potential of Nigerian scholars but also tarnishes the reputation of Nigerian academia on the international platform. Without financial stability, scholars grapple with stress, distraction, and even potential expulsion due to unpaid fees, hindering their focus on studies and research. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding their financial situation erodes their motivation, leading to a decline in academic performance and diminishing the quality of their research output.

For the Nigerian scholars in Russia, the situation is worse given the level of hardship facing the people as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine. There were reports that some of the students had to settle for menial jobs to survive. According to the spokesperson for the parents' group, Kola Benson, since last June, when the students received their last payment, they have not been paid with most of the parents having to beg relatives to send financial support to their wards.

Curiously, a government that seems to have imbibed a culture of delay in the payment of the allowances for the existing scholars has not deemed it fit to suspend the enrolment of new scholars as it selected a new set numbering 179 to study in various institutions in Russia under the Bilateral Education Agreement (BEA) last November. President Bola Tinubu should wade into this crisis and save the innocent children from avoidable embarrassments in foreign lands. All obstacles to prompt payment of these allowances should be tackled immediately.

To renew the hope of Nigerian scholars, the government should implement transparent budget allocation by ensuring sufficient funds are allocated in the federal budget specifically designated for the payment of Nigerian scholars abroad. The government should also establish an effective monitoring mechanism to track the disbursement of allowances from the federal government to relevant agencies. Again, there is a need to streamline administrative processes involved in disbursing allowances to scholars abroad and improve communication channels between the government, relevant agencies, and scholars abroad.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,0.03529411764705892,453395956,1,,

Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are developing a green energy plan to link their power grids with an eye towards exporting electricity to the European Union.

The energy ministers of the three countries announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding in early May to explore their joint electricity export potential by harnessing mainly wind and solar power. Kazakhstan is also aiming to boost its hydropower generating capacity. In outlining cooperation plans, the tripartite memo envisions the laying of a ""high-voltage cable"" on the Caspian Sea's seabed. Technical specifications for such a transmission line have already been developed, according to Kazakh Energy Minister Almassadam Satkaliyev.

""A proposed business model will be developed for the development of international transmission corridors (financing, revenue flow and ownership) and for the sale of green energy to the countries of the European Union,"" a ministry statement quoted Satkaliyev as saying.

The three countries have wasted little time in pursuing the plan. Satkaliiev said May 10 that a feasibility study was underway. He told journalists that the EU had given the budding consortium an expression of ""interest in purchasing clean electricity."" The feasibility study will work out construction and financing details and is expected to produce preliminary estimates by the end of the year. It is too early to put a price tag on the project, or the amount of power exports involved.

""We are talking about a fairly large amount of investment,"" Satkaliyev said.

The effort to foster trans-Caspian connectivity inherent in the tripartite memorandum dovetails with an economic blueprint proposed by the United States, dubbed the B5+1, under which Central Asian states take the initiative in breaking down regional trade barriers and forging new networks to boost trade and investment. Since the B5+1's inception in March, Central Asian states have taken steps to simplify trade rules. The tripartite memo marks a significant step in promoting regional cooperation extending beyond Central Asia to span the Caspian Sea.

The goal of exporting electricity to the EU fits in with plans unveiled by all three countries to significantly expand renewable energy generating capacity in the coming years.

The chief catalyst for power exports is Uzbekistan, which aims to generate an additional 20 Gigawatts (GW) via renewable sources by 2030. Meeting that target would raise the country's total renewable capacity to 27 GW. By April, the government had signed deals to develop wind and solar facilities projected to produce 12 GWs. In May, Uzbekistan entered into contracts for another 6 GW.

""Increasing the efficiency of the energy industry is relevant for our entire region,"" Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said during a Tashkent investor's forum in early May.

Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan seem destined to play more of a facilitating role in the power export arrangement. Given its abundance of fossil fuels, Astana's renewable goals seem more modest than Uzbekistan's. Kazakhstan currently generates about 2.9 GW of power via renewable sources, and hopes to add at least another 5 GW by 2030, according to Satkaliyev. Much of that capacity may be needed at home, however, as Kazakhstan grapples with a power deficit that saw the country become a net importer of electricity in 2023.

Azerbaijan has a target of generating 5 GW of solar and wind power by 2030. The MoU Baku entered into with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan potentially builds on a 2023 agreement that Azerbaijan concluded with EU states, including Hungary and Romania, to export power via an underwater cable traversing the Black Sea with a capacity of 1,000 Megawatts. The feasibility study for the Black Sea project was conducted prior to Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022, thus raising questions about its viability under wartime conditions.",eurasianet.org,news,Eurasianet,,0.3019607843137255,453395544,13,"https://eurasianet.org/sites/default/files/styles/article/public/2024-05/6b018fa17753e5ef58af3448548a7422_1280x720.jpg?itok=F5hw3JVV,https://eurasianet.org/og-twitter.png",

Bigger events are looming only three months later: the national election that might put the far-right in charge of the Alpine country.

In less than a month Austria chooses 20 EU lawmakers to represent it in Brussels and Strasbourg.

Despite the speeches about the importance of the EU, Austrian candidates are boilerplate backbenchers - unlike neighbouring Germany, where talk-show clashes between local political firebrands and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are looming large, while in France, EU election clashes happen daily.

But Austrian party slates feature political has-beens, like centre-right Österreichische Volkspartei's (ÖVP) Reinhold Lopatka - who last held a relevant position in 2017 - or the eternal far-right Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (FPÖ) networker Harald Vilimsky - who after 10 years in parliament, looks to continue his pet project of uniting the German-speaking far-right with those in Italy and Hungary.

The centre-left Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs (SPÖ) put forward Andreas Schieder - who remains an unknown after leading the party to a massive defeat in the 2019 EU elections.

Like the candidates, the political slogans stem from a lack of motivation. Lopatka promises 'Europe. But better' while the Greens say 'Europe needs heart'.

The FPÖ appears to churn out posters at the same rate as all the other parties combined putting some zing into their campaign, with a particularly tasteless image of von der Leyen kissing Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenksyy, linking them to ""Eco-Communism"" and ""warmongering"":

The European Election is, in fact, a rehearsal for the real thing: Just three months later, sometime in September, the country's biggest parliamentary election of the decade will take place. Politicians will face the music in the form of the bill for COVID-19-related spending and the inflation that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

When citizens head to the polls to elect a new national parliament, they will unseat the longest-sitting lawmakers in the country's democratic history - after terms were extended to five years in 2007, no single government lasted this long, and it is only the second government to even make it this far.

The political cards aren't just being reshuffled - the whole table will be flipped.

2019 saw the liberal-conservative ÖVP - led by now-disgraced Sebastian Kurz - winning over a third of the vote. But today, reaching more than a fifth of the votes may be seen as a great result.

The Greens, who quadrupled their vote share to 13% in 2019, are now struggling to surpass 10%.

Meanwhile, the erstwhile biggest opposition party, the SPÖ, is floundering at about 20%, plagued by infighting and the missteps of the newly crowned far-left leader, the small-town Mayor Andreas Babler.

While initially touted as a revivalist of the well-trodden centre-left, Babler has failed to stand out politically and personally, spurning elites in favour of appealing to an undefined ""our people.""

In the other corner, the FPÖ -- with fresh support from anti-vaxxers and those partial to Russia -- is at 30%, doubling its 2019 result to become the most dominant party. This would give the far-right to claim at least the post of parliament president, with its vast procedural powers.

And Herbert Kickl, the far-right firebrand and self-styled ""People's Chancellor,"" may well become chancellor, the head of the Austrian government, a first in the country's post-war history.

When Austria first welcomed the FPÖ, then led by Jörg Haider, into government in 2000, the EU was shocked and considered sanctioning the country. Few expect that external pressures will prevail this time around.

June will show whether the FPÖ can transform polling into poll results and whether one shock election will be enough to calm the population's anger.

Until then, other political parties get to rouse their campaigners, rehearse their canvassing pitches, work on their design skills, and start training for the hot phase of the election - Kickl already did a cross-country test run last year, other politicians may well struggle to match him.

The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission.

Cabinet appoints new acting CEO for Ukrspyrt. On May 3, Stanislav Banchuk was appointed to the position. On May 6, Ukrspyrt confirmed Banchuk's appointment, with no further details.

Banchuk previously had a legal practice in Kyiv. A person by that name was deputy regional prosecutor of Chernivtsi Oblast until 2014 according to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP).

According to YouControl, Banchuk founded Standart Law Firm LLC, Gaztekhkom LLC, Novitni Energetychni Systemy LLC, P.E.G.O. Trading House, Voga Resources LLC, and SpetsOil LLC, which specialize in oil and gas trading.

On March 1, Vitaliy Koval, head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU), wrote that the privatization of distilleries was in the home stretch, with the fund planning to privatize 17 more Ukrspyrt facilities in 2024.

According to Koval, the SPFU had run 115 online auctions of Ukrspyrt assets and 54 auctions had resulted in sales. The sum of prices went from Hr 1.25 billion ($31.5 million) to Hr 3.01 billion ($75.9 million) during the auctions.

As we wrote in January 2022 in Issue 63, acting CEO of Ukrspyrt Serhiy Bleskun resigned. After that, the Cabinet of Ministers temporarily assigned Vitaliy Zhadobin as the new acting CEO.

On Nov. 11, 2022, the Cabinet appointed Ivan Kucherenko as Ukrspyrt's new acting CEO.

Ukrspyrt last had a permanent CEO in 2014, and the company has since been led by various ""acting"" CEOs.

Detention order issued for SPFU's former head who allegedly embezzled millions. On May 8, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) ordered detention for the former head of the SPFU, Dmytro Sennychenko, who is wanted internationally.

According to the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), Sennychenko headed a criminal group that embezzled more than Hr 500 million ($12.6 million) from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC), and laundered Hr 10 billion ($252 million) in 2019-2021.

As we reported in Issue 80, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and SAPO said that they exposed a criminal group run by Sennychenko in March 2023. See Issue 80 for more detail.

Sennychenko headed the SPFU from September 2019 to February 2022. He filed his resignation letter in November 2021, but the Verkhovna Rada only approved his resignation on Feb. 17, 2022.

As we wrote in Issue 83, the suspects in this case, including Sennychenko, were placed on the wanted list in April 2023.

In November 2023, we wrote that NABU and SAPO updated suspicions against all members of the criminal group allegedly led by Sennychenko. They are now also suspected of legalizing criminal proceeds of over Hr 10 billion ($252 million).

See our Issues 80, 83, and 114 for more detail on this case.

Ukrainian energy facilities struck again. On May 8, the Energy Ministry reported that Russia damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including transmission facilities in Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Vinnytsia oblasts.

There were no casualties or injuries. Power engineers worked together with the State Emergency Service to eliminate the consequences, the ministry added.

In addition to damage to generation infrastructure, equipment at one of Ukrenergo's facilities in central Ukraine was also damaged, the company said.

Due to the power shortages caused by the massive attack, Ukrenergo was forced to impose restrictions on power supply to industry and businesses during evening peak hours.

Ukrenergo also imports electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova, but according to the company's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, this is not enough to cover the deficit.

Rinat Akhmetov's DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy holding, reported that Russia attacked three of its thermal power plants again, severely damaging equipment.

On May 9, Ukrhydroenergo reported that two hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) were out of operation due to the attack. [The company has a total of ten HPPs.

""Today, all hydroelectric power generation has suffered crucial damages. The destroyed equipment requires considerable efforts to repair and restore and significant financial resources,"" the company said.

On June 6, Ukrhydroenergo reported that the Kakhovka HPP was destroyed beyond restoration after the Russians set off a massive explosion in the engine room. See our Issue 91 for more detail.

Russian missiles attacked Ukraine's largest HPP, the Dnipro HPP in Zaporizhzhia, on March 22. See Issue 124 for more detail.

During another missile attack, on March 29, the Kaniv and Dniester HPPs were deliberately targeted by Russian forces. See Issue 125 for more detail.

After every Russian mass missile attack on Ukraine's vital infrastructure, emergency outages take place, lasting for days due to the ongoing repair works. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks.

Ukraine faced the largest Russian missile and drone attack on its energy facilities on March 22. See Issue 124 for more detail.

A week later, Ukrenergo faced yet another Russian missile and drone attack. See more in Issue 125.

On April 11, Ukraine faced the third Russian attack on its energy facilities in one month. The Trypillia Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in Kyiv oblast was destroyed. See Issue 127 for detail.

On April 27, Ukraine faced another Russian attack on its energy infrastructure. See Issue 129 for more.

The Cabinet keeps low electricity tariffs for households until the end of May 2024. On April 26, the Cabinet of Ministers extended public service obligations (PSOs) for another month, from April 30 - May 31. The price for households will remain Hr 2.64 ($0.07) per kWh.

Energoatom and Ukrhydroenergo were granted the right to sell electricity on market terms from Oct. 1, 2021. Under the new PSO model, the proceeds were used to compensate electricity providers for the difference between the regulated household tariffs (at that time, Hr 1.44/kWh and Hr 1.68/kWh depending on the volume of consumption) and market prices.

Since October 2021, the Cabinet of Ministers has repeatedly extended the PSO mechanism to keep electricity tariffs for households unchanged until the end of the previous heating season. The PSO mechanism was in place until April 30, 2023.

On May 30, 2023, the Cabinet approved an increase in the electricity tariff for households to Hr 2.64/kWh from June 1, 2023.

As we reported in Issue 115, in January, the PSO model had been extended until April 30. The government made this decision to reduce the financial burden on households due to the difficult economic situation caused by the full-scale war. As a result, the electricity price for households would continue to be Hr 2.64 per kWh.

According to Deputy Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the possibility of raising electricity tariffs, as resources are needed for the next heating season. No decision has been made yet, she said.

As we reported in our earlier issues, the low electricity tariff has consistently caused financial challenges for Ukrainian energy SOEs:

As we wrote in April, Naftogaz left the current gas tariff for households unchanged for at least another year. See Issue 129 for detail.

Ukrenergo reports a Hr 400 million profit in 2023 (audited); financial statements on the LSE website. On May 3, Ukrenergo reported its financial results for 2023, ending the year with a revenue of Hr 83 billion ($2.1 billion).

The company's financial statements, including the independent auditor's report, were published on the website of the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

On May 10, the company also held a briefing where CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi commented on Ukrenergo's key indicators in 2023.

The company made a profit of Hr 377 million ($9.5 million) in 2023. In 2022, Ukrenergo posted a loss of Hr 6 billion ($151 million)

Despite the Russian shelling of the infrastructure and the difficult situation in the energy system, the value of Ukrenergo's assets increased by almost Hr 45 billion ($1.1 billion), Kudrytskyi said.

In addition, the company paid Hr 2.4 billion ($60 million) in taxes and dividends to the state in 2023.

Kudrytskyi also said that the company paid off Hr 24 billion ($605 million) in debts in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.

As we wrote in November 2023, the electricity market had a chain of debts of ""everyone to everyone"" worth Hr 60 billion ($1.5 billion). See Issue 110 for more detail.

German government grants 45 million euros ($48.7 million) to restore and protect energy infrastructure. On May 9, Ukrenergo signed an agreement with the German Development Bank KfW.

According to Ukrenergo's CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, this will pay for a high-voltage line that will increase the stability of Ukraine's connection to the European grid. The aid will also pay for high-voltage equipment and restoring facilities in central Ukraine after Russian attacks.

In total, with KfW's support, Ukrenergo has attracted more than 177 million euros ($191 million) in loans and grants for the restoration and development of the electricity transmission network since Russia's invasion, the company added.

As we reported in Issue 128, Ukrenergo received nearly 1 million euros ($1.1 million) worth of energy equipment from German partners.

Naftogaz Group says its 2023 audited net profit is Hr 23 billion; financial statements not yet available. On May 7, Naftogaz Group reported that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($583 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($1.9 billion) loss in 2022.

The company said that its consolidated financial statements were confirmed by an independent auditor, approved by the supervisory board on May 3, and sent to the Cabinet for approval.

The financial statements were not publicly available at the time of writing.

Note that the law on the functioning of the financial sector during martial law allows, in particular, joint-stock companies not to publish financial statements.

In pursuance of this law, the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), as a regulator, adopted a decision according to which joint-stock companies must disclose their annual and interim information (which includes financial statements) for 2021-2023 during 90 days after the end of martial law.

Until this provision of the above law is lifted, state-owned joint-stock companies, such as Naftogaz, Ukrnafta, and others, will have a legal ground not to disclose their financial statements.

Under normal circumstances, according to the NSSMC's disclosure regulation, joint-stock companies must disclose annual financial statements for 2023 as part of their annual disclosure by April 30.

At the same time, the law does not prevent such disclosure (including financial statements) by SOEs, as this would be customarily done in best corporate governance practice.

We are not aware of any objective reasons, including those related to martial law, for the above exemption to continue to exist. The lack of annual reports leads to opaqueness of SOEs, including making it impossible to analyze or understand their performance.

When SOEs or their management report selected financial indicators or trends, no objective analysis of such reports or SOEs' performance altogether is possible.

Countries with developed capital markets have rules regulating the disclosure of sensitive (insider) information by public companies. Among other things, shareholders, other investors, or the public may not be misled by selective or delayed disclosure of such information.

The profitability of the business lines was driven by significantly improved financial results of the Group's companies, Naftogaz added without providing any details.

The company also said that most of the profit will go into dividends to the state. The Cabinet set the individual dividend pay-out ratio for Naftogaz at 95%. See SOE Weekly's Issue 118.

It is also unclear whether or how Ukrnafta's financial performance is incorporated in Naftogaz's financial statements.

As we reported in Issue 121, Ukrnafta is to pay the state a total of Hr 8 billion ($202 million) in dividends for 2023. Ukrnafta's audited financial statements for 2022 or 2023 were also not available at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, the former CEO of the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU) Serhiy Makogon questioned the data. He said that buffer gas was Naftogaz's major source of profit in the first six months of 2023, according to the company's (unaudited) reporting for that period.

Apparently, this means that Naftogaz was now able to sell the buffer gas from underground storages, which it could not sell earlier.

Buffer gas is the volume of gas that is necessary to ensure the stable operation of underground storages, including maintaining the necessary pressure that allows normal gas take-off.

Naftogaz CEO interviewed. Naftogaz CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov spoke to Forbes Ukraine this week. We selected key segments:

On Naftogaz's financial performance in 2023 and forecasts for 2024:

As we reported in Issue 126, Ukrnafta earned almost Hr 24 billion ($605 million) in net profit in 2023.

It is unclear how Ukrnafta's dividends would be paid to the state and Naftogaz; see previous item.

As a result of the attack, the tracks at Kherson railway station were damaged, and the movement of Train No. 121/122 (Kyiv-Kherson-Kyiv) was temporarily restricted. Later that day, railway workers completed repairs to the track damaged by the shelling, the company said.

As we reported earlier, Ukrzaliznytsia's civilian infrastructure in and around Dnipro was also shelled by Russian troops on April 19. See Issue 128 for more detail.

Confiscated PentoPack Plant up for auction at Hr 203 million ($5.1 million), the State Property Fund's (SPFU) press office reported on May 6. It was confiscated from Russian-Greek businessman Ivan Savvidi.

The online auction is scheduled for May 31.

According to the SPFU, PentoPack is one of the leading producers of packaging for meats and sausages. It produces multilayer synthetic shrink wrap using modern technologies, including printing with UV, water, and alcohol inks.

PentoPack's products are used in more than thirty countries around the world. In Ukraine, the company does business with Rud, Globino, and Myasna Gildiya.

PentoPack retained 193 jobs and has no wage or state budget arrears. The company plans to enter new markets for packaging materials for the dairy industry, fish processing, and animal feed packaging, the SPFU added.

""This is an extremely attractive investment asset. It is not just about production facilities, but about a well-established profitable business in a promising segment of the food industry. The new owner would have all the opportunities for further growth and development,"" SPFU head Vitaliy Koval said.

As we reported in Issue 122, the SPFU declared its privatization plans for PentoPack in early March.

Ukrnafta and ARMA seek permission to manage Tatneft's assets. On May 6, Ukrnafta and the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), applied for a merger clearance to manage Russian Tatneft Group's assets in Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts. These include petrol stations, oil depots, and other commercial property - a total of 110 units.

Most of them are in rundown condition, and some petrol stations have been destroyed, and they need to be rebuilt from scratch, Ukrnafta said. As of today, about 15 of the 70 Tatneft petrol stations are operational. The situation is similar with idle oil depots, Ukrnafta added.

ARMA declared its plans to transfer Tatneft filling stations to Ukrnafta's management ten months ago (see Issue 99), and the Cabinet transferred them on Aug. 15, 2023 (see Issue 100).

It is unclear why ARMA and Ukrnafta had not applied for merger clearance earlier, and how the assets have been maintained in the meantime.

Ukrnafta said that it would assess these assets on a case-by-case basis to calculate the required level of investment and the timing of their return.

ARMA and Ukrnafta are finalizing the asset management agreement.

As we reported earlier, Ukrnafta also manages the assets of the Glusco group. On March 14, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine allowed Ukrnafta to take over the management of Glusco's assets - see Issue 123. On March 15, Ukrnafta and ARMA said that they signed acts of acceptance for the transfer of Glusco assets - see Issue 124.

Batteries are broadly classified into two categories, namely primary batteries and secondary batteries. Primary batteries, also known as use-and-throw batteries, can only be charged once and are discarded when completely discharged due to irreversible electrochemical reactions. They are also known as rechargeable batteries. On the other hand, secondary batteries, also known as rechargeable batteries, can be charged and reused for multiple cycles. These batteries are reversible, allowing for the creation of products and electricity when discharging. The flow of electrons into the battery facilitates the reverse reaction, where the products react to form the reactants. Both primary and secondary batteries are essential for various applications.

May 14 (Interfax) - A total of 421 communities across Ukraine were cut off from power supply for various reasons as of the morning of May 14, Ukrainian media have reported with reference to the national power grid operator Ukrenergo's social media post.

Power supply restrictions on industrial consumers will be applied from 4:00 p.m. May 14 to 7:00 a.m. May 15, it said.

""Consumption restriction is an essential measure to maintain stable power system operations,"" Ukrenergo said.

The day before, restrictions were expected to be applied starting from 5:00 p.m.

Consumption in the national energy system is growing as the temperature dropped, Ukrenergo said. In particular, consumption grew 4.5% as of 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday from the same time on Monday, and the consumption peak on Monday evening was 4% higher than that on the previous working day, May 10, it said.

""Considerable electricity shortage persists in the energy system for most of the day,"" Ukrenergo said.

To cover shortage in the power system, emergency power supplies to Ukraine from the Romanian, Polish, and Slovak energy systems were activated at Ukrenergo's request from 0:01 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. and from 10:00 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on May 13. Ukraine also accepted emergency assistance from European Union countries from 0:01 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. on May 14.

On Tuesday, Ukraine is expected to import a total of 21,072 MWh of electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova, with transmission capacity reaching 1,463 MW during certain hours.

Since December 1, 2023, the capacity limit for electricity supplies from the European Union to Ukraine and Moldova has been increased to 1,700 MW.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.02745098039215688,453385264,7,,eng-9567972

He added: ""I will make special mention of something which is not only an economic fact, but also an expression of confidence: the fact that we can extend our cooperation to the whole spectrum of the nuclear industry, where up until now there has been no cooperation between our two countries. This holds great potential, because in this respect - in terms of the nuclear industry - Hungary has considerable international experience and prestige, as we have been involved in this industry for more than 50 years, and currently the largest nuclear development in Europe is taking place in Hungary. Our plan is that by the beginning of the next decade the share of Hungary's energy provided by nuclear power will be between 60 and 70%.""

Hungary's Foreign Affair &Trade Minister Peter Szijjártó said the talks between Xi and Orbán had been ""extremely successful"". He said the two sides expanded an earlier a list of joint projects under the Belt and Road initiative aimed at developing East-West connections. ""We have now agreed with the Chinese government on drafting a cooperation agreement covering the length and breadth of the nuclear industry to ensure both countries' access to the cheapest, safest, most efficient way of producing electricity,"" he noted. Demand for electricity will increase sharply the world over, he said, adding that nuclear energy best met such demand.

Szijjártó said the new all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for the new era was an honour for Hungary. ""I think it reflects the rightfulness of our China policy. We are among those countries in Europe, which consider the cooperation with China as an opportunity and not as a risk,"" he said, adding that Hungary rejects de-risking, decoupling and all kinds of such approaches.",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.2549019607843137,453376462,38,,eng-9565006

Speaking in Belgrade at the Energy Forum, he stressed the importance of responsible energy policies that transcend ideology and hypocrisy, particularly evident in Europe's sanctions against Russia. Highlighting the practicalities of energy infrastructure, Péter Szijjártó noted that reliance on Russian oil has shifted to Indian imports in Europe, while France remains a significant purchaser of Russian natural gas.

Minister Szijjártó emphasized the importance of maintaining national autonomy in energy decision-making, tailored to each country's unique needs. He debunked the notion of environmentalism as a political monopoly, citing Hungary's success in reducing emissions while fostering economic growth.

Identifying nuclear expansion as crucial for meeting rising electricity demands, Mr. Szijjártó cited the Paks Nuclear Power Plant expansion as a collaborative effort involving global stakeholders. He warned against ideological attacks on nuclear energy and advocated for a united front within the European nuclear coalition.

Hungary plans to implement incentive programs during its EU Presidency to boost demand and support global cooperation among automotive companies.

Highlighting Hungary's position as a hub for both Western and Eastern automotive manufacturers, Péter Szijjártó emphasized the significance of Chinese investment in Hungarian electromobility. He dismissed calls for de-risking economic ties, pointing to the EUR 16B of Chinese investment as a testament to Hungary's pragmatic approach to economic partnerships.",hungarytoday.hu,news,Hungary Today,,0.4509803921568627,453375108,10,https://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/energy-g3d2e36473_1920-e1694782524160.jpg,

However, the initiative still has to overcome several energy challenges such as upgrading the outdated infrastructure, ensuring a fair and inclusive transition to a low-carbon economy, harmonizing the legal frameworks among the member states, and meeting the EU's high climate standards. During the political transition, these countries prioritized economic and political reforms over energy challenges. In the 1990s, only the Western countries, thus those outside the Eastern bloc, made significant progress in the energy sector. The production of a unit of GDP in many countries of the Three Seas Initiative has been more costly than in Western Europe. Therefore, these states are striving to align their economic and energy policies with the EU standards.

The Three Seas region is a group of countries that vary in geography, climate, economy, and economic resources. Each of them uses different sources of energy and emits different amounts of greenhouse gases. To show how diverse the Three Seas region is, let us look at some of the countries in this group. Lithuania relies mainly on gas, biofuels, and renewables, and seeks to diversify its energy sources. It has no intention to build nuclear plants shortly, though. Similarly, Estonia's parliament adopted a renewable electricity target of 100 percent by 2030. Contrary to what it may seem, Hungary's energy system has a relatively low carbon intensity. The country relies on coal for only about a dozen or so of its energy mix. State authorities plan to increase their use of renewable energy sources and invest in new nuclear reactors at the Paks power plant. Hungary increased its solar power capacity by nearly 1 gigawatt in 2022. The Czech Republic is also phasing out coal and expanding its nuclear energy sector to secure its energy independence.

The Three Seas countries and other Central and Eastern European nations are undergoing a fast energy transition, driven by the EU's stricter climate policy. Diversifying energy sources became more important after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. As the Kremlin's influence in the region has weakened over the past two years, energy prices have risen, especially for fossil fuels that were once largely imported from the east. One thing is certain: the region is undergoing a transformation that will involve reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

The region has a lot of scope for developing renewable technologies, even though coal and gas have been and still are the main sources of energy for many of its economies. Offshore wind power plants are very feasible for the countries on the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Northern countries like Poland and the Baltic states can invest in both offshore and onshore energy, even though they use different types of energy sources. Conversely, countries like Slovenia, Romania, and Hungary, which are situated in the central-southern region of the Three Seas, are known for their significant potential in producing solar energy. The advancement of renewable energy sources is crucial for the Three Seas Initiative because it can help mitigate the continuous increase in energy costs. In the journey of energy transition, particularly for economies heavily reliant on coal, gas serves as an excellent bridge fuel. This is evident from the investments made by countries in the region, such as the doubling of the LNG terminal capacity in Croatia, the construction of the FSRU terminal near Gdańsk, and the expansion of the Polish LNG terminal's capacity from 5 to 8.3 billion cubic meters annually.

Without a doubt, the year 2030 will be a significant milestone for Europe in terms of both political and climate-related developments. In the political sphere, there is a growing discussion within the EU forum about plans to extend the union by incorporating a country from the Western Balkans. In terms of climate and energy policies, 2030 marks the completion of certain frameworks established by the European Union. Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that within a strict framework, certain countries may struggle to meet their individual objectives. Indeed, if we expand our view beyond just the Three Seas countries, and if the economic and energy development in Central and Eastern Europe continues at its current pace, with transformations that are equitable and customized to each economy, we could anticipate a significant increase in the capacity of wind and solar power plants in this region. The capacity could rise from the current 35 gigawatts to 196 gigawatts by 2030. This increase could potentially reduce energy prices by up to a third and enable the export of up to 20 gigawatts of electricity post-2030. In 2022 alone, the total capacity of solar and wind power plants in Central and Eastern Europe saw an increase of less than 30 percent. This suggests a potential for this trend to continue, further contributing to the region's energy development and transformation.

There is a clear political desire for transformation within the energy sector in the countries involved in the Three Seas Initiative. It is important to note that in the Central and Eastern European region, political support is significantly influenced by energy prices. This, in turn, affects the stance of individual governments towards investments in the energy sector. The Baltic states have set a goal to disconnect their energy systems from the Russian grid by 2025. Following this, they plan to subsequently connect to the continental European grid. Indeed, Latvia and Estonia are also participating in the development of offshore wind farms. Another noteworthy example is the collaboration between Hungary and Romania, along with Azerbaijan and Georgia. They have signed a memorandum to develop an underwater electric cable that will run through the Black Sea. The investment is intended to bolster the export of energy to Europe. Hungary is a country that has significant geothermal potential. As a testament to this, the first geothermal power plant was connected to their national grid in late 2017. An excellent illustration of future collaboration is the proposal by Romania and Bulgaria to construct a shared energy island. For Poland, which has an economy heavily reliant on coal, there have been numerous investments and strategies developed in recent years. The goal of these initiatives is to attain energy independence and ensure a stable supply of natural gas to the Central and Eastern Europe region. Several significant projects stand out, including the Baltic Pipe, the enlargement of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście, the introduction of a new FSRU terminal, the development of nuclear reactors in collaboration with the United States and South Korea, and the implementation of small modular reactors (SMRs).

The success of the energy transition not only relies on top-down decisions but also significantly depends on the collaborative efforts of the private sector, the public sector, and the general public. An excellent illustration of public involvement is the widespread support for the ""My Electricity"" government program in Poland. The initiative aimed to offer a co-funding sum of as much as PLN 5,000 for the setup of solar panel systems in domestic houses. The considerable interest shown by the beneficiaries led to the construction of close to 10 gigawatts of photovoltaic energy between 2020 and 2023.

The partnership within the Three Seas Initiative is consistently progressing and it is undeniably a framework that deserves consideration, especially in the light of the current geopolitical system. Moving forward, the significance of investments in interconnectors cannot be overstated. Such investments will facilitate the delivery of electricity, produced from offshore wind energy at sea, to areas of demand. This calls for, among other initiatives, the deployment of bridging systems and the expansion of cross-border networks to harness the advantages. In addition, the transition of many countries to nuclear energy can benefit others. This is because nuclear power stations in a particular country can have a substantial impact on the regional energy composition, especially through grid interconnections.",warsawinstitute.org,news,Warsaw Institute,,0.3098039215686275,453371692,23,https://warsawinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zrzut-ekranu-2024-05-10-172717.png,eng-9562835

Two IMOCAs are still making their way towards New York. With 800 miles to sail Switzerland's Ollie Heer (Oliver Heer Ocean Racing) has no power except occasional very sporadic supply from his solar panels and Clarisse Crémer (L'Occitaine en Provence) at 1690 miles is making steady progress after leaving the Azores yesterday morning after a five-day technical pit stop.

In seventh place in Class40 young French rising star Amélie Grassi (La Boulangère Bio) will be next to finish later tonight, she tore her mainsail early in the race. She finished not far behind 2004-5 Vendée Globe winner Vincent Riou who finished sixth on his solo Class40 racing debut. After Grassi there are two more skippers on course, as well as the two Vintage classic boats: Patric Isoard's Uship pour Enfants de Mekong, an older Open 50, and Remy Gerin's well known spirit of tradition 65 foot cutter Faïaoahé are also going well.

Not what he came for......

Currently the Class40 class champion Italy's Alberto Bona was among the podium favourites on this race with his Sam Manuard designed 2022 launched Mach40.5 IBSA.

His friend and rival, Ambrogio Beccaria might have taken the Class 40 win, but yesterday 'Bogi' had a grey, drizzly arrival into New York. One of the pre-race favourites Alberto Bona might now be slightly disappointed with his fifth - or more significantly the fact he could not make up ground after initial problems -but for completing what he describes as 'most diffcult race I've done' Albi was blessed with a peach of a morning for his beautiful arrival into the Big Apple. 0600hrs dawn, sunshine, light breeze, blue skies...Manhattan skyline shimmering ...blessed!

On the dock in Brooklyn Bona explained: ""There were a lot of problems, I've never had a lot of problems on this boat but this time I had a lot. Starting with the J1, the J1 was starting to deteriorate ( on the luff, I'm not sure why. With the first reaching on the second day when we started to go fast in the first low pressure. Then there was a problem of losing time because I had a rudder that came up and broke, the line that keeps the rudder down in the fixed position broke and so at thirty five knots at one point I had no rudder in the water and so I was trying to fix that. I lost a lot of time. I then had the J2 tear. I think because they were flapping quite a lot when we were at forty five knots, I had to ease the sails a bit to go fast and then they were flapping a bit and so the sails didn't like it, so I tore the J2. Then after a certain point, on the port side, I heard a strange sound in reaching the second low pressure. It was a new sound for me, the boat was slamming on the water and making a new sound. I realised that something went wrong with a bit of delamination on the hull. We don't know yet if we hit something from the external side and so this is our major issue, working out what happened there.""

Meantime during the small hours of the morning Belgium's Denis Van Weynbergh (D'Ieteren Group) arrived into the ONE 15 marina having completed the course in 24th placed in 12 days 3 hours in the IMOCA class. His result represents the final requirement to ensure the 56 year old former businessman should now take the start of the Vendée Globe on the former Spirit of Hungary which has already completed the Barcelona World Race and one Vendée Globe.

The solo racer was delighted, ""The objective was to validate my qualification for the Vendée Globe. We slammed it into New York. We couldn't have dreamed of better. We've been in this project for six years. It's a great time. My best memory ? Crossing the finish line because it was synonymous with qualification. Afterwards, it's an incredible race The Transat which has made me dream of since I was teenager, with the epic of Tabarly and all the elder statesmen of ocean racing. I always wanted to participate. It's a race that you have to do at least once in your life, maybe not twice. As the queen of the Transats it is tough, you need to be committed. We knew it even if we had conditions that were a little different from usual. We had everything: strong wind downwind, strong wind upwind... That's also what we were looking for. It's huge to get here. It's like doing Roland Garros or the Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix. Arriving here solo is already a victory.""

Down but not out, no way!

Oliver Heer's mood lifted this afternoon as he enjoyed a sustained spell making a modest but workmanlike eight to nine knots towards New York aboard the IMOCA which won this race in 2008. After being knocked down in the middle of the week he has had no electrical power save intermittent supply from a workround using his solar panels through his engine battery. And so he is predominantly hand steering. Extreme fatigue caught up with him yesterday night when he fell asleep for five straight hours, the boat heading in the wrong direction....

Heer reported in: ""I had a bit of a shocker last night, I wanted to go to sleep for 30 minutes last night and ended up sleeping through my alarm for about four hours, the wind changed and I ended up sailing a couple of ours in the wrong direction. I hit a pretty low point. My electronics are completely down, I managed to rig my solar panels into my tiny engine battery and so I do every now and then have electricity to turn on the satcomms to dowloand the GRIB files, but not enough to run the pilot or anything. I've rigged up a rudimentary steering system with some strings around my tiller and around the winches which is pretty good how I can leave it for half an hour or so so that I can get some rest but really I have to have hand drive to make progress. My course of steering now is basically WNW and just trying to get as many miles in the breeze as I can with the breeze over to New York. It's really tough, when I had the knocked down my mainsail got ruined and I've got three battens gone in my mainsail. I'm basically on my J1 or J3 which is not ideal but yes I'm still in it! I'm desperate to make as many miles as I can over to New York and to finish the race before the line closes on the 20th May. I'm still in it!""

Flash info Mast down on Zeiss

Today at 16:20 UTC, while sailing 250 miles east of the finish line in NE'ly winds of 30 knots with 3 to 4 metres of wave, the Class40 Zeiss dismasted.

By the time he left Friday, he had struck deals that provide fertile ground for China's economic expansion plans in Europe.

After meeting with nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbn on Thursday, the leaders spoke to a small group of select media in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to announce the formation of an ironclad partnership that would pave the way for a new era of economic cooperation.

While most EU countries are working to reduce the risks to their economies from perceived threats posed by China, Hungary has moved in the opposite direction, courting significant Chinese investment in the belief that the second largest economy in the world is essential for Europe's future.

Although Xi and Orbn did not reveal concrete agreements after their meeting, Foreign Minister Pter Szijjrt later said in a video that an agreement had been reached on a joint rail bypass between the Hungary and China around Budapest, as well as a high-speed rail connection between Budapest and Budapest. the capital and its international airport.

The two countries also agreed to expand cooperation across the entire spectrum of the nuclear industry, Orbn said, and agreements were reached for China to help Hungary develop its network of vehicle charging stations electricity and on the construction of an oil pipeline between Hungary and Serbia.

Zsuzsanna Vegh, program assistant at the German Marshall Fund and visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the agreements were a clear signal that China views Hungary as a ""key and reliable ally"" in the EU as it seeks to reverse Europe's hardening risk reduction policy.

Xi's visit, Vegh wrote in a statement, shows that the Hungarian government ""remains indifferent to the concerns of its allies and will continue to strengthen its bilateral relations with China in order to position itself favorably in what it perceives as a multipolar world in development.

Pursuing a similar strategy, Hungary's southern neighbor Serbia has also provided ample opportunities for Chinese companies to exploit its natural resources and carry out large infrastructure projects.

Like Orbn, Serbian President Aleksandar Vui has built a form of autocratic governance that eschews the pluralism valued in more traditional Western democracies, making both countries attractive to China because opaque direct agreements help eliminate red tape.

During Xi's visit to Serbia last week, he and Vui signed an agreement to build a common future, making the Balkan country the first in Europe to agree on such a document with Beijing.

Vuk Vuksanovi, a senior researcher at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, said Xi's interest in Serbia reflects his strategy of attracting countries less committed to a U.S.-led economic and political community.

Xi's joint future agreement with Belgrade, Vuksanovi said, promotes China's vision of the international order, one where China is much more powerful, one where Western powers, primarily the United States, have no plus the ability to dictate the agenda to others.

China has invested billions of dollars in Serbia in the form of investments and loans, particularly in the mining and infrastructure sectors. The two countries signed a strategic partnership agreement in 2016 and a free trade agreement last year.

While Serbia officially wants to join the EU27, it is gradually moving away from this path and some of its agreements with China do not comply with membership rules.

Vui is friends with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has condemned Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, but has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow.

The red carpet treatment by Serbia and Hungary has worried some of their Western partners, who see China's incursion into the region as both an economic and security risk. According to Gabriel Escobar, US envoy for the Western Balkans, Xi chose to visit neighboring countries because they ""are willing to challenge the unity of the Euro-Atlantic community.""

""We warn all our partners and all our interlocutors to be very aware of China's agenda in Europe,"" Escobar said last week.

In February, Hungary followed Serbia's lead by reaching a security agreement with Beijing under which Chinese law enforcement officers would be allowed to assist their Hungarian counterparts in police actions in Hungary.

The government said the officers would ensure public safety for Chinese tourists and members of Hungary's large Chinese diaspora. But critics say these officers could be used as an extension of Xi's one-party state to exert control over the Chinese community.

As Orbn deepened relations with Beijing, he also engaged in a protracted conflict with the EU that saw billions in structural funds frozen in Budapest amid fears he would seize democratic institutions and abuses bloc funds.

That money doesn't appear to be coming anytime soon, and Hungary's pursuit of additional Chinese developments shows that its government ""does not consider the possibility of financing such strategic infrastructure projects with European funds,"" Vegh wrote.

While the influx of Chinese capital is a boon for Hungary's struggling economy, having production sites on EU territory also helps Beijing circumvent costly tariffs and increasingly restrictive policies. protectionists of Europe.

In December, Hungary announced that one of the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturers, China's BYD, would open its first European electric vehicle production plant in the south of the country and invited significant direct investment in production batteries for electric vehicles.

Such investments, Orbn said Thursday, are what will keep Hungary competitive in the future, wherever they come from.

The idea that drives Hungarians is that we want to win the 21st century, not lose it, he said.

European production of electric vehicle batteries would dramatically slash carbon emissions compared to manufacturing in China, but the market is set to be remain reliant on Far East imports, according to a new report.

Onshoring the EV supply chain to Europe would cut the emissions of making a battery by 37 per cent compared to a China-controlled supply chain - and as much as 60 per cent when using renewable electricity, says green think tank Transport & Environment.

However, it warns that less than half of EV battery production planned for Europe by 2030 is secure, meaning manufacturers will continue to source parts built primarily in Asia.

A new report claims that European-made EV batteries would dramatically slash carbon emissions compared to China and the Far East. Pictured: inside the VinFast battery factory in Haiphong, Vietnam

By producing Europe's demand for battery cells and components locally would save an estimated 133 metric tonnes of CO2 between 2024 and 2030.

The campaign group said this saving would be equivalent to the total annual emissions of the Czech Republic today.

However, a lack of commitment to the EV transition is said to be extending the period in which car makers are reliant of sourcing components from the Asian market.

That's because only 47 per cent of the lithium-ion battery production plants planned for Europe up to 2030 are secure.

While this is an improvement on a year ago - when it was closer to a third - the remaining 53 per cent of announced cell manufacturing capacity is still at medium or high risk of being delayed, scaled down or cancelled without stronger government action.

Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility supply chains at T&E, said: 'Batteries, and metals that go into them, are the new oil. European leaders will need laser sharp focus and joined-up thinking to reap their climate and industrial benefits.

'Strong sustainability requirements, such as the upcoming battery carbon footprint rules, can reward local clean manufacturing. Crucially, Europe needs better instruments under the European Investment Bank and EU Battery Fund to support gigafactory investments.'

France, Germany and Hungary have made the most progress in securing gigafactory capacity.

In France, ACC started production in Pas-de-Calais last year while plants by Verkor in Dunkirk and Northvolt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, are going ahead thanks to generous government subsidies.

The UK is among other European nations including Finland, Norway and Spain where most production capacity at medium or high risk due to question marks over projects.

This is due to the ongoing uncertainty around the West Midlands Gigafactory, despite huge £1billion investment from Nissan and battery partner EV Envision AESC for the construction of two plants close to the Sunderland car factory.

Tata, owners of Jaguar Land Rover, last year also confirmed it will build a huge £4billion electric car battery site in Somerset with financial backing from the Government.

Many European car makers source batteries from overseas markets, notably China, as they await the completion of a number of battery 'gigafactories' on the continent. This includes the £1bn EnvisionAESC-Nissan battery plant in Sunderland (pictured) set to open in 2025

A model of the proposed new electric battery factory JLR's owner, Tata, has confirmed in Somerset. It will cost a massive £4bn and be on stream by 2026, the company says

The report went on to warn that securing other parts of the battery value chain will be even more challenging given China's dominance and the EU's 'nascent expertise'.

For instance, Europe currently only has the potential to manufacture 56 per cent of its demand for cathodes - the battery's most valuable components - by 2030, but only two plants have started commercial operations so far.

By the end of this decade, the region could also fulfil all of its processed lithium needs and secure between 8 and 27 per cent of battery minerals from recycling in Europe.

But T&E said processing and recycling plants need EU and state support to scale quickly.

The report warns that securing other parts of the battery value chain will be even more challenging given China's dominance and the EU's 'nascent expertise'

The study found that the majority of UK EV battery production site plans are at medium risk

Poliscanova added: 'The battery race between China, Europe and the US is intensifying.

'While some battery investments that were at risk of being lured away by US subsidies have been saved since last year, close to half of planned production is still up for grabs.'

She went on to add that the European Union's decision last year to allow the sales of combustion engine to continue after 2035 provided they use climate-neutral 'e-fuels' has added uncertainty and says it is fundamental to have clarity on petrol and diesel phase-out to 'set corporate EV targets to assure gigafactory investors that they will have a guaranteed market for their product'.

The UK Government has said it will commit to outlawing the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, though has kept the door open for green e-fuels if they are proven to cut emissions dramatically.",thisismoney.co.uk,news,This is Money,Rob Hull,0.1137254901960785,453348516,1,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/13/12/84795857-0-image-m-81_1715601367613.jpg,

While this is an improvement on a year ago - when it was closer to a third - the remaining 53 per cent of announced cell manufacturing capacity is still at medium or high risk of being delayed, scaled down or cancelled without stronger government action.

Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility supply chains at T&E, said: 'Batteries, and metals that go into them, are the new oil. European leaders will need laser sharp focus and joined-up thinking to reap their climate and industrial benefits.

'Strong sustainability requirements, such as the upcoming battery carbon footprint rules, can reward local clean manufacturing. Crucially, Europe needs better instruments under the European Investment Bank and EU Battery Fund to support gigafactory investments.'

France, Germany and Hungary have made the most progress in securing gigafactory capacity.

In France, ACC started production in Pas-de-Calais last year while plants by Verkor in Dunkirk and Northvolt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, are going ahead thanks to generous government subsidies.

The UK is among other European nations including Finland, Norway and Spain where most production capacity at medium or high risk due to question marks over projects.

This is due to the ongoing uncertainty around the West Midlands Gigafactory, despite huge £1billion investment from Nissan and battery partner EV Envision AESC for the construction of two plants close to the Sunderland car factory.

Tata, owners of Jaguar Land Rover, last year also confirmed it will build a huge £4billion electric car battery site in Somerset with financial backing from the Government.

Many European car makers source batteries from overseas markets, notably China, as they await the completion of a number of battery 'gigafactories' on the continent. This includes the £1bn EnvisionAESC-Nissan battery plant in Sunderland (pictured) set to open in 2025

A model of the proposed new electric battery factory JLR's owner, Tata, has confirmed in Somerset. It will cost a massive £4bn and be on stream by 2026, the company says

The report went on to warn that securing other parts of the battery value chain will be even more challenging given China's dominance and the EU's 'nascent expertise'.

For instance, Europe currently only has the potential to manufacture 56 per cent of its demand for cathodes - the battery's most valuable components - by 2030, but only two plants have started commercial operations so far.

By the end of this decade, the region could also fulfil all of its processed lithium needs and secure between 8 and 27 per cent of battery minerals from recycling in Europe.

But T&E said processing and recycling plants need EU and state support to scale quickly.

The study found that the majority of UK EV battery production site plans are at medium risk

Poliscanova added: 'The battery race between China, Europe and the US is intensifying.

'While some battery investments that were at risk of being lured away by US subsidies have been saved since last year, close to half of planned production is still up for grabs.'

She went on to add that the European Union's decision last year to allow the sales of combustion engine to continue after 2035 provided they use climate-neutral 'e-fuels' has added uncertainty and says it is fundamental to have clarity on petrol and diesel phase-out to 'set corporate EV targets to assure gigafactory investors that they will have a guaranteed market for their product'.

But over half of Europe's battery production plans are at risk without stronger government action.

Onshoring the EV supply chain to Europe would cut the emissions of producing a battery by 37% compared to a China-controlled supply chain, according to new analysis by Transport & Environment (T&E). This carbon saving rises to over 60% when renewable electricity is used. Producing Europe's demand for battery cells and components locally would save an estimated 133 Mt of CO2 between 2024 and 2030, equivalent to the total annual emissions of Czechia.

But less than half (47%) of the lithium-ion battery production planned for Europe up to 2030 is secure, the report also finds. This is up from one-third a year ago following a raft of measures put in place to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act. The remaining 53% of announced cell manufacturing capacity is still at medium or high risk of being delayed, scaled down or cancelled without stronger government action.

Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and emobility supply chains at T&E, said: ""Batteries, and metals that go into them, are the new oil.

In his view, ""spreading nuclear power all around"" and accelerating the electrification of road transportation are the key preconditions for a safe, timely, responsible and carbon-neutral future.

Responsible energy policy is always a matter of mathematics, as there is always a number for a country's demand over a certain period, and physics, from the perspective of infrastructure, which determines where a country can get gas and oil from through pipelines, for example. It is how Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary Péter Szijjártó defined it in a keynote speech today at Belgrade Energy Forum.

Safety and security of energy supply must always be the number one priority, alongside environmental protection, he pointed out. It is only possible to address the two aspects if energy policy is ""no longer a hostage of ideology and hypocrisy,"" according to Szijjártó.

The composition of a national energy mix must be a sovereign decision of a country and its specificities must be taken into consideration, Hungary's top energy policy maker stressed at the conference, organized by Balkan Green Energy News.

""Spreading nuclear power all around"" and accelerating the electrification of road transportation are the key preconditions for a safe, timely, responsible and carbon-neutral future, Szijjártó warned. The global increase in industrial production, heating and cooling and transportation demand are set to double the consumption of electricity by the end of the decade, in his view.

Ideological debates are leaving the physical reality totally out of consideration, Hungary's top diplomat and energy policy maker said at the conference

Nuclear energy can safely and reliably provide enough reliable and cheap electricity while protecting nature, the minister underscored. Without a faster transition of road transportation to electric mobility, there is ""no hope"" that green goals would stay within reach, he claimed.

""If you look back at the recent years, it's easy to see that energy policy has become a hostage of ideological debates and hypocrisy. And these debates are leaving the physical reality totally out of consideration. This approach has been reflected in the sanctions which have been implemented by the European Union against Russia. While the Western European countries are so proud about themselves getting rid of Russian oil, for example, it's easy to understand why Europe became the number one customer of Indian oil and why Russia has increased its share from 0.5% to 35%"" in Indian oil imports, Szijjártó stated.

Moreover, he said that the EU rejects requests from Central European countries, among which he counts Serbia as well, for financial assistance to increase gas pipeline capacity in the continent's southeast. The administration in Brussels argues that gas won't be part of the energy mix anymore in 15 years, the minister added.

""When it comes to the proud Western European countries again, highlighting that they got rid of Russian gas, the reality is was the number one customer of Russian gas last month. And the biggest share of LNG in Western European ports is Russian gas,"" Szijjártó said.

As for nuclear energy, he highlighted an example from Hungary. The government has signed a deal for the construction of the Paks 2 facility with Russian state-owned company Rosatom. On the ground, there are German, French and American subcontractors, paid by the Russians, the minister noted.

He interpreted the situation by saying that business leaders have ""maintained common sense.""

A further 73 charging points with 350 kW power will supply fresh electricity for heavy commercial vehicles and electric trucks. The cross-border Cross-E project, which is subsidised by the EU with 34.45 million euros as part of the AFIF tender, is being implemented by the four partners Allego, Emobility Solutions, GreenWay and Petrol Group.

The charging points are to be installed in Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. Richard Ferrer, European Commission, Head of the Alternative Fuels Sector at CINEA, the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency, said: ""With this large-scale ambitious project, the European Union is supporting an important new phase to decarbonise mobility in Europe, in particular through the deployment of an electric recharging infrastructure for heavy-duty vehicles, right at the moment the first electric trucks are delivered on the market. Together with the 4 involved private frontrunners, we stay fully committed to achieve Green Deal objectives for the benefit of EU citizens and economic operators!""

Mathieu Bonnet, Chief Executive Officer of Allego, said: ""The demand for charging is growing as EVs take more of the market share in Europe. Charging infrastructure is pivotal in enabling a seamless transition to a fully electric fleet. By collaborating with Emobility Solutions, GreenWay, and Petrol who share our vision of a future characterized by emission-free mobility, we are poised to bring this shared vision to fruition.""

In total, the partners plan to invest 130 million euros in high-power charging infrastructure, with the European Union providing a total grant of 34.45 million euros. The project is due to be completed by October 2026.

The Cross-E installations will adhere to the European Commission's Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), which guarantees open access to charging infrastructure. All sites will therefore be accessible to the public 24/7 and will support roaming and freely accessible payment methods such as NFC, credit cards and app-based payments. The installation of charging stations specifically for heavy-duty commercial vehicles in selected markets will also provide insights for a broader installation in all project partners and countries.

Janos Ungar, Chief Executive Officer of Emobility Solutions, added: ""We believe that regional CEF projects like CROSS-E are the foundations towards a green, sustainable and reliable zero emission road transportation. Emobility Solutions has a decade of experience in European electric mobility infrastructure development, and it is an honour being able to represent Hungary in this cooperation, as we know that still a lot of work must be done to increase the number of high-power chargers along the highways, while maximising the utilization of the renewable energy.

Bart Biebuyck, CEO of Green Energy Park with over 20 years of experience in the hydrogen industry, discusses how his company will do things differently.

Hydrogen is a somewhat elusive molecule to be used as fuel. While it is an extremely efficient and emissionless fuel, the sticking point has been the lack of infrastructure to support it, i.e. industries using hydrogen fuel, amount being produced, etc., as well as the emissions created in its production.

The Innovation Platform's Matt Brundrett sat down with Bart Biebuyck to talk about Green Energy Park, and what he thinks will be a future that will solve these issues in both hydrogen production, and supply and distribution. Bart, with his vast experience in the hydrogen industry, expands on his headship of a public private partnership with the European Commission, and explains how they will lead the way forward.

Green Energy Park is a vertically integrated company that focuses on the production of hydrogen and ammonia in the upstream. Then, in the midstream, bringing that to different consumers in the distribution channel, and finally in the downstream, delivering to the gate of companies. We strongly believe that being vertically integrated is the best way to create a sustainable, viable, and economical hydrogen economy because the hydrogen economy is not yet mature, so there are too many variables. Being completely vertically integrated is, in our opinion, the way forward.

And this is precisely what we are doing with Green Energy Park. That's why we are starting to build the world's largest hydrogen and ammonia production facility in Brazil; then, we will bring its product to various ports worldwide. We are in talks with several ports in Europe. We have our own European import terminal on the Croatian island of Krk. This is where we have the Green Energy Park Krk, and the other ports we are working with are in the UK, north and northwest Europe, and the Middle East and the Far East.

From there, we are in discussion with various customers that we will bring hydrogen and ammonia to. They are located in northern Italy, south Germany, Austria, the Balkan countries, Croatia, Hungary, and Slovakia. This is where we believe we must gradually build a sustainable hydrogen economy. Of course, more energy parks will be built in the future, and we are already in discussion with other locations worldwide about setting up similar hydrogen production facilities.

In Brazil, we found all the elements required to make what I believe will be the world's most affordable hydrogen and ammonia. We have a 100% green grid, a free trade zone, and a very close location to our brand-new port. We're going to operate the export terminal in the state of Piauí. On top of that, we have excellent support from the local government, which believes in hydrogen and has a hydrogen strategy.

Furthermore, many Brazilian developers have concrete plans to produce renewable energy from solar and wind, but do not find off takers as the grid already 100% green. We will enable them and receive electricity and renewables at a very sharp price. We also have access to fresh water as we are very close to a river. All those elements together mean we can produce hydrogen and ammonia at a very affordable price.

We also have a lot of land there; around 800 hectares of free trade zone for ourselves, and we will use around 310 hectares. That leaves space open for off-takers of the ammonia and hydrogen locally. I'm sure there might be other locations of interest in the future. But for the moment, we feel that all the elements are there in Piauí to make a sustainable business case for hydrogen.

The development will be across four phases. The first phase will construct a 1.8-gigawatt electrolyser starting operation in 2028. Then phase 2 will add another 1.8 gigawatts in 2030, another 1.8 gigawatts in 2032, and finally, we will add 5.4 gigawatts in 2035. The entire project will be fully operational by then, and will be a demonstration of how to make hydrogen economical.

We will produce around 2.4 million tonnes of hydrogen, leading to more than 10 million tonnes of ammonia, depending on the conversion rate and technology we use. We will deliver most of that to Europe because Europe is hungry for energy and needs to go green. Today, there are relatively few renewables available in Europe, so we need to bring these renewable electrons to Europe, which will be one of the biggest off-takers.

We are also looking to the UK, as they, too, are very energy-hungry. The Middle East may also be an exciting area to look at. It is generally believed that the Middle East will always export energy, and so far, they have done so, but I'm not sure that will always be the case. They will be competitive in their export of renewable energy versus other parts of the world. So, I could envision that the Middle East might import energy in the future and use it to create other added-value products. And then there is also the Far East. If you look at Japan, South Korea, Singapore, etc., they also need a lot of energy, especially renewable energy, so we are also looking at these markets.

Globally, there is a race to address climate targets. We need new technologies and a lot of renewables. We cannot decarbonise our entire society by electricity alone; we will also need molecules. There aren't many projects worldwide, at least at such a scale, that will produce a lot of green molecules, so to reach the government's 2035, 2040, 2050, etc. targets, current income streams are not enough if we want to become net zero. We will need to build many facilities to create green molecules and truly implement them as a part of decarbonisation pathways.

There are a lot of industries that cannot use electricity very easily and will need to use molecules for energy. A lot of the time, those are also the industries that are putting out a lot of emissions. If you look only at the steel industry, 7% of global CO2 emissions come from steel. Our project fits wonderfully with all of the aforementioned targets and will help governments' achieve their targets. Furthermore, our project is now part of the Global Gateway initiative. This is the European initiative undertaken by the EU Member States and the European Commission to build closer relationships with countries in Latin America and countries in Africa. Last year, the President of the European Commission went to Brazil and, in June, announced that they would invest in Brazil, including the hydrogen value chain. Thus, we are now one of the projects that are part of that hydrogen value chain in Brazil.

We are currently discussing the financial support we will receive under that framework. Other facilities are in operation in Brazil because of the innovation there. As such, we are also looking at funds that can help with the engineering activity we must undertake. Ultimately, we aim to deliver a hydrogen or ammonia price that is competitive with today's fossil-fuel-based prices once the project is completed and operational.

I strongly believe that we need to go in that direction and show that it's economical and viable. This is why, together with Green Energy Park's top-down team, including an engineering company, an EPCM company, and a solid financial company with a lot of experience, we have developed a business model, new engineering, and a new way of financing. It's quite an innovative business model, which is also part of our IP. When we explain that business model to various banks, be it private or institutional, they all love this new business model.

That's why I feel there is traction in the financial world. We have received a great deal of enthusiasm when discussing and demonstrating our method to build a viable and economical hydrogen economy. I have even had several people tell me I've cracked the code. Today, one of the biggest issues is that many projects do not reach FID because they have various issues with their business model.

We worked hard here because we have an in-house engineering company with one of the brightest engineers in Process Engineering, tank engineering, etc. Combined with brilliant people in the financial world, they came up with that very interesting model that got a lot of traction when tested in the financial world. And so, yes, we're likely to get a lot of development funding, but I think our new approach convinces many investors. I believe this is what was necessary. We cannot keep it business as usual and do things like we always have. You need to innovate, not only in engineering but also financially.

There's already a massive market for ammonia. Today, a lot of grey ammonia is being used worldwide; almost 200 million tonnes of ammonia consumption worldwide. However, this is from fossil-fuel-based ammonia. Of course, this needs to go green. I think there's not such a big problem with import/export or handling because the world knows how to deal with ammonia. There are a lot of skilled people and companies who know what to do, and that is part of our joint venture. They have built several ammonia terminals, including the biggest ammonia tank in operation in the world. The challenge is, of course, what do you do with the hydrogen? Making ammonia from hydrogen is a known technology. However, converting back to hydrogen is still a challenge, and technology is still being developed.

We believe our technology is quite innovative for ammonia cracking. Our cracking technology can also solve issues with exporting to different customers. Bringing hydrogen to your import terminal and then to the customer is challenging.

We all know that building a hydrogen economy will take a decade, if not more, before everything is in place. Plus, not all the big companies, or even small and medium enterprises, are located next to the backbone. A lot of work is still needed to bring the hydrogen to each of those companies. But with our technology and solutions, we have created a way to get hydrogen to companies' gates in a financially affordable way.

Green Energy Park Krk (GEPK) is a unique import facility. Krk is a Croatian island on the north side of the Adriatic Sea, the closest location to south Germany and northern Italy. GEPK is a 156-hectare brownfield plot that used to be an external chemical plant, which we can now use for the green energy future.

From GEPK, we can supply northern Italy, Austria, south Germany, the Balkan regions, and local markets like Croatia and Slovenia. At the moment, most European projects focus on Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and those ports. But south-central Europe is not as well supplied. So with Krk, which is uniquely located, we can supply those regions; there's a lot of interest.

Many companies are interested in supplying or sourcing green molecules from GEPK. What is beautiful is that our facility is also a port. We have 16m of natural depth; this is very important because ships carrying ammonia are heavier and need at least 14.5m of depth. We don't need to dredge, as it's a deep natural port. Furthermore, the port is in the Bay of Rijeka, meaning the waves are very moderate; there is no significant movement of sand or silt. This is also good for the shipments in terms of loading and unloading the shipping, as the ships do not rock much.

We also have a natural gas pipeline that is already hydrogen-ready. Once the Croatian government decides to stop natural gas and switch to hydrogen, we can immediately inject it from our side because the gas pipeline starts and runs on our side. Therefore, GEPK is already a part of the European hydrogen economy. In the future, there will also be a direct rail connection to the other side and the possibility of a pipeline going towards the refineries on the other side of the bay. So there are a lot of potential off-takers in the neighbourhood, as well as the potential to get hydrogen in large volumes off the island to major regions like northern Italy and south Germany.

I've already worked in the hydrogen industry for more than 20 years. I started my career at Toyota Motor Europe on the design team for the first Toyota hydrogen car, the Mirai. I worked with my team on the Mirai for more than seven years, ensuring it was ready for the European market. I also built, the first hydrogen refuelling station in Belgium, over ten years ago. At that time, there was little talk about hydrogen power and little knowledge among hydrogen authorities. A lot of education was needed for all different stakeholders. But we built it, and it's still operational today.

After we launched the Mirai and opened the hydrogen refuelling station, I had the opportunity to go to the European Commission to be the head of the world's biggest hydrogen and fuel cell research programme. And so I was heading a €2.4bn research programme for seven years. I think we financed more than 1,100 companies in the field of hydrogen fuel cells; a total of around 360 projects in the meantime received funds. It was an exciting environment to work in because you saw all the latest technology, which technology works, which technology needs some development before it works, etc., so I learned a lot.

For me, it was essential to demonstrate how to make the hydrogen economy a reality. Every week, I saw companies coming up with projects and PowerPoints. But if you look at the latest IEA report, there are probably around 1,400 projects worldwide in hydrogen and fuel cells, and only 3.6% get FID; it made me a bit sad. However, I also embraced the challenge to show the world how we can realise a hydrogen economy. To achieve this, after leaving the European Commission in May last year, I started Green Energy Park Global with my team, who truly are the best of the best.

With a big, well-known engineering company, a well-known EPC company and somebody who saw everything in the financial world, together we set out to show the world how we can reach climate goals because to reach the 1.5 degrees climate target in 2050, we need to build about 6,000 gigawatts-worth of electrolysers to produce all the hydrogen and ammonia, or methanol that we need to decarbonise our economy. That's a huge amount. Currently, the biggest electrolyser in operation in Europe is 20 megawatts, a fraction of what we need. And we have just 25 years to build 6,000 gigawatts of renewables and electrolysers, a massive challenge for humanity.

I want to contribute by showing a way forward and making hydrogen an economically viable case. And I'm thrilled that we succeeded. Of course, a lot still needs to be built, but as I said before, we are checking our model and designs because our engineers have already started designing a large part of our plot. When we show it to strategic partners, companies that have worked for years in this field, or investment banks, they say it's fantastic. One CTO of a large company said: ""Every day, I see presentations, and every week, some developers and companies show me their plans on hydrogen and ammonia. But this is my first time seeing something that might actually work."" I think it's clear that we are on the right track to deliver a method that can accelerate the entire hydrogen industry and reach the 6,000 gigawatts required by 2050.",innovationnewsnetwork.com,news,Innovation News Network,Megan Traviss,0.3098039215686275,453302617,7,https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ZAKARAS1-29179-shutterstock_Deemerwha-studio_2311223577.jpg,eng-9561767

Imports are expected to rise to 19,484 megawatt hours (Mwh), beating the record of 18,649 Mwh at the end of March after the first wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy sector.

""The power system has been experiencing a significant electricity shortage for most of the day,"" national power grid operator Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app.

""The reason for this is large-scale damage to Ukrainian power plants, which means they cannot produce as much electricity as before the attack.""

The ministry said that, with the country facing a significant deficit in the system, it plans to import power from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova on Monday.

The grid operator said that emergency assistance from the European Union had already been provided from midnight to this morning, adding that power curbs for industrial consumers are expected this evening.

""Restricting consumption is a necessary measure to maintain the stability of the power system after the fifth targeted missile attack on power plants this year,"" the operator said.

Last week's combined attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure caused serious damage at three thermal power plants, piling more pressure on the country's power grid.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, dealing significant damage and causing blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have resulted in more than $1 billion of damage to the sector, said Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko.

Thermal and hydropower facilities as well as power transmission systems bore the brunt of the attacks, resulting in the loss of about 80% of Ukraine's thermal power generation capacity and increasing reliance on its three nuclear power plants, which produce about 50% of the country's electricity.",dailysabah.com,news,Daily Sabah,Reuters,-0.4352941176470588,453299067,10,https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2024/05/13/thumbs/800x531/327644.jpg,eng-9569221

Romantsova","What is the state of human rights regarding the aggression by Russia against Ukraine in early 2024?

*Further original, internal sources are at the bottom of the article.*

*Interview conducted April 16, 2024.*

Ms. Oleksandra Romantsova is the Executive Director (2018-present) of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 under her and others' leadership in documenting war crimes. This will be a live series on human rights from a leading expert in an active context from Kyiv, Ukraine. Here, we talk about updates from February 5 to April 16.

Scott Douglas Jacobsen: Okay, so today, we are here for our fourth interview with Oleksandra Romantsova of the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, Ukraine. We have been covering the human rights aspects or facets of the Russo-Ukrainian war based on Russian aggression into Ukraine starting, in terms of a full-scale invasion, on February 24, 2022. I am based out of nearby Montreal, Quebec, Canada, so the time zones are more helpful this time than from Vancouver. Our last interview was February 5. So, we will start with the reportage from that time and continue forward from there. I will begin with a general sense. What have been some of the changes in tactics and some of the newer human rights trends you have noticed in the Spring of 2024 so far?

Oleksandra Romantsova: First of all, that was the opening of the second warrant of the chief of the army of the Russian Federation about shelling the civilian system. One of them made some little breaks, which was interesting. When you have this break, nobody attacks you via rockets. You are thinking about when they start to do that. It started months before. Now, it is the middle of April. That was the middle of March. They started shelling every day, during the day. It can be 50 rockets, some drones, or something like that. If something happened in Kyiv, then this means something happened in Dnipro, Zapirozhzhia, Mykolaiv, and other places. So, the main change is that they attack concrete electricity systems. They stopped doing that. We waited in the Winter because it is usually more painful without electricity, but they started in the Spring. Before that, Ukraine was a big country that produced much electricity. We sell it. We have many rivers with the stations. They try to destroy bigger stations. Which is called Dnipro station [Ed. Dinpro hydroelectric dam], these systems are regularly attacked now.], It was built during the Soviet Union. Before, there was an explosion by Hitler's army. So, for image, it is a wrong decision for the Russian military to try and destroy it. They supply a few rockets to them. However, it still works now. They have some images, but not crucial. They are trying to stop Ukraine, try not to allow us to have businesses, economics - any processes. Things people can need or want: leave Ukraine, etc. I do not know the main idea behind this targeting. People will speak about fighting. The more problems we have, the less support we have from the US, and the fewer shells we have. If they figure out the channels and what they are trying to do, they will put much effort into propaganda in the United States. They want to show it is not an important question - Ukraine - and Israel is more important. The US is totally in the process of election now. They are not so quick to make this decision. This means we are prepared to fight but do not have enough arms. That is a big problem. It is a big problem for us because it means that every day, people die there on the frontline. People are dying here because we do not have enough shells. We do not have enough shells to destroy their rockets, which they send to our cities. We know that. We have the skills, but we do not have the tools to implement what we know. It is the situation. This means that things have changed a lot inside Ukraine. It is primarily a reaction to that.

Jacobsen: What about the European Union providing finance, shells, and fighter jets?

Romantsova: The European Union decided to support us, meaning they will start producing more shells and can help us after a year. We must survive this year without enough shells, so that is the problem.

Jacobsen: With regards to the gridlock happening in a lot of American political cycles, is it more or less accurate when Zelensky states that if the United States does not support Ukraine with more resources, the Russian Federation is likely to take much Ukrainian territory if not win the war against Ukraine? [Ed. The new bill was passed on April 20, 2024, to support Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. Likewise, The Associated Press reported on ways military aid can be expedited. The expectation is a giant spring of aggression by the Russian Federation forces. NATO and others look to air defences for Ukraine. Kremlin claims America is repeating Vietnam-like humiliation, and more deaths will follow the aid package.]

Romantsova: Good question. The biggest problem is that people forget about the situation. The situation can get worse, not better. It is not a good position for politicians. People think of the Ukrainian war as a usual thing. Some politicians state this as a typical war, a usual thing. They say, ""Ukrainians will fight. It will be long. So, Ukrainians can do that alone."" However, we cannot... we can be finished. All of us who stay here will fight. All who do not will not prepare to continue to fight. They will start just going to other countries. It creates a crisis. Even certain millions of people are not easy for Europe; this makes them less and less comfortable. Is it possible Ukraine will fall? Yes, it is possible. It means all of us will be dead. It is impossible to have a miracle. Something is blowing up in the political system of the Russian Federation. If it happens, all of us will be surprised. It is not exactly what you can plan. You can say, ""Everyone, we planned that. We account for that or something like that."" No, we have one chance. It will be fought until the Russian Federation breaks down at the economic or political level, but it will not take one month. It takes years. That is why, for us, it is essential to remember the USA. It is not a question that some Ukrainians ask more than others. It is a question: If Ukraine will lose, it will be a problem for all of Europe. Some countries like Hungary or Slovenia have started collaborating with Russia. It is not so big, the castle. It can be the point of turn that can be a game changer. Although this situation is game-changing, it can be like this now. That is why we speak with Americans; even Europe will start to support us with the same money. However, you cannot shoot with cash. It would help if you hit with guns. So, we need guns. Most of the guns that we need are in America. As you know, the Canadian army cannot help.

Jacobsen: No, they have been in a tough spot now. They have also been shrinking for a while, even within an infusion of over $70 billion over several years [Ed. Two decades.]. The Canadian army is in a tough spot ethically and politically. Even though Canadian citizens who are not serving members will give contradictory or seemingly conflicting responses in surveys, on the one hand, Canadians will want Canadian forces to be more active in international affairs. Still, most do not want to serve in the first place. Fundamentally, they want to help other nations with their problems, but they do not want to be the ones troubled with helping those problems. There are violations of the rights of men and women in service. Internationally, in terms of NATO commitments, because we were well below even the minimum standard of relative GDP contribution (2%) to the Canadian Armed Forces, we may send 1,500 service members to Latvia; however, in general, we are pretty limited in our contributions internationally, except, maybe, in training, where we might train Ukrainian captains in French. Also, we have ancient equipment across the board, from rifles to submarines. So, on the Canadian side, I would not expect significant contributions from the Canadian Armed Forces for some time.

Romantsova: Canada has provided good financial support. However, that is the problem. You cannot eat money. You cannot shoot money. You need money transformed into something. Most of the support for our budget is limited only to social needs. So, that means that is why Russia attacks concrete suppliers, power plants, etc. Because we need 40% of our budget, which is produced by our economy, in steel, only this 40% can be used for arms, guns, and supporting the army. All other support from outside of Ukraine has conditions. We can use it only for salaries and pensions. Stuff like this. That is why it is so important to get support from the USA; support from the USA was for arms. That is the difference.

Jacobsen: One political commentator in the United States commented on the effect of weakening an enemy or rival nation with violent intent while also supporting a country in need and a more robust and muscular ally, which is a win-win situation. Also, the creation of those arms strengthens the American economy. It would be a positive in general for the American State. Now, about the human rights conditions of citizens, the newer actions or the stronger push has been toward the targeting of critical infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian Federation forces. People probably will not see this video, but the lights are off in your place. They are not off in mine. Even in Kyiv, they are targeting electrical grids and stations. How is this change to try to terrorize the public even more, impacting the trends of fighting and then the morale of the public at large?

Romantsova: It is a good question. During this time, we have one month of changes to legislation for recruitment and mobilization to the army. Many people do not like these changes. A lot of these people do not like these changes. What other decision can be made? No, you are not like this. What do you propose as a way to do this? So, but still, as for me, it is understandable. All of us, my team, and I, have the opportunity to work only because people from frontlines support us. They help us because they defend us. We are here because it is not our turn to go to the frontline. Maybe it happened. Perhaps it happened that even such a person who does not have any war specialization or something needs to go to the frontline. It is possible. As for me, it is still a big question. How does the army need to be organized? What kind of solution? What kind of weapons? What type of ammunition do people need? Because we will always have fewer people than Russia because Russia is four times bigger by population and four times less attractive to save someone. So, they do not care. They may care about some generals or professionals but do not care about soldiers. So, they can send thousands of them to kill a few Ukrainians because for them... we see this the last ten years. They do not care even about their population. It is a big problem. We call this an asymmetric answer. So, if they have many soldiers, we must have a lot of technology, such as drones. A lot of this is not about human rights. It is tough to speak about human rights when you have such a situation with war and your situation of security. So, from our side, we have not changed from the other side.

People still give their donations and lots of donations. Ukrainians collect the money and send it to volunteers for the technology, which they believe supports our citizens on the front lines. Drones, for example, or 'a system of audio fighting,' may be translated like this. It protects soldiers from drones from the Russian side. It still happens through NGOs. Minister of Defense they have their process. However, they are still working through NGOs, just through NGOs.

Jacobsen: How is the public morale in Ukraine now? Does it vary by city, or is there a general high or a general low?

Romantsova: All of us are tired and depressed. However, it does not change the situation. Yes, we are pretty not the politest and kindest people now. When people speak about an attack in Moscow, we are not celebrating, but we are not waiting or something. Israel was attacked. I have friends in Israel. However, sorry, all of this rocket and shell was destroyed before. However, nobody does that for Ukraine, and it is every day. Missiles killed people. The USA still discusses whether they need to support Ukraine or not. It is terrible competition. It can lead to more suffering from some war or not. However, it is still emotionally hurtful when people say, ""Ukraine is one country to get attacked every day."" It is injustice.

Jacobsen: Is the general idea that the Russian Federation is planning a more protracted war, given that it contributes one-third of its expenditures to the military?

Romantsova: Nobody knows what kind of plan Russia has. I think they need some victory. However, tomorrow, Putin can say to his population. ""We have a victory,"" and then stop the war. He can imagine. He can make his propaganda make any picture. We try to guess. They send more and more signals, not directly to Kyiv, but to different international parties. They want to have a negotiation. Now, they are on the negotiation side. We would be strong enough. If they stop this line and lead by their control of more than 21% of our territory and more than 6,000,000 people for them, it will look good enough for them. For us, it is destroying any opportunity to bring back these people. We do not know how many lives are changed because Russians kill every day. It is the same thing. We do not see what happens with kidnappings. First of all, it is not a question. I do not have an answer. I have the purpose to fight. I do not know what the end will be -- peace for us. If we exist, it means they bring back all of our people and are protected from Russia. It is important. Ukrainians do not like fighting. Ukrainians fight because we have no other choice but to defend ourselves. We will stop the fight if someone proposes another way to define ourselves. I think it is okay for us to look to other situations. People need to be released. It is important.

Jacobsen: In late February, President Zelensky went to Saudi Arabia to push for peace in a push for POWs in Russia. How was the POW (prisoner of war) situation with Ukraine and Russia? Has anything gone forward about exchanges?

Romantsova: They (POWs) are still there. They have one or two exchanges. That is all. It begs the question about civilians. We do not have only prisoners like combatants who are going to become prisoners of war. Also, all the prisoners of war, when they return to us, are in bad condition. They torture them. It is a good question. The status of prisoners of war is a status in international humanitarian law, which needs to protect you if you recognize the other side, e.g., prisoners of war. They need to care about you, give you food and normal conditions, not extremely hot or cold. You need to get medicine support if you need it. It would help if you had the opportunity to make contact with your family. Russia does not do anything of that, mainly through an International Committee of the Red Cross. So, you can be judged through the court because you take the duty in the army. Russia breaks even this. So, they put them in jail, some prisoners. It is like a big argument from Russia's side when trading inside negotiations. That is why they take people. They only need the people to press Ukraine down for the arguments as to why their proposition needs to be taken. Until now, many NGOs here, every day, including prisoners of war and civilian prisoners, have different communication campaigns around the world about that. Still, it is a point number for politicians in policy. It is still painful here.

Jacobsen: What about the elections in the Russian Federation with these murders, etc.?

Romantsova: It is like the election of President Putin, which wins President Putin. It is not an election. For 20 years, the Russian Federation has not had any elections. It is like Belarus. Nobody believes it is an election. Navalny is trying to push it in some way to use the mechanisms. They are trying to use different tools to create some intrigue there. However, no, it is always the election of President Putin. Now, it is illegally recognized. They include in this election occupied territory, and they make this illegal process poison. The election will be the same with Lukashenko (Belarus). Lukashenko was not recognized for the last election. Putin, as I understood, the European Union has this position. I do not hear about the consensus of West's voices that now he is illegal. However, he still leads the Russian Federation.

Jacobsen: What about the UN nuclear watchdog director going to Moscow to discuss nuclear safety in Ukraine? Was there any result from that?

Romantsova: Nuclear safety in Ukraine is one of the most significant results, not because they released the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. They think it has much more of a role than India, China, and somebody from the West to stop something terrible from happening. Macron changed his position in this way. He started answering, ""Okay, you are not alone with nuclear weapons."" It is a significant change. It is not because of Ukraine. It is because Wagner made a problem for the French army. You feel that you live on a small, connected Earth. That is the source of my optimism. We are still determining what we will indeed get from the Russian Federation. If China changes some positions, Russia will finally need to take back their army.

Jacobsen: Since joining NATO and ending its post-WWII neutrality, has Sweden made any moves to help in the Ukrainian efforts?

Romantsova: Most neutrality is an official status of some states like Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and Turkmenistan. It is funny that Turkmenistan has an official neutral status. You must have special voting, call signs, and unique documents at the UN. Switzerland is trying to take it back. Russia said they are an unfriendly country now since membership of NATO. Unless they lose it. In Europe, Austria stays in this status. Now, it is a big, big question. Maybe countries from Asia, Africa, etc., can take a spot. We are not counting this country. So, we are still looking to the West - America, Canada, maybe Germany, but we are not looking to other countries like Brazil, Argentina, or South Africa. These countries are in Africa. We are waiting, growing up, and starting a dialogue with all of these countries. They will not consistently be grown. A lot of them began to shoot during the negotiation. If African countries exist without any government but have an army and, sometimes, more arms than the Czech Republic or Poland, it is a huge question about the biggest problem that we still have. This terroristic act on the city hall near Moscow. It is part of this. They show this exactly when the Russian Federation is trying to concentrate its power and systems in Ukraine. They are open and vulnerable to other problems. Islamistic conflict between Russia and some groups, e.g., Russia supports the Taliban and ISIS. They are trying to kill them in Syria. All this continues. None of this stops because of the Ukrainian situation. I am trying to look at this round from the Ukrainian side. From the Ukrainian side, we need anything to fight and to survive. When we speak about the bigger picture, all of us need to not only look at Europe; we need to look around. It is not only Europe or a Western crisis. It is a crisis of the whole world.

Jacobsen: What about these human rights violations with regards to joining the Russian army, e.g., Indians being duped - Indian nationals, citizens - into joining the Russian Federation army and then fighting for them? They leave with an injury or something. Now, Indian authorities, at least since early March, are in early talks with Russian officers to deal with these kinds of human rights abuses of Indian nationals tricked into fighting for the Russian army based on false promises.

Romantsova: Look, Xenophobia in the Russian Federation is enormous. I do not think someone from another nation can come to the Russian army and will be enough in contact to be part of the rest. It is not possible. First, most Russians do not know other languages except Russian and rude Russian.

Jacobsen: Rude Russian?

Romantsova: It is from Fifth Element. It is trendy here. That was a phrase from the hero, Bruce Willis. 'I know only two languages. Rude words and English.' [Ed. ""Whoa, lady, I only speak two languages, English and bad English.""] Every time, they mention some nationality, such as Makhachkala. Makhachkala, they come to the airport and go to the airfield and try to take back from the plane; families, Jewish families, who were from Israel or something like this, or some other place, because it is a Muslim region.

The same situation now, when Crocus City Hall was attacked, these were guys from Turkmenistan. It is a part of the old Soviet Union, a separate country with a broad autocratic regime. Now, these people come to Russia to have a primitive... Whenever Russians have an opportunity to show their xenophobia, they do that. I cannot imagine people with dark skin, with absolutely no English, not the same English where they expect to hear from people. That is not the precise pronunciation that will be respected in the Russian Federation. I cannot even imagine. So, they will be killed, not by Russians, but sent without ammunition or something. They send, send, send people without any support. So, I do not know.

Jacobsen: On March 9, Pope Francis stated that Ukraine and its allies should, more or less, wave the white flag. Given the size of the Catholic Church worldwide, this comes from a prominent world religious leader. How was that met last month, the comment from the Pope?

Romantsova: The Pope said something. Ukrainians and their population are usually used to that.

Jacobsen: It was criticized and met on deaf ears.

Romantsova: In Ukraine, we have 72 different kinds of churches, including Jewish, old Oriental forms of Christianity like the Copts or Armenian Christian Church, Muslim, Russian, and Buddhist temples. It includes different kinds of Christianity: Baptist churches and old Russian churches. So, Greek and Catholic, it is an organized community. It is focused mainly on the western part of Ukraine. They connect it with the Pope. They first hear what the Pope will say because Ukrainians believe in the Pope of their church. All other people think, ""One more politician who says something. What can you expect?"" Most people do not make much distinction between the Pope and the president. They know it is in Italy and a separate country, blah-blah-blah. It exists, and people who work for that. My organization's head needs to meet with the Pope in the following months. The Pope, traditionally, is a figure who can make negotiations. We will be continuing to speak with them because he is still essential. He can say something.

Jacobsen: Not too long ago, Ukrainian forces lost the city of Avdiivka after several months of very, very intense fighting. What has been the social and political impact within the context of the war?

Romantsova: It is so interesting. You say a few months. A few actions cover it. Now, you cannot get the views. All of the social impacts of what happened. First of all, many soldiers commented about Avdiivka. They take it back earlier than in Bakhmut, but it takes two weeks or something like that. That is the effect on the population and its attention now. Two weeks after that, we had another problem. I am sure the family who lost someone there or soldiers who were angry for their combat that way. They organized getting out of there and taking them out of there. For them, that was different news. For the rest of the population, ""We had a terrible day on the frontline. What can we do to have a good day on the frontline?""

Jacobsen: What were the remaining presidential comments about Estonia becoming the next NATO alliance leader? Does this have worse or better political implications vis-a-vis NATO for Ukrainian support?

Romantsova: It is essential. Does the commentator take us there or not? We have some rules. They do not include new countries with a planned conflict or something like that. Every time we hear about someone, we will feel only one comment. If it is expected, will it be possible for them to take Ukraine tomorrow or not? If a specialist discusses how this person can be helpful or not for Ukraine membership, that's all.

Jacobsen: How extensively are prisoners of war being tortured by Russian forces? There are reports of Ukrainian prisoners of war being tortured in Russia. Is there an extent of how far this is going, or is it just general knowledge that there is torture being done to Ukrainian prisoners of war?

Romantsova: It has happened to all prisoners over the last ten years. When we take people back from there, they give testimonies about it. That is not just a torture. The whole scope of imagined horrors, Hollywood horrors, over the last 40 years, they use it, including sexual and gender-based violence. It is a huge, huge, massive variety of tortures. We have testimonies of people who went through that by themselves.

Jacobsen: It is reported that one-third of Russian warships in the Black Sea have been destroyed or disabled. Is this a significant win for the Ukrainian side of the war, or are more substantial wins or points of import for the Ukrainian military and Ukrainians in general more to do with air superiority and artillery now? In other words, are the Navy's victories not the sort of victories they need?

Romantsova: I cannot specifically comment on the military. Yes, I have friends. Some of my friends are on the frontline. They are mainly at the ordinary level of the army. So, I need insights or a deep understanding of it. People suffered. All of the relatives suffered. People were killed on the frontline. They are fighting. We are still not Russia. They have had enough success. That is all that I know.

Jacobsen: What about other nations that do not have outstanding human rights records supporting the war effort of the Russian Federation? Not merely Iran with drones or North Korea with missiles but significant support from the Chinese government based on intelligence reports.

Romantsova: Most countries or nations are in the Middle East or Central Asia. We do not understand all of this region, as we do not have a profound traditional relationship with them. We speak about Central Asia. It is a former Soviet Union country. That is why we have a connection, but it is not deep. Ukraine has most of its information from intelligence services, whether in diplomacy or trading. You can buy some information from commercials. For example, we buy from Sputnik and put them in space. So, when we speak about what kind of information we need for fighting and whether China, Iran, or India have some technologies to give information for fighting, do they have some support for Russia or some support for Ukraine? It is carefully secured information, where our army takes information. The British intelligence service only wants guys who regularly command something on the frontlines between Ukraine and Russia. It could have happened in other sources. However, for Ukrainian sources, we have many sources from British intelligence services -- they publicly have some commanders. So, this war depends on intelligence, not simply intelligence, but the cyber information database. The war information is only taken from cyberspace. For example, where is a power plant in Ukraine? You can try to use an old map from the Soviet Union.

In the same way, you can break this power plant's system management, which connects with primary sources in cyberspace. Cyberspace information is what you need in this conflict. Many people are involved in cyberspace fighting and cyberwarfare around our Ukrainian-Russian war. China plays a large part in that. I do not know if they will ever speak about that publicly. I do not know if they publicly support Russia, but Chinese hackers participate. I know that.

Jacobsen: The recent attack on Israel by Iran; I am mixing this because Russia uses the drones used by Iran in the Russo-Ukrainian war. There was a significant response from the Israelis and Americans. Reports are that at least 99% of those missiles and drones launched were taken down before impact. So, is there a lesson to be learned from that, given the fact that much of the long-distance being done can be done to Ukraine, whether infrastructure, residential areas, or military targets have to do with missiles and drones?

Romantsova: First, we must understand that Israel is small. Second, I need to find out the rockets used by Iran to make this strike and launch them. As I understand it, it is an excellent example that the USA or other countries have such technology, which can help us. They cover some parts of Ukraine. They may need help to do that for an extensive territory like Ukraine. If we compare Israel and Ukraine, the size difference is significant. So, Israel will always be protected by the USA. It is true. However, we need many negotiations to have the same status to negotiate a lot.

Jacobsen: Do the primary areas for winning significant hunks against the Russian Federation involve cyber operations, cyber warfare and economic warfare? If we look at critical economic indicators within the Russian Federation, things like the society's size and growth rate in terms of people brought in through immigration or being born there. Russia has been declining for at least two decades or stagnating yearly. By 2050, the estimates are that they will lose ten million people in their total population numbers. So, it is a shrinking population, as with China in the last couple of years...

Romantsova: But you know, Russia has had a demographic crisis before. That is why I told you about xenophobia but at the same time. Russia needs labour from Central Asian countries because Central Asian countries mostly have language, former Soviet Union countries, but Baltic countries are members of the EU. Most know the Russian language but will never come to Russia to be simple workers or work simple jobs. They will go to the EU if they need money. It is the same with Belarus. I am not going to Russia, but to Poland, for example. As you understand now, Ukrainians are in the same situation as Moldova. Georgia and Armenia are location countries. Azerbaijan has more profit and income than Russia, so they are not going to Russia to have money through simple work or labour. Georgians and Armenians are small, two small countries.

All of them have a problem with Russia. So, only Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, all of those countries. Now, more and more, as big as Kazakhstan, they are much more speaking about anti-colonialism directions because they accept colonialism (former). The colonial politics of the Russian Federation, so only Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, etc., are countries with small populations. Now, no one likes them - the Russian Federation - because of Crocus City Center. That was the first season in these countries who returned to countries - these Central Asian countries - more than they left them. That means that the Russian Federation lost its labourers from Central Asia.

I think at the end of the year. They will lose even more. They are not like before, giving citizenship to the labourers in Central Asia. Most of them prefer to have citizenship of the Russian Federation, but they do not provide them. They like to use them like simple, cheap labourers, but not a part of politicians and the electorate. It is a difficult situation. Putin is trying to solve this through Ukrainian children. That is one of the reasons why they steal or kidnap them. It is the same if we speak about the Ukrainian population. One of my dreams of Putin is to join the territory of Ukraine tak, take all of this, repeal Ukrainians into the Russian population and solve the demographic crisis like this. However, one of the ways they are trying to control the matrimonial function of women. They are trying to put the women or motivate the women to have more children. One of the ideas is a bill in parliament that states that women can have higher education if they do not have two children.

Jacobsen: So, if they have higher education, they cannot.

Romantsova: It is just a bill. It is not a law now. They can, like all previous stupid bills, accept. It can be a backstep. Women in the Russian Federation, you must have two children before deciding to take higher education at university. It is against the classical, traditional Soviet Union idea that everyone should have higher education. Most of the populations of the former Soviet Union countries have higher education. In Ukraine, 80% of people have higher education. It is the usual and traditional period of your life. It does not mean you are choosing to go to university or not. You are going to university, or you - we call them - have a budget place where the State pays. Second, your parents collect the money and try to give it to you. For example, it is less expensive here in Ukraine than in the USA. It is traditional for most people here to have a higher education in some way. So, that is turning back from the evolution of the Soviet Union time.

Jacobsen: There are also statements about women having eight or more children or being urged to have eight or more children by Russian Federation leadership. At the same time, they are really pushing in the media and bills, not laws, so far, but also restricting the psychology of women's freedom through the repeal of physical protections for women. If a woman feels unsafe in the home, she will not feel safe to go out to do things freely: to get an education, to get a job, to have different and varied friends, and so on. Things like the repeal of the domestic violence protection law so that legally, you can, as a husband, beat your wife in Russia. That is a form of psychological warfare, too, not just a non-penalization of a negative behaviour. That sort of thing. It is along the lines of what you are saying as well. Only if you have children can you go and have children, where it is part, as you mentioned earlier, of what was a Soviet idea at the time of having higher education.

Romantsova: The Soviet idea was different at different times. It was 17 years. There was absolute equality between men and women initially, even in the understanding. They were trying to break the family's knowledge. It is not necessary to have a family to have some sexual relationship or to have children. However, after all the control of the State, they understood that having a family is much more comfortable for control. So, they started to speak, ""Yes, sure, women have equal rights here. In the Soviet Union, they are like men."" Society waiting, ""Yes, you have a job, but you have a 'second job.'"" At home, you take care of the children. Soviet women were with children. Women who care about the house and the deficit. It is a result of a centralized economy, a centralized planning economy. Women were mainly responsible for taking stock, finding, and buying things. Loads of people do not have the opportunity to use money, and those who do not use it. Women were responsible for home management, and they had work. They have a traditional need to have an education. All of this is built on a new glass ceiling for women. Some women are ministers in history or chiefs at big industrial companies. But mostly, you will not find these names in the history. That was not usual. That was not normal because women usually mainly cared about their families. So, education for women. That was a must-have. So, now, Russia wants to change. Russia changed the mental map of regular societal roles in the Russian Federation. They decriminalized home violence. They take back all the other areas of your life, except family, which you can control. You can't control your business, what kind of political media comes. You can't control whether you will have war or not. You can control one: Your family, if you are a man. If you are a woman, you need to find a man because all other ways to be protected will not help. So, inside the family, the man controls; it comes to a system of breeding families until the end of the 19th century when only men had a relationship with the State. Women always have any relationship with the State only through the man. Only your husband or your brother or father is responsible for your status. They determine your status. It is something like this. It is much easier to control men who only have power inside the family, so young control the family. So, the man controls the wife and children through this process. It is one of the ways they do this, as well as religion. They support spreading this Russian Orthodox ideology. But in this way, they are falling. They fall because statistics show fewer and fewer young people in the Russian Federation attend church. They may be believers but not members of the church.

Jacobsen: They are following in the line, ironically, of most of the Western world, which is a stark decline in attendance and belief in organized religion, particularly Christianity.

Romantsova: What happened with Russia is not a surprise, but a big problem for them; it is Islamization. In this situation, Islam gives more answers than Christianity.

Jacobsen: How so?

Romantsova: Islam talks about the Islamic State. Any state is foul. It needs to be corrected. It's because they need to recognize national or political management. In Muslim ideology, all the rights of believers are with one nation, Summa. All of these national countries or nations are false. It is temporary. We will all be in one Islamic world. So, it is one of the strong ideologies if you don't like a state. Putin created a state that is a system that can be unlikeable in one moment. If people do not have an average education, Islam proposes a sound system and understanding why Putin is wrong and all states are a bad idea. Allah did not create the states. So, that is all false. It is happening, first of all, in the jails. Before, in the Russian Federation, imagine 1 million people in prisons; it is a lot. Before, there were black and red jails; we call them zona. It is a secured zone, a jail. Black jails exist. The system of law calls them ""person who steals something.""

People who steal: Thieves. It was like a vast system of thieves during the Soviet era who created their law system. That's romanticized. This parallel reality exists in the jails. These are huge complexes that thieves control. They have their law, economic system, and all of this. It is not a mafia. It is a law. It is not one organization but a system of law. They call them ""thieves of the law."" Part of this reality was, again, the Soviet Union system. For example, Greek Catholic believers or a national movement against the Soviet Union. They are the same as Putin in jail. They start to be part of this system. It is fierce. They are criminals. They control part of these jails. Other parts of jails were controlled. During the Soviet Union, political cases and prisoners were put in red jails. Because police officers can prevent this, there are only two kinds of prisons now. Now, the third part of the jails is green, not black or red. Green means Islamic. This means that this is a closed society. It works by Islamic laws. It works through the law of crime. That is new. Before, it did not exist at all in the territory of former Soviet countries.

Jacobsen: It is points at interviews like this where I enjoy them because I have covered such a broad range of subject matter in a little over a decade.

Romantsova: [Laughing].

Jacobsen: Because I put in a lot of time. I have interviewed a lot of members of the ex-Muslim community. There is a whole host of them. A lot of the online secular community, especially, is one place in which they can formally organize, communicate, share arguments, share stories, help others who are getting out of more cases and help them leave religion when religion has taken an extreme form. Not as extreme as Salafi Wahhabi interpretations from Saudi Arabia, but certainly, family and community and national contexts where it is dangerous for them. So, you're talking about the thing in which they find many problems. Not they disagree with you; they agree with you because they see a threat of politicized religion in the way that a lot of people would see politicized Christianity as an issue in North America or in Russia, particularly in the United States and particularly in the Russian Federation. In the context of the Russian Federation, do you think that the xenophobia that you mentioned at the start has some ties to Islamist tendencies in the Russian Federation and concerns of politicized religion, providing some challenge to the leadership in the country? Is this enough of a challenge in the Russian Federation or more of a substantial nuisance to the leadership?

Romantsova: If Russia exists in Chechnya and a few other regions and a few more are more Islamic, Chechnya is more important because Kadyrov showed that the Islamic region in the Russian Federation could be in power. We do not know why. I think we know why, but Putin absolutely did not react as if there was any problem with Kadyrov, Chechnya's leader. It is not police, but special forces. He and his troops terroristically controlled Chechnya. They showed Russia that you can be absolutely Islamic and officially accepted. It is the same situation as the Taliban from Afghanistan. Putin officially meets with them. I think Putin showed that if you organize like an Islamic movement. You can even be strong enough that Putin accepts you as part of the dialogue.

Imports are expected to rise to 19,484 megawatt hours (Mwh), beating the record of 18,649 Mwh at the end of March after the first wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy sector.

""The power system has been experiencing a significant electricity shortage for most of the day,"" national power grid operator Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app.

""The reason for this is large-scale damage to Ukrainian power plants, which means they cannot produce as much electricity as before the attack.""

The ministry said that, with the country facing a significant deficit in the system, it plans to import power from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova on Monday.

The grid operator said that emergency assistance from the European Union had already been provided from midnight to this morning, adding that power curbs for industrial consumers are expected this evening.

""Restricting consumption is a necessary measure to maintain the stability of the power system after the fifth targeted missile attack on power plants this year,"" the operator said.

Last week's combined attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure caused serious damage at three thermal power plants, piling more pressure on the country's power grid.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, dealing significant damage and causing blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have resulted in more than $1 billion of damage to the sector, said Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko.

Thermal and hydropower facilities as well as power transmission systems bore the brunt of the attacks, resulting in the loss of about 80% of Ukraine's thermal power generation capacity and increasing reliance on its three nuclear power plants, which produce about 50% of the country's electricity.",newsmax.com,news,NewsMax,,-0.3098039215686275,453298745,10,https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=2752eadb-ad69-49c9-aac7-0d4fbe22470c&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280,

The person admitted his responsibility and the damaged Mercedes was then transported on a trailer to the gas station in Hovány. Almost five months have passed since then, but the car is still at the mechanic. The reason: they are unable to obtain spare parts to repair the non-fatal damage shown in the pictures, which is expected to cost HUF 4 million to repair, according to the service worksheet.

Rental car for months

According to our reader, when Hovány took delivery of the Mercedes, he was informed that the repair would take about two months. The employee explained this with the insurance administration and the holidays being close to the holidays. It's a strange side story that this type is also made in Kecskemét, so it seems logical that it's easier to get parts for it than for a higher category type. In reality, however, all automobile factories treat the parts required for production and subsequent repairs completely separately.

The owner of the broken Mercedes received a free replacement car from the importer for just three working days. They reasoned that it was not the company's fault that they had to wait for repairs. In mid-February, the service informed me that they were still waiting for parts and that the Mercedes could not be restored. The importer then promised delivery by the end of March or beginning of April. Until the beginning of May, no parts arrived and it is not even possible to say when repairs can begin, and nothing has changed since then. Hovány provided some good news because the company promised on May 9th that it would soon provide a replacement car for the duration of the further waiting period.

Our reader also did not receive a satisfactory answer when asked whether the warranty period for his Mercedes would be extended by the five months in which he was unable to use it. According to János, the dealership responded to this suggestion by saying that there had never been a case in which a car's warranty was extended due to difficulties in purchasing parts. Our reader has been using rental cars since the accident in December, but is disappointed because he previously thought he couldn't be in a similar situation to a Mercedes owner.

There are difficulties in obtaining spare parts

And he is not alone in that. We recently presented the case of Balázs, who had an accident in the driveway of his house on January 16th during a failed parking maneuver with his newly purchased 2020 Mercedes CLS 450 4 Matic. As revealed in our previous article, he had to wait three and a half months for the repair because neither the Hovány brand service in Kecskemét nor the Mercedes importer nor the brand headquarters in Stuttgart could provide the necessary cooling bracket.

The unusually long wait was made more difficult by the fact that the importer's customer service responded to Balázs' question a few weeks ago by saying that the next time they could ask about the missing part was on April 17th. A day after the deadline, the company sent another message saying they could inquire again on May 6th because the console was still missing. In the end, a miracle must have happened for one of the most famous car brands in the world, because the part actually arrived and Balázs got the car back from the service center at the end of April, which had been properly assembled by the mechanics by then.

The entire repair cost of HUF 3 million was originally supposed to be covered by Balázs' car's comprehensive insurance, but he wants the importer to cover HUF 1.4 million of this, as he also covers the CLS leasing fee, insurance and the Company had to pay vehicle tax while waiting. The company has not yet responded to the car owner's question about this. Mercedes-Benz Hungária has previously answered our questions: There are difficulties when purchasing parts, although the frequency of the cases was not explained in more detail.

The case of János and Balázs is actually important not because it shows that sometimes the owners of expensive cars are confronted with fundamental problems, but because the owner of a new or young car is generally right to count the manufacturer, but the importer is further down the line In some cases this is far from the case, and not just at Mercedes, as we have been informed of many similar cases since our last article.

The law does not oblige the manufacturer to deliver

Parts supply problems do not even depend on the modern value of cars, nor are they solely the fault of the manufacturers. Brands buy most parts from supplier companies. If there are problems with inventory management or raw material procurement, this chain can be temporarily disrupted. In some cases, even automobile production may be halted, as we saw during the coronavirus epidemic and in the first phase of the Russo-Ukrainian war, when a number of factors caused a crisis in the automobile industry by disrupting the supply of semiconductors or semiconductors Some of the procurement of electrical cable breakouts came from Ukraine. Since European Union legislation does not in all cases effectively protect the rights of users of cars and other consumer goods, companies settle cases according to their own capabilities and priorities and keep their customers waiting.

According to lawyer Tamás Vágány, who spoke in our previous article, the responsibility of service centers usually extends to the careful approach, that is, ordering the correct parts in a timely manner and then promptly installing them in the car upon arrival. Regarding cases similar to our reader's, the bad news is that there is no law in Hungary that sets a specific deadline for the procurement of spare parts.

The relevant legislation provides only general guidelines, as it states that the repair or replacement must be carried out within a reasonable time, taking into account the characteristics of the thing and the purpose expected by the right holder, while safeguarding the rights holder's interests. In addition, all this does not apply to the repair of Balázs' CLS or János' Mercedes A180, since neither of the two cars was sent to the workshop because of a guarantee or warranty problem, but because they were broken.

Since problems with the supply of spare parts are also common in other EU member states, according to Tamás Vágány, a solution could be a regulation that explicitly obliges car manufacturers to cover the need for spare parts within the expected time or, if this is not the case, to provide reimbursement of costs incurred by owners of cars awaiting repair. According to the lawyer, such a legal solution is not expected in the short term, although there are already European regulations for electronic devices to ensure a permanent supply of spare parts.

Is five months really just two months?

Regarding the János case, we sent questions to Mercedes-Benz Hungária, the Hungarian importer of the brand. According to the company, it is currently not possible to source a front bumper for our reader's A180, therefore repairing the damage will be delayed. At the same time, the importer added that the car did not have an original bumper, but a different model version. By the way, all of this is irrelevant, because according to the damage photos, the front bumper of the more expensive Mercedes A-Class can easily be installed in the standard car and Mercedes should stock this part in the same way as the simpler part for the budget version. János didn't know that the car's previous owner had replaced the A180's bumper.

When we wrote our article, our reader had already been waiting for more than four and a half months for his car to be repaired at the Mercedes service center in Kecskemét. According to the importer, the parts were only ordered from the manufacturer at the end of February due to the insurance company's permission and for other reasons not mentioned in the response letter. Our reader's position is that the company has been waiting in this regard not since mid-December, but a little over two months. In his letter, the importer emphasized that he was treating the case as a priority, but added that János had only submitted his complaint to Mercedes' central customer service two days before Telex contacted him.

In this regard, our reader says: He would like to know why the service did not immediately order the parts necessary for the repair when the car was delivered to the service. He also sent us the report on the additional insurance check that he received from the Hovány service on March 8, although the letter initially ended up in spam and he only noticed it later. According to the additional inspection report, the right front shock absorber of the car also needs to be replaced, and the insurance company overpriced this part by 10 percent, so they will reimburse a slightly lower amount than the new price, but the energy-absorbing insert and the cross members also need to be replaced, among other things become.

If János had chosen a Mercedes of the same type and equipment from a car rental company instead of his broken car, he would have spent hundreds of thousands of forints on the car rental by now, while at the same time he would also have to pay his own electricity bills during downtime. In principle, these costs can also be covered by comprehensive insurance, but this largely depends on the regulations contained in the contract. According to the lawyer interviewed, companies usually only cover the innocent victim's replacement car costs for a short period of time, as they only see three or four days as the optimal repair time, which is difficult to interpret legally and customers often accept this.",newsbeezer.com,news,newsbeezer.com,,-0.05882352941176472,453295310,1,,

May 13 (Interfax) - Due to electricity shortage persisting for most of the day, restrictions on electricity consumption for industry are being reimposed after the weekend break, and they will be in effect from 5:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m., Ukrainian media reported, citing Ukrenergo as saying on social media.

A record May import from the five European countries, namely, Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Moldova totaling 19,484 MWh (almost 7,000 MWh on Sunday) is scheduled for Monday, it said.

Additionally, emergency aid from the EU countries was already provided on Monday from 12:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. The emergency aid is also expected to be involved during the evening peak hours, the media reported, citing the Energy Ministry.

On Sunday, in particular, the aid was also provided from 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. and from 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. from the power grids in Romania, Poland, and Slovakia. The total emergency aid accounted for less than 2% of daily consumption (it was around 3% on Saturday and 1% on Friday), the ministry said.

At the same time, the Ukrainian power grid accepted surplus electricity from Poland on Sunday from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. at the Polish energy system operator's request, Ukrenergo said.

At the same time, the transmission system operator restricted the electricity production from renewable energy sources during daytime hours in the southern regions to prevent overloading the equipment at a high-voltage substation, the ministry added.

The system operator draws attention to the fact that as of Monday morning, consumption rose 6.7% at once compared to the same time on the previous workday, Friday, May 10.

Consumers are asked to use electricity sparingly, especially from 5:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m.

Imports are expected to rise to 19,484 megawatt hours (Mwh), beating the record of 18,649 Mwh at the end of March after the first wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy sector.

""The power system has been experiencing a significant electricity shortage for most of the day,"" national power grid operator Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app.

""The reason for this is large-scale damage to Ukrainian power plants, which means they cannot produce as much electricity as before the attack.""

The ministry said that, with the country facing a significant deficit in the system, it plans to import power from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova on Monday.

The grid operator said that emergency assistance from the European Union had already been provided from midnight to this morning, adding that power curbs for industrial consumers are expected this evening.

""Restricting consumption is a necessary measure to maintain the stability of the power system after the fifth targeted missile attack on power plants this year,"" the operator said.

Last week's combined attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure caused serious damage at three thermal power plants, piling more pressure on the country's power grid.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, dealing significant damage and causing blackouts in many regions.

The attacks have resulted in more than $1 billion of damage to the sector, said Ukrainian energy minister German Galushchenko.

MOL Group generated USD 402 mn simplified free cash flow in Q1 2024, 22% lower compared to the same period of last year.

Chairman-CEO Zsolt Hernádi commented on the results: ""MOL Group's financial results once again demonstrated the effectiveness of our resilient business model. While coping with the challenges of the external environment, we were able to deliver solid results. Our stability is key to strengthen Central- and Eastern Europe's security of supply and delivery of strategic investments, like the soon-to-be-inaugurated EUR 1.3 bn polyol complex. In March, we outlined an ambitious investment agenda in our updated strategy to increase the competitiveness of MOL as well as the industry in CEE. Despite the extra heavy government levies weighed on our performance, we remain committed to continue our energy transition journey and develop our self-sufficiency further on.""

Downstream results were supported by both petchem and refining margins but lower sales of own production weighed on performance. Extra government take in Hungary continues to impact results with the revenue based tax, Brent Ural tax, and CO2 tax all having a considerable effect on quarterly results.

Consumer Services marked a continuing improvement in non-fuel margin, meaning mostly expanding gastro, grocery, and non-food sales, while one-off gains on remedy sales of fuel stations also contributed to Q1 results. Despite a decrease in network size due to remedy handovers in Hungary, fuel sales volume increased by 6% year-on-year, while unit fuel margin dropped by 2% year-on-year. The number of Fresh Corner sites rose throughout the network to 1,260 in Q1 2024, from 1,172 in Q1 2023.

Upstream production totalled 92.3 mboepd in the first quarter of 2024, which means 0,8 mboepd increase quarter-on-quarter. As first gas was reached in Kazakhstan in December 2023, it resulted +1.3 mboepd in Q1 2024. CEE production levels have decreased slightly due to baseline decline in onshore assets in Croatia, while production in Hungary was retained at high levels thanks to successful efforts to counter natural decline. Group-level unit cost remained unchanged year-on-year despite general inflationary pressures, due to decreasing electricity prices, higher production, and composition shifting towards lower-cost assets.

Circular Economy Services was affected by lower than expected Extended Producers Responsibilty (EPR) revenue realization. The Deposit and Refund System (DRS) is in operation since 1 January with ca. 2,400 Reverse Vending Machines installed and available at retail sites all around Hungary.

Based on their data, Chile generated the largest share of electricity from solar power last year, with 19.9 percent, followed by Greece with 19 percent, and Hungary came third globally, with 18.4 percent. In the top ten, our country is ahead of the Netherlands, Australia, Spain and Germany, among others, the Energy Ministry stressed in a statement.

According to the ministry's statement, the sensational result is mainly due to the huge solar energy capacities built in Hungary in recent years. The expansion rate has reached a record in two consecutive years, with around 1,100 megawatts in 2022 and more than 1,600 megawatts last year. In February of this year, the total installed capacity of solar panels regularly exceeded the 6,000 megawatts previously targeted for 2030.

The revised National Energy and Climate Plan therefore predicts twice as much capacity by the beginning of the next decade. Based on known development needs, the expectation of 12,000 megawatts is very safely achievable.

The government is supporting the production and storage of clean, climate-friendly energy with a total of HUF 200 billion (EUR 515.6 million) in ongoing programs. Families can buy modern solar systems with energy storage through the Solar Energy Plus Program. So far, more than 8,800 applicants have been awarded a total of HUF 36 billion (EUR 92.8 million), an average of HUF 4 million (EUR 10,313) per property.

Another call for proposals, announced in April, could result in the installation of around half a hundred industrial energy storage systems in Hungary by spring 2026.

Pumped-storage plants are used in many countries to control the natural fluctuations in the output of weather-dependent renewables and are by far the most efficient way of storing energy today. In Hungary, a feasibility study is being carried out for the first time this year on the energy justification for this investment.

In recent years, under the strategic guidance of the leaders of both countries, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been aligned with Hungary's ""Opening to the East"" policy, resulting in fruitful cooperation across various sectors.

Significant achievements have been made in green development areas such as new energy vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and photovoltaic products, injecting new impetus into the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Hungary.

The automotive industry is one of the pillars of Hungary's economy. More than 10 out of the top 20 global automobile manufacturers have established vehicle manufacturing plants or automotive component production bases in Hungary.

To embrace green transformation in the transportation sector, the Hungarian government launched an electric vehicle development plan in 2016. Chinese electric vehicle companies have been closely cooperating with Hungarian counterparts, and their brand recognition has been continuously increasing.

In April 2017, an electric bus factory of Chinese new energy vehicle manufacturer BYD in north Hungary's Komarom officially started production. It is BYD's first electric vehicle factory established in Europe.

In September 2022, Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO's first overseas factory was put into use in Biatorbagy, Hungary. The factory serves as NIO's manufacturing, service, and research center for charging products in Europe, providing local consumers with battery swapping stations.

In January this year, BYD set up a new energy vehicle production base in Hungary's Szeged, which is the sixth Chinese automotive manufacturing plant in Hungary and is expected to offer thousands of job opportunities.

""Hungary has a mature industrial chain for automotive manufacturing. While leveraging Hungary's advantages in the industry, we are bringing advanced manufacturing techniques and highly automated production lines to the Hungarian market from China, so as to support the electrification of the Hungarian automotive industry and promote technological exchange and innovation between China and Hungary,"" said an executive from BYD.

Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said that the automotive manufacturing sector is a pillar industry in Hungary, and attracting Chinese investment is crucial for strengthening Hungary's position in global new energy vehicle development.

Power batteries are key components of new energy vehicles, accounting for approximately 40 percent of the total vehicle cost. With advantages such as fast charging, long range, and high safety, Chinese lithium-ion batteries have become an important aspect of China-Hungary cooperation in the field of new energy.

In March 2022, Chinese lithium-ion battery company EVE Energy Co., Ltd. (EVE) announced a plan to build a factory in Debrecen, Hungary to produce cylindrical cells.

Five months later, Chinese battery manufacturer and technology company CATL also announced to build a battery plant in the city, which will become one of the largest battery factories in Europe once completed.

Additionally, other Chinese power battery companies and related material enterprises, such as SEMCORP, Huayou Cobalt, and Sunwoda, have also started building factories in Hungary.

The investment of Chinese battery companies like CATL in Hungary has stimulated the development of the Hungarian battery industry, and factories built by Chinese carmakers including BYD in Hungary have also promoted the development of the local automotive industry, said Andrea Nagyne Boda, head of the International Cooperation and Development Finance Department at the Ministry for National Economy of Hungary.

Hungary-China cooperation projects not only benefit the Hungarian people but also contribute to the entire Europe's enjoyment of the benefits of new energy, Andrea added.

Hungary's electricity import stands at around 30 percent. In order to diversify the country's energy supply, the Hungarian government has been actively exploring solar energy resources and developing the photovoltaic industry.

In June 2019, China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) under China General Technology (Group) Holding Co., Ltd., invested in a 100 MW solar park in Kaposvar, Hungary, which is one of the largest renewable energy facilities in Hungary.

Since its operation in 2021, the solar farm has generated over 140 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, which is equivalent to saving 45,000 tons of standard coal and reducing 120,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions on an annual basis.

CMC implemented a series of environmentally friendly measures when the solar farm was constructed. For instance, it replaced impact piles with spiral pile photovoltaic brackets to minimize land damage. It hired landscape experts for ecological planning and conducted large-scale greening around the factory area.

Kaposvar's mayor Karoly Szita said that the Kaposvar solar farm is not only an exemplary collaboration in clean energy between Hungary and China but also a testament to the friendship between the two countries.

""Green transformation is a global trend, and the development of new energy is crucial for restructuring global energy supply. China has provided us with excellent opportunities in this field, and the deepening of green cooperation between our two countries has achieved mutual benefits and win-win outcomes,"" said Marton Bokay, deputy state secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of Economic Development.",en.people.cn,news,"People's Daily, China",,0.1607843137254903,453278623,85,,eng-9563111

This carbon saving rises to over 60% when renewable electricity is used. Producing Europe's demand for battery cells and components locally would save an estimated 133 Mt of CO2 between 2024 and 2030, equivalent to the total annual emissions of Czechia.

But less than half (47%) of the lithium-ion battery production planned for Europe up to 2030 is secure, the report also finds. This is up from one-third a year ago following a raft of measures put in place to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act. The remaining 53% of announced cell manufacturing capacity is still at medium or high risk of being delayed, scaled down or cancelled without stronger government action.

Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and emobility supply chains at T&E, said: ""Batteries, and metals that go into them, are the new oil. European leaders will need laser sharp focus and joined-up thinking to reap their climate and industrial benefits. Strong sustainability requirements, such as the upcoming battery carbon footprint rules, can reward local clean manufacturing.

France, Germany and Hungary have made the most progress in securing gigafactory capacity since T&E's previous risk assessment last year.

Finland, the UK, Norway and Spain have the most production capacity at medium or high risk due to question marks over projects by the Finnish Minerals Group, West Midlands Gigafactory, Freyr and InoBat.

With me this morning are Gilad Yavetz, CEO and Co-founder of Enlight, Nir Yehuda, CFO of Enlight, Jason Ellsworth, CEO and Co-founder of Clenera and Adam Pishl, COO and Co-founder of Clenera. Gilad will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Jason and Adam for a review of our U.S. activity, and then to Nir for a review of our first quarter results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.

Gilad Yavetz: Thank you, Yosef and thank you all for joining us today. Enlight is off to a strong start to the year and we are pleased to present a robust set of financial results for the first quarter. Revenue grew 27% year over year to $90 million, while Adjusted EBITDA grew 28% year over year to $68 million in the quarter. We benefited during the quarter from high production levels across our 1.9 GW operational portfolio, particularly at some of our largest wind farms. Net income was $24 million versus $33 million last year which benefitted from one-off financing income we recognized post-IPO last year which Nir will explain in more detail later on. On the back of these results, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year 2024 guidance. In addition to the strong financial results, we continued to execute on our project portfolio during the quarter. Our projects are proceeding on schedule, including the 579 MW and 1.7 GWh expected to reach COD this year, as well as the 1.1 GW and 2.9 GWh of new projects we expect to start construction this year. Enlight is on the cusp of a major expansion which will ultimately result in the tripling of the company's generation and storage capacity to 5.1 GW and 5.7 GWh by 2026. We are laser focused on the execution and delivery of our plan. Let me describe what we are seeing in the United States, where the industry fundamental backdrop is one of the best we have ever seen. First off, demand for electricity is increasing. For most of the past decade, forecasts for long-term annual U.S. load growth stood at approximately 0.5% per year. But this accelerated in 2023, when forecasts for long term demand nearly doubled to 0.9% a year until 2028. This represents an additional 38 GW of peak demand over the next five years. To put that in perspective, that is the equivalent of 75% of California's peak load today. This rapid acceleration in demand has been driven by the re-shoring of manufacturing, EVs and most importantly the installation of data centers which consume an immense quantum of power and there is a strong possibility that this does not capture the true demand picture which could rise up to 1.5% annual growth until the end of this decade. This also explains why PPA pricing remains high, even as equipment prices have been falling. Enlight is uniquely positioned for this tight power market environment, with a broad set of projects that are deliverable in the short-to-medium term. These projects include Atrisco, our 364 MW and 1.2 GWh flagship project located in New Mexico which will see completion of its solar component during the third quarter of this year, while the storage part is on track for COD during the fourth quarter, both as planned. Moreover, Quail Ranch, Roadrunner and Country Acres, the 3 major projects we expect to start construction in the United States in 2024 totaling 810 MW and 2.0 GWh, have completed all critical development milestones and are on schedule. We will soon initiate major procurement for these projects. Equipment pricing remains beneficial to us, with panel prices around $0.25. All-in battery prices are now $170. Both these elements have fallen by 30% to 35% from the start of 2023. All these factors combined contribute to improving unlevered returns on the projects that we are planning to build between now and 2026. These stand at 10.5%, an improvement of 50 bps since last quarter and with addition of financing, reach mid- to high-teens levels on the levered equity return. In Europe, while short-term power prices have been unusually low, long-term power prices remain high, reflecting attractive returns for Enlight's operational and development portfolio as we continue to secure important milestones at our near-term projects. We reached financial close for our 94 MW wind farm, Project Pupin in Serbia, arranging a $95 million financing package from EBRD and Erste, the same partners who financed our operational Blacksmith project which is adjacent to Pupin. Pupin which has a signed 15-year CFD agreement at €69 per MWh, is now under construction and is expected to reach COD as planned in the second half of 2025. In addition, we reached financial close on two of our smaller Hungarian projects, recovering $29 million of excess equity invested. The normalization of European energy prices and the prevailing higher cost of capital are sparking a greater flow of attractive later stage project acquisition opportunities across the continent. We are currently evaluating several project acquisitions and we may seek to take advantage of this opportunistic window. In Israel, we continue to engage with the newly deregulated power sector, enhancing our ability to generate and sell electricity to different segments of our home market. Arad Valley 3, a part of the Israel Solar & Storage cluster, reached COD during the first quarter, as we maintain the rollout of this project cluster through 2024. We also signed PPAs with 2 additional companies for 50 MW of supply, as we further expand our reach into Israel's corporate power market. Finally, we announced the formation of a new subsidiary named Enlight Local, led by one of the top management teams in Israel which will address the power needs of Israeli municipalities and agricultural customers by building distributed power infrastructure. Finally, turning to our operational portfolio, electricity generation volumes at most of our wind farms were well above expectations, including at Gecama in Spain, Blacksmith in Serbia and Genesis Wind in Israel. This was partly offset by weaker merchant pricing, especially at Gecama, where low electricity prices were recorded during the quarter. Despite these merchant market conditions, our hedging strategy provided significant downside protection, as we hedged 65% of Gecama's anticipated production at a high price of €100 for 2024. As we show in the slide deck accompanying this quarter's results, even in an extreme case where merchant prices for the rest of 2024 end up 50% below the internal forecasts we made at the start of the year, our corporate adjusted EBITDA would only drop by 2% from the midpoint of our guidance range. I would like to emphasize that we do not expect lower merchant prices to impact our Financial Outlook for 2024. Moreover, we are also looking to adapt our commercial strategy to current conditions. After the extraordinary returns that we have made at Gecama, where heavy merchant market exposure over the past two years has returned half of the equity we invested in the project, we are now considering options of entering into a long term PPA. To sum up, this quarter showed strong financial performance and we continue to be on schedule in meeting our COD and project development goals. Business fundamentals in the US are very supportive for our planned expansion there, with rising power demand and low equipment costs translating into higher PPA pricing and increasing project returns. It is exactly these trends that enable Enlight to achieve its dual goal of delivering higher-than-market growth at higher-than market returns. I'd now like to hand the call over to Jason.

Jason Ellsworth: Thank you Gilad, Enlight and Clenera are rapidly expanding in the U.S. and we are laser focused on construction and project finance. In total, we plan to be in active construction on more than 1.2 GW of solar and 3.2 GWh of battery during 2024. Our 364 MW and 1.2 GWh Atrisco project in New Mexico is on schedule. We expect to reach COD on the solar in the third quarter. The solar project has already reached mechanical completion and commissioning work is underway. The battery is expected to be complete during the fourth quarter; equipment is almost all on site and work is underway to connect the initial circuits. Looking beyond Atrisco, we plan to begin construction on Country Acres, Quail Ranch and Roadrunner in the second half. These projects together total 810 MW of generation and over 2 GWh of energy storage. The 392 MW and 688 MWh Country Acres project in California is expected to begin first. All regulatory and permitting hurdles are clear and construction contracts are nearly complete. Quail Ranch is not far behind. The 128 MW and 400 MWh project in New Mexico is ready to start construction but awaiting PPA regulatory approval. Finally, the 290 MW and 940 MWh Roadrunner project in Arizona is completing its remaining governmental approvals. Before year end, we expect all three of these projects to enter construction. Each is an important part of delivering our 2026 objectives. Our CO Bar project in Arizona is comprised of 3 busbar PPAs totaling approximately 1.2 GW and 824 MWh and contracted with APS and SRP. The APS queue reform is ongoing and is still on track to support a year-end 2026 COD for the vast majority of the project, with the remainder to follow in early 2027. We continue to engage with APS to advance the interconnection work as quickly as possible. As a reminder, another 3.2 GWh of battery potential is under development at the site but not yet contracted. Taking a step back, we continue to see strong support for our project fundamentals. PPA pricing remains sticky, in light of the trends Gilad mentioned earlier. Equipment prices have also declined, with cost for both solar panels and batteries falling in the past year. Since the beginning of 2023 both solar module and battery pricing have dropped by approximately 30% to 35%. This has served to offset the increase in financing costs and deliver improved returns. Turning to supply chain, there is currently renewed concern regarding possible trade sanctions aimed at Asian equipment producers. Clenera uses modules supplied from SE Asia and India that are audited by third parties to ensure compliance with today's UFLPA and AD/CVD rules. Our suppliers have proven ability to work efficiently and successfully through routine customs investigations and deliver on time. If additional sanctions emerge, Clenera has supply contingency plans in place to limit potential sanction impact, including use of U.S. assembled bifacial panels and batteries. On a final note, Adam will lead the company's US commentary next quarter. I'm excited to see the organization grow and develop under his exceptional leadership. I'd now like to turn the call over to Nir for a review of our quarterly results.

Nir Yehuda: Thank you, Jason. In the first quarter of 2024, the company's revenues increased to $90 million, up from $71 million last year, a growth rate of 27% year over year. Growth was mainly driven by new operational projects compared to last year, while being offset by a decline in revenues caused by much lower electricity prices in Spain relative to the prices observed in the same quarter last year. Since the first quarter of last year, 10 new projects in the US, Hungary and Israel started selling electricity. The most important of these is Genesis Wind which contributed $9 million to revenue. In addition, Bjornberget which barely sold power at the start of 2023, contributed $7 million in this quarter. Gecama generated approximately $20 million in revenues; however, its contribution fell 6% year over year due to much lower Spanish power prices compared to Q1 '23. We sold power in Spain at an overall average price of €65 per MWh this quarter versus €85 per MWh in the same period last year. The decline in pricing was offset by very high production volumes which were 20% higher than last year, as well as the results of our hedging strategy which allowed us to sell 52% of Gecama's production at a price of €98 per MWh. In Israel, 7 of the 12 Solar plus storage cluster units are now in operation contributing $3 million, while none were selling electricity in the same period last year. Finally, the reclassification of financial asset projects in Israel to fixed asset projects boosted revenues by $3 million, though at the same time, we moved the sum from the financial income line. Fourth quarter net income has declined by 26% to $24 million from $33 million last year due to unusually high finance income in 2023. In the first quarter of last year, we recorded a one-off $12 million benefit caused by the depreciation of the Israeli Shekel on the large amount of cash the company had received following completion of our NASDAQ IPO in February 2023. In addition, we recorded a $2 million non-cash gain in Q1 '24 stemming from the mark-to-market of interest rate hedges and a positive revaluation of foreign exchange-denominated liabilities. Cash flow from operations declined by 36% to $35 million from $55 million last year influenced by working capital. In the first quarter of '24, the company's adjusted EBITDA grew by 28% to $68 million compared to $54 million for the same period in 2023. On the whole adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by the same positive factors which affected our revenue growth. Looking to our balance sheet, Enlight achieved 2 financial closings for projects in Central Europe. We raised a $95 million loan for the construction of the Pupin wind project in Serbia and a $42 million financing facility for the construction of the Tapolca solar project in Hungary. We also recycled $29 million of excess capital back to Enlight as a result of this transaction. In addition, Enlight has $325 million of revolving credit facilities at Israeli and international banks as of the balance sheet date, none of which have been drawn. This is $65 million above what we reported in our Q4 '23 results. Moving to 2024 guidance, given the strong set of results we delivered for the first quarter, we reaffirm our financial outlook for the year, expecting annual revenue between $335 to $360 million and with adjusted EBITDA between $235 million and $255 million. In addition, 90% of 2024 generation output will be sold at fixed prices either through hedges or PPAs. Our guidance reflects annual growth of 36% and 30% at the midpoint compared to 2023 respectively, demonstrating our accelerated growth path in 2024 and the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Clare with ROTH MKM.

Justin Clare: Hi, everyone. First off, I just wanted to start on module supply. I was wondering, since the announcement of the latest AD/CVD case that's targeting Southeast Asian countries, can you talk about whether you're seeing any change in the market so far? You mentioned pricing is down to $0.25 a watt. Are you seeing that change? Are you seeing it move higher at this point? And then if tariffs were placed on both cells and modules from Southeast Asia, can you just talk about your ability to access supply and whether you see any potential for disruption to your product time lines?

Jason Ellsworth: Certainly on our mind, something we've been spending a good amount of time on as we work through details related to supply chain. So specifically, we're seeing the market remain fairly stable in terms of supply and pricing. There is some shuffling going on and certainly, some of that shuffling is an increased emphasis on investment in the U.S. and acceleration on those investments by producers who are looking to increase U.S. content as the demand is there and there's likely need for that in the future. In the meantime, we're seeing a mix in terms of our supply chain that is manageable given the outcomes, especially given our emphasis on non-targeted Southeast Asia supply. That said, we also have a solid set of relationships and work related to supply out of the U.S. that would allow us to size-step eventual issues. With some cost impact but it's a manageable amount of cost impact, a few pennies of cost impact to us and then to the projects. Of course, the benefit there is additional opportunity related to domestic content and the upside related to domestic content if that shift occurs. So we see this in large part, a neutral topic in the near term and potentially in the longer term, accelerating the shift to domestic supply that will, in fact, benefit the projects.

Gilad Yavetz: I will add 2 short points to that. First, in general, we still see a positive trend in terms of the panels pricing. So, we see them still going down and then offsetting some of the other elements and it's worth to mention the strategic step we did last year with Waaree, the Indian supplier and the MSA that we have with this supplier that allows us very good responsiveness to the AD/CVD future steps that will be taken. So we have a good source that we believe will be available.

Justin Clare: Just to follow on that with the domestic content adder, can you talk about the timing potential in which you think you could secure that out on the solar side of the business but then also for storage projects as well. I am curious what the time frame might be?

Gilad Yavetz: We are aligning some of our projects in order to get more from the domestic content, especially in projects where the tax equity path will be ITC, then we see a strong benefit for that. For example, Rustic Hills and we believe that for '27, we will be on track to get the adder on that.

Justin Clare: We've seen obviously a very strong increase in demand for electricity from data centers, wondering if you're looking to participate in RFPs that are being done from data centers and whether or not those might incorporate solar and storage?

Gilad Yavetz: I think it's a great question. We see a very positive environment for us right now that is being created in the U.S. because of the data center growth that leads to this increase in electricity demand primarily and also opens up a lot of opportunities for us also in the business model. So it's not only participating in PPAs, we are reviewing and exploring other business development and even M&A options that are related to this trend which we believe that will be long term.

Jason Ellsworth: In the West which is obviously power constrained and with big data center builds over the next decade, that is contracted via the utility. So the utility will leave the corporate demand through a PPA direct with the utility. So we won't see it in an RFP with the data center providers directly. We'll see it with increased demand from the utilities and just given the interconnection positions we hold in the West, we think that puts us in a really position to deliver in the near term for those data center clients which is a huge value to them.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi from Mizuho.

Maheep Mandloi: Just on the module procurement, can you talk about the sourcing. You talked about Waaree being one of the word big ones, are you looking solar cells from them or potentially modules from their potential expansion in the U.S.? Or do you have any other suppliers lined up for that as well?

Jason Ellsworth: Our relationship with Waaree includes solar cells and Waaree is a producer of solar cells. Their produced solar cells are part of our sourcing plan with them and our contractual relationship. We're continuing to look at the advent and introduction of solar cells in the U.S. and that's a longer-term equation, i.e. 2027 time frame for projects and domestic content that Gilad was referencing. We're targeting that time frame to be careful, though, we're, of course, open to and working on accelerating as much as possible as it relates to other projects and opportunities that might pull us in a little earlier than that but 2027 is really the reasonable time frame that we're looking at to include U.S. sales.

Maheep Mandloi: You kind of talked about everything seems the target on track but curious on your thoughts on how should we think about going forward? Do you expect any bottlenecks over here on a run rate basis, either from EPC constraints or transformer switchgear constraints. For the market, then we're obviously hearing from some of the suppliers that projects are getting pushed out. But just curious, why you're not seeing that right now? And what are your expectations for that going forward?

Gilad Yavetz: This is a great question. I think that we are very confident right now on the operational track, First on Atrisco, that is a major project for us and we plan the COD of both the solar side and the battery side before the end of '24 and we are at least on track. I believe that we took a very important operational and procurement decisions that will also support construction on time of the new projects that we are going to build in the U.S. in '24, including decision for transformers that we did and other elements that can be bottlenecked. So we feel quite confident right now on our plans.

Jason Ellsworth: If I may add to Gilad's point, I think all those projects have signed interconnection agreements, signed PPAs, real estate and for the large part, all their permits. So that gives us a large degree of comfort on the milestones that these projects have achieved that were on plan, if not ahead.

Maheep Mandloi: Then maybe just one last one on merchant pricing in Spain, the table in the press release is pretty useful to understand the sensitivity. The spot prices in Spain are almost around €30 right now per MWh, almost 50% below your assumption of 68.5% that imply like EBITDA could be 2% below the midpoint for the rest of the year.

Gilad Yavetz: The current price today may be €30 but if you look at the forwards for the remainder of the year, they're in the 70% range, if not higher. So there's been kind of a short-term decline in power prices which we've seen in February and mostly in March which has been driven by strong hydro and a lot of wind and solar resource. The hydro was expected to come off which is why you see the near-term future is at the 70% range, July, August, September and so on and so forth. So the 30 is maybe today's price but it's not the expectation of price in the market for the remainder of the year. I would add to that is that the point we are making in the presentation is our resilience to even a short-term downturn in the spot prices in Spain and the point that we just have shown is that even in a reduction of 50% in the merchant prices, we don't see any impact on the EBITDA. The opposite, what we see is positive results in other projects. So, we do not see any reason why to reduce our guidelines, maybe to the opposite but we will consider that next quarter. On the long term, we see also in Spain, very good forecast and forward for the electricity prices, including PPAs. So, the fact that we get offers right now for 10 years PPA on a high basis provide us a lot of confidence that we can either remain in the merchant profile where we have benefited a lot in the last 2 years and basically being able to withdraw more than 50% of the equity of the project. We had a very good up in the last 2 years and what we see currently forward for the next 10 years is good levels of prices and also flexibility to sign long-term PPA at high levels that represent higher returns than the original model. So, I think that we stand there with very good situation. In Spain, I think this was the goal of showing that table on the filter.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ).

Michael Fairbanks: This is Michael Fairbanks on for Mark Strauss. For the U.S. development pipeline, how are you feeling about the availability of tax equity, particularly on the PTC (NASDAQ: PTC ) side. We've heard some tightness there. So just wondering, if you're seeing that and to what extent can you use transferability to offset that?

Gilad Yavetz: I think the profile of our offtake rest of the fundamentals but primarily offtake of our project in the West is very attractive to tax equity providers because we have long-term busbar PPAs for 20 and in some projects, 30 years with a very solid profile. So as produced, we don't have any exposure to curtailment as opposed to have set of PPAs that you can find in other areas. So this leads to a very strong demand that we are getting for tax equity for the project. So we feel less the bottlenecks right now and I think that this is one of the advantages of the portfolio that we see right now in [indiscernible] and specifically with the project online right now.

Jason Ellsworth: There's also the optionality that transferability has provided to do the hybrid structures which is around the tax equity provider syndicating the credits to corporate clients of theirs which have tax exposure and then retaining the interest for the purposes of monetizing the depreciation. So, there's plenty of demand. It's just a matter of exactly the structure that works best for us.

Michael Fairbanks: Any update you guys have on the overall ramp-up at the Genesis the wind projects since the last call?

Gilad Yavetz: It's on plan and even better than planned. We see improved performance of both plants and also we are getting to continuous arrangement with the supplier in the past. So, we feel very good there.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Paz with Wolfe Research.

David Paz: I wanted to just circle back on the PJM portfolio that you touched on it. If you could maybe at a high level talk about your plans in that market and in particular, all the demand that of course, we're seeing from data centers and so forth. Do you anticipate, as part of your farm-down strategy, I think it was 30% or so on going forward, just one of those kind of portfolios that we should look at, what kind of interest are you seeing and are you particularly looking at breaking it down pieces or that you mentioned on your one of your earlier comments on M&A, just maybe overall, just address your PJM strategy.

Gilad Yavetz: First, to begin with, we continue to advance the PJM portfolio. It has advanced well. We have more than 5 projects there but with 5 projects, we are on fast track and with network operate cost of less than $5 million per project which I think is a fantastic for PJM. I understand that on the fast track, Enlight holds 40% of the project right now that are on the fast track on PJM. I think it is amazing. Then, to your question, yes, we believe that PJM is a potential for our strategy on the sell down. There are some elements in PJM were, [indiscernible] project is good. Options for doing this kind of equity recycle we mentioned in previous quarter when the project finally completely matures and get to their optimal value, we believe that the high PPA prices in PJM derived by the data centers demand and multiple players that are interested in projects there may create a very high upside for us in this market.

David Paz: Just on your unlevered return target for your '24 to '26 portfolio, obviously, that was great to see a 50 basis point improvement. How locked in from here, are those returns? Do you anticipate more movement, just with those set of projects on your returns or if you walked in the pricing and so forth that we should probably kind of think of that in a steady state?

Jason Ellsworth: PPAs are signed for over 90% of that block. So the revenue side, obviously, we feel great degree of confidence. On the cost side, we're naturally going to procurement in a significant way and on everything, we're going to obviously start building this year. So we're in advanced negotiations on procurement decisions. For example, on the 3 big projects in the U.S. that we're going to commence construction this year, naturally we have the Atrisco project where procurement is obviously all done and that's locked in. Yes, we feel pretty good. I think the CO Bar which is obviously a big project which we hope to make some procurement decisions by the end of this year, early next.

Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session and I will now turn the call back over to Yosef for closing remarks.

Yosef Lefkovitz: Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone for joining today. We will be at the JPMorgan Energy Conference in New York, as well as ROTH Sustainability Conference in London, and we look forward to catching you up there.

With me this morning are Gilad Yavetz, CEO and Co-founder of Enlight, Nir Yehuda, CFO of Enlight, Jason Ellsworth, CEO and Co-founder of Clenera and Adam Pishl, COO and Co-founder of Clenera. Gilad will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Jason and Adam for a review of our U.S. activity, and then to Nir for a review of our first quarter results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.

Gilad Yavetz: Thank you, Yosef and thank you all for joining us today. Enlight is off to a strong start to the year and we are pleased to present a robust set of financial results for the first quarter. Revenue grew 27% year over year to $90 million, while Adjusted EBITDA grew 28% year over year to $68 million in the quarter. We benefited during the quarter from high production levels across our 1.9 GW operational portfolio, particularly at some of our largest wind farms. Net income was $24 million versus $33 million last year which benefitted from one-off financing income we recognized post-IPO last year which Nir will explain in more detail later on. On the back of these results, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year 2024 guidance. In addition to the strong financial results, we continued to execute on our project portfolio during the quarter. Our projects are proceeding on schedule, including the 579 MW and 1.7 GWh expected to reach COD this year, as well as the 1.1 GW and 2.9 GWh of new projects we expect to start construction this year. Enlight is on the cusp of a major expansion which will ultimately result in the tripling of the company's generation and storage capacity to 5.1 GW and 5.7 GWh by 2026. We are laser focused on the execution and delivery of our plan. Let me describe what we are seeing in the United States, where the industry fundamental backdrop is one of the best we have ever seen. First off, demand for electricity is increasing. For most of the past decade, forecasts for long-term annual U.S. load growth stood at approximately 0.5% per year. But this accelerated in 2023, when forecasts for long term demand nearly doubled to 0.9% a year until 2028. This represents an additional 38 GW of peak demand over the next five years. To put that in perspective, that is the equivalent of 75% of California's peak load today. This rapid acceleration in demand has been driven by the re-shoring of manufacturing, EVs and most importantly the installation of data centers which consume an immense quantum of power and there is a strong possibility that this does not capture the true demand picture which could rise up to 1.5% annual growth until the end of this decade. This also explains why PPA pricing remains high, even as equipment prices have been falling. Enlight is uniquely positioned for this tight power market environment, with a broad set of projects that are deliverable in the short-to-medium term. These projects include Atrisco, our 364 MW and 1.2 GWh flagship project located in New Mexico which will see completion of its solar component during the third quarter of this year, while the storage part is on track for COD during the fourth quarter, both as planned. Moreover, Quail Ranch, Roadrunner and Country Acres, the 3 major projects we expect to start construction in the United States in 2024 totaling 810 MW and 2.0 GWh, have completed all critical development milestones and are on schedule. We will soon initiate major procurement for these projects. Equipment pricing remains beneficial to us, with panel prices around $0.25. All-in battery prices are now $170. Both these elements have fallen by 30% to 35% from the start of 2023. All these factors combined contribute to improving unlevered returns on the projects that we are planning to build between now and 2026. These stand at 10.5%, an improvement of 50 bps since last quarter and with addition of financing, reach mid- to high-teens levels on the levered equity return. In Europe, while short-term power prices have been unusually low, long-term power prices remain high, reflecting attractive returns for Enlight's operational and development portfolio as we continue to secure important milestones at our near-term projects. We reached financial close for our 94 MW wind farm, Project Pupin in Serbia, arranging a $95 million financing package from EBRD and Erste, the same partners who financed our operational Blacksmith project which is adjacent to Pupin. Pupin which has a signed 15-year CFD agreement at €69 per MWh, is now under construction and is expected to reach COD as planned in the second half of 2025. In addition, we reached financial close on two of our smaller Hungarian projects, recovering $29 million of excess equity invested. The normalization of European energy prices and the prevailing higher cost of capital are sparking a greater flow of attractive later stage project acquisition opportunities across the continent. We are currently evaluating several project acquisitions and we may seek to take advantage of this opportunistic window. In Israel, we continue to engage with the newly deregulated power sector, enhancing our ability to generate and sell electricity to different segments of our home market. Arad Valley 3, a part of the Israel Solar & Storage cluster, reached COD during the first quarter, as we maintain the rollout of this project cluster through 2024. We also signed PPAs with 2 additional companies for 50 MW of supply, as we further expand our reach into Israel's corporate power market. Finally, we announced the formation of a new subsidiary named Enlight Local, led by one of the top management teams in Israel which will address the power needs of Israeli municipalities and agricultural customers by building distributed power infrastructure. Finally, turning to our operational portfolio, electricity generation volumes at most of our wind farms were well above expectations, including at Gecama in Spain, Blacksmith in Serbia and Genesis Wind in Israel. This was partly offset by weaker merchant pricing, especially at Gecama, where low electricity prices were recorded during the quarter. Despite these merchant market conditions, our hedging strategy provided significant downside protection, as we hedged 65% of Gecama's anticipated production at a high price of €100 for 2024. As we show in the slide deck accompanying this quarter's results, even in an extreme case where merchant prices for the rest of 2024 end up 50% below the internal forecasts we made at the start of the year, our corporate adjusted EBITDA would only drop by 2% from the midpoint of our guidance range. I would like to emphasize that we do not expect lower merchant prices to impact our Financial Outlook for 2024. Moreover, we are also looking to adapt our commercial strategy to current conditions. After the extraordinary returns that we have made at Gecama, where heavy merchant market exposure over the past two years has returned half of the equity we invested in the project, we are now considering options of entering into a long term PPA. To sum up, this quarter showed strong financial performance and we continue to be on schedule in meeting our COD and project development goals. Business fundamentals in the US are very supportive for our planned expansion there, with rising power demand and low equipment costs translating into higher PPA pricing and increasing project returns. It is exactly these trends that enable Enlight to achieve its dual goal of delivering higher-than-market growth at higher-than market returns. I'd now like to hand the call over to Jason.

Jason Ellsworth: Thank you Gilad, Enlight and Clenera are rapidly expanding in the U.S. and we are laser focused on construction and project finance. In total, we plan to be in active construction on more than 1.2 GW of solar and 3.2 GWh of battery during 2024. Our 364 MW and 1.2 GWh Atrisco project in New Mexico is on schedule. We expect to reach COD on the solar in the third quarter. The solar project has already reached mechanical completion and commissioning work is underway. The battery is expected to be complete during the fourth quarter; equipment is almost all on site and work is underway to connect the initial circuits. Looking beyond Atrisco, we plan to begin construction on Country Acres, Quail Ranch and Roadrunner in the second half. These projects together total 810 MW of generation and over 2 GWh of energy storage. The 392 MW and 688 MWh Country Acres project in California is expected to begin first. All regulatory and permitting hurdles are clear and construction contracts are nearly complete. Quail Ranch is not far behind. The 128 MW and 400 MWh project in New Mexico is ready to start construction but awaiting PPA regulatory approval. Finally, the 290 MW and 940 MWh Roadrunner project in Arizona is completing its remaining governmental approvals. Before year end, we expect all three of these projects to enter construction. Each is an important part of delivering our 2026 objectives. Our CO Bar project in Arizona is comprised of 3 busbar PPAs totaling approximately 1.2 GW and 824 MWh and contracted with APS and SRP. The APS queue reform is ongoing and is still on track to support a year-end 2026 COD for the vast majority of the project, with the remainder to follow in early 2027. We continue to engage with APS to advance the interconnection work as quickly as possible. As a reminder, another 3.2 GWh of battery potential is under development at the site but not yet contracted. Taking a step back, we continue to see strong support for our project fundamentals. PPA pricing remains sticky, in light of the trends Gilad mentioned earlier. Equipment prices have also declined, with cost for both solar panels and batteries falling in the past year. Since the beginning of 2023 both solar module and battery pricing have dropped by approximately 30% to 35%. This has served to offset the increase in financing costs and deliver improved returns. Turning to supply chain, there is currently renewed concern regarding possible trade sanctions aimed at Asian equipment producers. Clenera uses modules supplied from SE Asia and India that are audited by third parties to ensure compliance with today's UFLPA and AD/CVD rules. Our suppliers have proven ability to work efficiently and successfully through routine customs investigations and deliver on time. If additional sanctions emerge, Clenera has supply contingency plans in place to limit potential sanction impact, including use of U.S. assembled bifacial panels and batteries. On a final note, Adam will lead the company's US commentary next quarter. I'm excited to see the organization grow and develop under his exceptional leadership. I'd now like to turn the call over to Nir for a review of our quarterly results.

Nir Yehuda: Thank you, Jason. In the first quarter of 2024, the company's revenues increased to $90 million, up from $71 million last year, a growth rate of 27% year over year. Growth was mainly driven by new operational projects compared to last year, while being offset by a decline in revenues caused by much lower electricity prices in Spain relative to the prices observed in the same quarter last year. Since the first quarter of last year, 10 new projects in the US, Hungary and Israel started selling electricity. The most important of these is Genesis Wind which contributed $9 million to revenue. In addition, Bjornberget which barely sold power at the start of 2023, contributed $7 million in this quarter. Gecama generated approximately $20 million in revenues; however, its contribution fell 6% year over year due to much lower Spanish power prices compared to Q1 '23. We sold power in Spain at an overall average price of €65 per MWh this quarter versus €85 per MWh in the same period last year. The decline in pricing was offset by very high production volumes which were 20% higher than last year, as well as the results of our hedging strategy which allowed us to sell 52% of Gecama's production at a price of €98 per MWh. In Israel, 7 of the 12 Solar plus storage cluster units are now in operation contributing $3 million, while none were selling electricity in the same period last year. Finally, the reclassification of financial asset projects in Israel to fixed asset projects boosted revenues by $3 million, though at the same time, we moved the sum from the financial income line. Fourth quarter net income has declined by 26% to $24 million from $33 million last year due to unusually high finance income in 2023. In the first quarter of last year, we recorded a one-off $12 million benefit caused by the depreciation of the Israeli Shekel on the large amount of cash the company had received following completion of our NASDAQ IPO in February 2023. In addition, we recorded a $2 million non-cash gain in Q1 '24 stemming from the mark-to-market of interest rate hedges and a positive revaluation of foreign exchange-denominated liabilities. Cash flow from operations declined by 36% to $35 million from $55 million last year influenced by working capital. In the first quarter of '24, the company's adjusted EBITDA grew by 28% to $68 million compared to $54 million for the same period in 2023. On the whole adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by the same positive factors which affected our revenue growth. Looking to our balance sheet, Enlight achieved 2 financial closings for projects in Central Europe. We raised a $95 million loan for the construction of the Pupin wind project in Serbia and a $42 million financing facility for the construction of the Tapolca solar project in Hungary. We also recycled $29 million of excess capital back to Enlight as a result of this transaction. In addition, Enlight has $325 million of revolving credit facilities at Israeli and international banks as of the balance sheet date, none of which have been drawn. This is $65 million above what we reported in our Q4 '23 results. Moving to 2024 guidance, given the strong set of results we delivered for the first quarter, we reaffirm our financial outlook for the year, expecting annual revenue between $335 to $360 million and with adjusted EBITDA between $235 million and $255 million. In addition, 90% of 2024 generation output will be sold at fixed prices either through hedges or PPAs. Our guidance reflects annual growth of 36% and 30% at the midpoint compared to 2023 respectively, demonstrating our accelerated growth path in 2024 and the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Clare with ROTH MKM.

Justin Clare: Hi, everyone. First off, I just wanted to start on module supply. I was wondering, since the announcement of the latest AD/CVD case that's targeting Southeast Asian countries, can you talk about whether you're seeing any change in the market so far? You mentioned pricing is down to $0.25 a watt. Are you seeing that change? Are you seeing it move higher at this point? And then if tariffs were placed on both cells and modules from Southeast Asia, can you just talk about your ability to access supply and whether you see any potential for disruption to your product time lines?

Jason Ellsworth: Certainly on our mind, something we've been spending a good amount of time on as we work through details related to supply chain. So specifically, we're seeing the market remain fairly stable in terms of supply and pricing. There is some shuffling going on and certainly, some of that shuffling is an increased emphasis on investment in the U.S. and acceleration on those investments by producers who are looking to increase U.S. content as the demand is there and there's likely need for that in the future. In the meantime, we're seeing a mix in terms of our supply chain that is manageable given the outcomes, especially given our emphasis on non-targeted Southeast Asia supply. That said, we also have a solid set of relationships and work related to supply out of the U.S. that would allow us to size-step eventual issues. With some cost impact but it's a manageable amount of cost impact, a few pennies of cost impact to us and then to the projects. Of course, the benefit there is additional opportunity related to domestic content and the upside related to domestic content if that shift occurs. So we see this in large part, a neutral topic in the near term and potentially in the longer term, accelerating the shift to domestic supply that will, in fact, benefit the projects.

Gilad Yavetz: I will add 2 short points to that. First, in general, we still see a positive trend in terms of the panels pricing. So, we see them still going down and then offsetting some of the other elements and it's worth to mention the strategic step we did last year with Waaree, the Indian supplier and the MSA that we have with this supplier that allows us very good responsiveness to the AD/CVD future steps that will be taken. So we have a good source that we believe will be available.

Justin Clare: Just to follow on that with the domestic content adder, can you talk about the timing potential in which you think you could secure that out on the solar side of the business but then also for storage projects as well. I am curious what the time frame might be?

Gilad Yavetz: We are aligning some of our projects in order to get more from the domestic content, especially in projects where the tax equity path will be ITC, then we see a strong benefit for that. For example, Rustic Hills and we believe that for '27, we will be on track to get the adder on that.

Justin Clare: We've seen obviously a very strong increase in demand for electricity from data centers, wondering if you're looking to participate in RFPs that are being done from data centers and whether or not those might incorporate solar and storage?

Gilad Yavetz: I think it's a great question. We see a very positive environment for us right now that is being created in the U.S. because of the data center growth that leads to this increase in electricity demand primarily and also opens up a lot of opportunities for us also in the business model. So it's not only participating in PPAs, we are reviewing and exploring other business development and even M&A options that are related to this trend which we believe that will be long term.

Jason Ellsworth: In the West which is obviously power constrained and with big data center builds over the next decade, that is contracted via the utility. So the utility will leave the corporate demand through a PPA direct with the utility. So we won't see it in an RFP with the data center providers directly. We'll see it with increased demand from the utilities and just given the interconnection positions we hold in the West, we think that puts us in a really position to deliver in the near term for those data center clients which is a huge value to them.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi from Mizuho.

Maheep Mandloi: Just on the module procurement, can you talk about the sourcing. You talked about Waaree being one of the word big ones, are you looking solar cells from them or potentially modules from their potential expansion in the U.S.? Or do you have any other suppliers lined up for that as well?

Jason Ellsworth: Our relationship with Waaree includes solar cells and Waaree is a producer of solar cells. Their produced solar cells are part of our sourcing plan with them and our contractual relationship. We're continuing to look at the advent and introduction of solar cells in the U.S. and that's a longer-term equation, i.e. 2027 time frame for projects and domestic content that Gilad was referencing. We're targeting that time frame to be careful, though, we're, of course, open to and working on accelerating as much as possible as it relates to other projects and opportunities that might pull us in a little earlier than that but 2027 is really the reasonable time frame that we're looking at to include U.S. sales.

Maheep Mandloi: You kind of talked about everything seems the target on track but curious on your thoughts on how should we think about going forward? Do you expect any bottlenecks over here on a run rate basis, either from EPC constraints or transformer switchgear constraints. For the market, then we're obviously hearing from some of the suppliers that projects are getting pushed out. But just curious, why you're not seeing that right now? And what are your expectations for that going forward?

Gilad Yavetz: This is a great question. I think that we are very confident right now on the operational track, First on Atrisco, that is a major project for us and we plan the COD of both the solar side and the battery side before the end of '24 and we are at least on track. I believe that we took a very important operational and procurement decisions that will also support construction on time of the new projects that we are going to build in the U.S. in '24, including decision for transformers that we did and other elements that can be bottlenecked. So we feel quite confident right now on our plans.

Jason Ellsworth: If I may add to Gilad's point, I think all those projects have signed interconnection agreements, signed PPAs, real estate and for the large part, all their permits. So that gives us a large degree of comfort on the milestones that these projects have achieved that were on plan, if not ahead.

Maheep Mandloi: Then maybe just one last one on merchant pricing in Spain, the table in the press release is pretty useful to understand the sensitivity. The spot prices in Spain are almost around €30 right now per MWh, almost 50% below your assumption of 68.5% that imply like EBITDA could be 2% below the midpoint for the rest of the year.

Gilad Yavetz: The current price today may be €30 but if you look at the forwards for the remainder of the year, they're in the 70% range, if not higher. So there's been kind of a short-term decline in power prices which we've seen in February and mostly in March which has been driven by strong hydro and a lot of wind and solar resource. The hydro was expected to come off which is why you see the near-term future is at the 70% range, July, August, September and so on and so forth. So the 30 is maybe today's price but it's not the expectation of price in the market for the remainder of the year. I would add to that is that the point we are making in the presentation is our resilience to even a short-term downturn in the spot prices in Spain and the point that we just have shown is that even in a reduction of 50% in the merchant prices, we don't see any impact on the EBITDA. The opposite, what we see is positive results in other projects. So, we do not see any reason why to reduce our guidelines, maybe to the opposite but we will consider that next quarter. On the long term, we see also in Spain, very good forecast and forward for the electricity prices, including PPAs. So, the fact that we get offers right now for 10 years PPA on a high basis provide us a lot of confidence that we can either remain in the merchant profile where we have benefited a lot in the last 2 years and basically being able to withdraw more than 50% of the equity of the project. We had a very good up in the last 2 years and what we see currently forward for the next 10 years is good levels of prices and also flexibility to sign long-term PPA at high levels that represent higher returns than the original model. So, I think that we stand there with very good situation. In Spain, I think this was the goal of showing that table on the filter.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.

Michael Fairbanks: This is Michael Fairbanks on for Mark Strauss. For the U.S. development pipeline, how are you feeling about the availability of tax equity, particularly on the PTC (NASDAQ: PTC ) side. We've heard some tightness there. So just wondering, if you're seeing that and to what extent can you use transferability to offset that?

Gilad Yavetz: I think the profile of our offtake rest of the fundamentals but primarily offtake of our project in the West is very attractive to tax equity providers because we have long-term busbar PPAs for 20 and in some projects, 30 years with a very solid profile. So as produced, we don't have any exposure to curtailment as opposed to have set of PPAs that you can find in other areas. So this leads to a very strong demand that we are getting for tax equity for the project. So we feel less the bottlenecks right now and I think that this is one of the advantages of the portfolio that we see right now in [indiscernible] and specifically with the project online right now.

Jason Ellsworth: There's also the optionality that transferability has provided to do the hybrid structures which is around the tax equity provider syndicating the credits to corporate clients of theirs which have tax exposure and then retaining the interest for the purposes of monetizing the depreciation. So, there's plenty of demand. It's just a matter of exactly the structure that works best for us.

Michael Fairbanks: Any update you guys have on the overall ramp-up at the Genesis the wind projects since the last call?

Gilad Yavetz: It's on plan and even better than planned. We see improved performance of both plants and also we are getting to continuous arrangement with the supplier in the past. So, we feel very good there.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Paz with Wolfe Research.

David Paz: I wanted to just circle back on the PJM portfolio that you touched on it. If you could maybe at a high level talk about your plans in that market and in particular, all the demand that of course, we're seeing from data centers and so forth. Do you anticipate, as part of your farm-down strategy, I think it was 30% or so on going forward, just one of those kind of portfolios that we should look at, what kind of interest are you seeing and are you particularly looking at breaking it down pieces or that you mentioned on your one of your earlier comments on M&A, just maybe overall, just address your PJM strategy.

Gilad Yavetz: First, to begin with, we continue to advance the PJM portfolio. It has advanced well. We have more than 5 projects there but with 5 projects, we are on fast track and with network operate cost of less than $5 million per project which I think is a fantastic for PJM. I understand that on the fast track, Enlight holds 40% of the project right now that are on the fast track on PJM. I think it is amazing. Then, to your question, yes, we believe that PJM is a potential for our strategy on the sell down. There are some elements in PJM were, [indiscernible] project is good. Options for doing this kind of equity recycle we mentioned in previous quarter when the project finally completely matures and get to their optimal value, we believe that the high PPA prices in PJM derived by the data centers demand and multiple players that are interested in projects there may create a very high upside for us in this market.

David Paz: Just on your unlevered return target for your '24 to '26 portfolio, obviously, that was great to see a 50 basis point improvement. How locked in from here, are those returns? Do you anticipate more movement, just with those set of projects on your returns or if you walked in the pricing and so forth that we should probably kind of think of that in a steady state?

Jason Ellsworth: PPAs are signed for over 90% of that block. So the revenue side, obviously, we feel great degree of confidence. On the cost side, we're naturally going to procurement in a significant way and on everything, we're going to obviously start building this year. So we're in advanced negotiations on procurement decisions. For example, on the 3 big projects in the U.S. that we're going to commence construction this year, naturally we have the Atrisco project where procurement is obviously all done and that's locked in. Yes, we feel pretty good. I think the CO Bar which is obviously a big project which we hope to make some procurement decisions by the end of this year, early next.

Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session and I will now turn the call back over to Yosef for closing remarks.

Yosef Lefkovitz: Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone for joining today. We will be at the JPMorgan Energy Conference in New York, as well as ROTH Sustainability Conference in London, and we look forward to catching you up there.

President Joe Biden also recently made similar statements. In his opinion, this would protect the American auto industry and the many jobs it supports from cheap Chinese crap and prevent American electric car production from collapsing under Chinese pressure in the same way it did before solar panel production. For Biden, of course, it's not just about economic rationality, but also a perfect election campaign issue, because the auto industry provides jobs for millions of people in several swing states, which could be crucial in the November election.

Punitive tariffs on Chinese goods have been widely used by Donald Trump as one of the main weapons in the trade war with the Chinese, the success of which is doubtful. The new regulation, which also includes the 100 percent electric car tariff, is expected to be announced on Tuesday, along with a number of other changes to the current tariffs.

The Biden administration has already invested billions of dollars in subsidies into the American green energy industry to reduce its dependence on the Chinese economy through domestic production and to create jobs in the Rust Belt states, where many factories and mines have closed in recent decades due to cheap electricity Chinese competition. An investigation was also launched in February to determine whether Chinese smart car solutions could pose a national security risk and whether internet-connected vehicles could provide the Chinese with a loophole to critical American infrastructure.

According to experts, the Chinese could even pay the 100 percent tariff if they were able to penetrate the American market with their electric cars. It is also on the map that the Chinese state supports the car factories, precisely in the amount that they have to pay in customs for their cars that are intended for American imports. And it is almost unpredictable how the Chinese will react if the Americans impose a 100 percent tariff, whether they will impose similar special taxes on American products.

It is a big question whether the punitive tariff, if indeed increased to four times, will only apply to cars assembled in China or whether it will also apply to cars manufactured by Chinese companies in other countries. This is practically just a question of intention and wording on the American side, but it can also be important for us because Chinese car factories are setting up shop in Hungary. If the punitive tariff does not apply to Chinese products manufactured in the EU, this could further strengthen the desire of Chinese companies to expand in Hungary.",newsbeezer.com,news,newsbeezer.com,,-0.1215686274509804,453232277,4,,

Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.

Gilad Yavetz

Thank you, Yosef and thank you all for joining us today. Enlight is off to a strong start to the year and we are pleased to present a robust set of financial results for the first quarter. Revenue grew 27% year over year to $90 million, while Adjusted EBITDA grew 28% year over year to $68 million in the quarter. We benefited during the quarter from high production levels across our 1.9 GW operational portfolio, particularly at some of our largest wind farms. Net income was $24 million versus $33 million last year which benefitted from one-off financing income we recognized post-IPO last year which Nir will explain in more detail later on. On the back of these results, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year 2024 guidance.

In addition to the strong financial results, we continued to execute on our project portfolio during the quarter. Our projects are proceeding on schedule, including the 579 MW and 1.7 GWh expected to reach COD this year, as well as the 1.1 GW and 2.9 GWh of new projects we expect to start construction this year. Enlight is on the cusp of a major expansion which will ultimately result in the tripling of the company's generation and storage capacity to 5.1 GW and 5.7 GWh by 2026. We are laser focused on the execution and delivery of our plan.

Let me describe what we are seeing in the United States, where the industry fundamental backdrop is one of the best we have ever seen. First off, demand for electricity is increasing. For most of the past decade, forecasts for long-term annual U.S. load growth stood at approximately 0.5% per year. But this accelerated in 2023, when forecasts for long term demand nearly doubled to 0.9% a year until 2028. This represents an additional 38 GW of peak demand over the next five years. To put that in perspective, that is the equivalent of 75% of California's peak load today. This rapid acceleration in demand has been driven by the re-shoring of manufacturing, EVs and most importantly the installation of data centers which consume an immense quantum of power and there is a strong possibility that this does not capture the true demand picture which could rise up to 1.5% annual growth until the end of this decade. This also explains why PPA pricing remains high, even as equipment prices have been falling.

Enlight is uniquely positioned for this tight power market environment, with a broad set of projects that are deliverable in the short-to-medium term. These projects include Atrisco, our 364 MW and 1.2 GWh flagship project located in New Mexico which will see completion of its solar component during the third quarter of this year, while the storage part is on track for COD during the fourth quarter, both as planned. Moreover, Quail Ranch, Roadrunner and Country Acres, the 3 major projects we expect to start construction in the United States in 2024 totaling 810 MW and 2.0 GWh, have completed all critical development milestones and are on schedule. We will soon initiate major procurement for these projects. Equipment pricing remains beneficial to us, with panel prices around $0.25. All-in battery prices are now $170. Both these elements have fallen by 30% to 35% from the start of 2023. All these factors combined contribute to improving unlevered returns on the projects that we are planning to build between now and 2026. These stand at 10.5%, an improvement of 50 bps since last quarter and with addition of financing, reach mid- to high-teens levels on the levered equity return.

In Europe, while short-term power prices have been unusually low, long-term power prices remain high, reflecting attractive returns for Enlight's operational and development portfolio as we continue to secure important milestones at our near-term projects. We reached financial close for our 94 MW wind farm, Project Pupin in Serbia, arranging a $95 million financing package from EBRD and Erste, the same partners who financed our operational Blacksmith project which is adjacent to Pupin. Pupin which has a signed 15-year CFD agreement at €69 per MWh, is now under construction and is expected to reach COD as planned in the second half of 2025.

In addition, we reached financial close on two of our smaller Hungarian projects, recovering $29 million of excess equity invested. The normalization of European energy prices and the prevailing higher cost of capital are sparking a greater flow of attractive later stage project acquisition opportunities across the continent. We are currently evaluating several project acquisitions and we may seek to take advantage of this opportunistic window.

In Israel, we continue to engage with the newly deregulated power sector, enhancing our ability to generate and sell electricity to different segments of our home market. Arad Valley 3, a part of the Israel Solar & Storage cluster, reached COD during the first quarter, as we maintain the rollout of this project cluster through 2024. We also signed PPAs with 2 additional companies for 50 MW of supply, as we further expand our reach into Israel's corporate power market. Finally, we announced the formation of a new subsidiary named Enlight Local, led by one of the top management teams in Israel which will address the power needs of Israeli municipalities and agricultural customers by building distributed power infrastructure.

Finally, turning to our operational portfolio, electricity generation volumes at most of our wind farms were well above expectations, including at Gecama in Spain, Blacksmith in Serbia and Genesis Wind in Israel. This was partly offset by weaker merchant pricing, especially at Gecama, where low electricity prices were recorded during the quarter. Despite these merchant market conditions, our hedging strategy provided significant downside protection, as we hedged 65% of Gecama's anticipated production at a high price of €100 for 2024.

As we show in the slide deck accompanying this quarter's results, even in an extreme case where merchant prices for the rest of 2024 end up 50% below the internal forecasts we made at the start of the year, our corporate adjusted EBITDA would only drop by 2% from the midpoint of our guidance range. I would like to emphasize that we do not expect lower merchant prices to impact our Financial Outlook for 2024. Moreover, we are also looking to adapt our commercial strategy to current conditions. After the extraordinary returns that we have made at Gecama, where heavy merchant market exposure over the past two years has returned half of the equity we invested in the project, we are now considering options of entering into a long term PPA.

To sum up, this quarter showed strong financial performance and we continue to be on schedule in meeting our COD and project development goals. Business fundamentals in the US are very supportive for our planned expansion there, with rising power demand and low equipment costs translating into higher PPA pricing and increasing project returns. It is exactly these trends that enable Enlight to achieve its dual goal of delivering higher-than-market growth at higher-than market returns.

Thank you Gilad, Enlight and Clenera are rapidly expanding in the U.S. and we are laser focused on construction and project finance. In total, we plan to be in active construction on more than 1.2 GW of solar and 3.2 GWh of battery during 2024. Our 364 MW and 1.2 GWh Atrisco project in New Mexico is on schedule. We expect to reach COD on the solar in the third quarter. The solar project has already reached mechanical completion and commissioning work is underway. The battery is expected to be complete during the fourth quarter; equipment is almost all on site and work is underway to connect the initial circuits.

Looking beyond Atrisco, we plan to begin construction on Country Acres, Quail Ranch and Roadrunner in the second half. These projects together total 810 MW of generation and over 2 GWh of energy storage. The 392 MW and 688 MWh Country Acres project in California is expected to begin first. All regulatory and permitting hurdles are clear and construction contracts are nearly complete. Quail Ranch is not far behind. The 128 MW and 400 MWh project in New Mexico is ready to start construction but awaiting PPA regulatory approval. Finally, the 290 MW and 940 MWh Roadrunner project in Arizona is completing its remaining governmental approvals. Before year end, we expect all three of these projects to enter construction. Each is an important part of delivering our 2026 objectives.

Our CO Bar project in Arizona is comprised of 3 busbar PPAs totaling approximately 1.2 GW and 824 MWh and contracted with APS and SRP. The APS queue reform is ongoing and is still on track to support a year-end 2026 COD for the vast majority of the project, with the remainder to follow in early 2027. We continue to engage with APS to advance the interconnection work as quickly as possible. As a reminder, another 3.2 GWh of battery potential is under development at the site but not yet contracted.

Taking a step back, we continue to see strong support for our project fundamentals. PPA pricing remains sticky, in light of the trends Gilad mentioned earlier. Equipment prices have also declined, with cost for both solar panels and batteries falling in the past year. Since the beginning of 2023 both solar module and battery pricing have dropped by approximately 30% to 35%. This has served to offset the increase in financing costs and deliver improved returns.

Turning to supply chain, there is currently renewed concern regarding possible trade sanctions aimed at Asian equipment producers. Clenera uses modules supplied from SE Asia and India that are audited by third parties to ensure compliance with today's UFLPA and AD/CVD rules. Our suppliers have proven ability to work efficiently and successfully through routine customs investigations and deliver on time. If additional sanctions emerge, Clenera has supply contingency plans in place to limit potential sanction impact, including use of U.S. assembled bifacial panels and batteries.

On a final note, Adam will lead the company's US commentary next quarter. I'm excited to see the organization grow and develop under his exceptional leadership.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Nir for a review of our quarterly results.

Nir Yehuda

Thank you, Jason. In the first quarter of 2024, the company's revenues increased to $90 million, up from $71 million last year, a growth rate of 27% year over year. Growth was mainly driven by new operational projects compared to last year, while being offset by a decline in revenues caused by much lower electricity prices in Spain relative to the prices observed in the same quarter last year. Since the first quarter of last year, 10 new projects in the US, Hungary and Israel started selling electricity. The most important of these is Genesis Wind which contributed $9 million to revenue.

In addition, Bjornberget which barely sold power at the start of 2023, contributed $7 million in this quarter. Gecama generated approximately $20 million in revenues; however, its contribution fell 6% year over year due to much lower Spanish power prices compared to Q1 '23. We sold power in Spain at an overall average price of €65 per MWh this quarter versus €85 per MWh in the same period last year. The decline in pricing was offset by very high production volumes which were 20% higher than last year, as well as the results of our hedging strategy which allowed us to sell 52% of Gecama's production at a price of €98 per MWh.

In Israel, 7 of the 12 Solar plus storage cluster units are now in operation contributing $3 million, while none were selling electricity in the same period last year. Finally, the reclassification of financial asset projects in Israel to fixed asset projects boosted revenues by $3 million, though at the same time, we moved the sum from the financial income line.

Fourth quarter net income has declined by 26% to $24 million from $33 million last year due to unusually high finance income in 2023. In the first quarter of last year, we recorded a one-off $12 million benefit caused by the depreciation of the Israeli Shekel on the large amount of cash the company had received following completion of our NASDAQ IPO in February 2023. In addition, we recorded a $2 million non-cash gain in Q1 '24 stemming from the mark-to-market of interest rate hedges and a positive revaluation of foreign exchange-denominated liabilities. Cash flow from operations declined by 36% to $35 million from $55 million last year influenced by working capital. In the first quarter of '24, the company's adjusted EBITDA grew by 28% to $68 million compared to $54 million for the same period in 2023. On the whole adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by the same positive factors which affected our revenue growth.

Looking to our balance sheet, Enlight achieved 2 financial closings for projects in Central Europe. We raised a $95 million loan for the construction of the Pupin wind project in Serbia and a $42 million financing facility for the construction of the Tapolca solar project in Hungary. We also recycled $29 million of excess capital back to Enlight as a result of this transaction. In addition, Enlight has $325 million of revolving credit facilities at Israeli and international banks as of the balance sheet date, none of which have been drawn. This is $65 million above what we reported in our Q4 '23 results.

Moving to 2024 guidance, given the strong set of results we delivered for the first quarter, we reaffirm our financial outlook for the year, expecting annual revenue between $335 to $360 million and with adjusted EBITDA between $235 million and $255 million. In addition, 90% of 2024 generation output will be sold at fixed prices either through hedges or PPAs. Our guidance reflects annual growth of 36% and 30% at the midpoint compared to 2023 respectively, demonstrating our accelerated growth path in 2024 and the years ahead.

I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Clare with ROTH MKM.

Justin Clare

Hi, everyone. First off, I just wanted to start on module supply. I was wondering, since the announcement of the latest AD/CVD case that's targeting Southeast Asian countries, can you talk about whether you're seeing any change in the market so far? You mentioned pricing is down to $0.25 a watt. Are you seeing that change? Are you seeing it move higher at this point? And then if tariffs were placed on both cells and modules from Southeast Asia, can you just talk about your ability to access supply and whether you see any potential for disruption to your product time lines?

Jason Ellsworth

Certainly on our mind, something we've been spending a good amount of time on as we work through details related to supply chain. So specifically, we're seeing the market remain fairly stable in terms of supply and pricing. There is some shuffling going on and certainly, some of that shuffling is an increased emphasis on investment in the U.S. and acceleration on those investments by producers who are looking to increase U.S. content as the demand is there and there's likely need for that in the future. In the meantime, we're seeing a mix in terms of our supply chain that is manageable given the outcomes, especially given our emphasis on non-targeted Southeast Asia supply. That said, we also have a solid set of relationships and work related to supply out of the U.S. that would allow us to size-step eventual issues.

With some cost impact but it's a manageable amount of cost impact, a few pennies of cost impact to us and then to the projects. Of course, the benefit there is additional opportunity related to domestic content and the upside related to domestic content if that shift occurs. So we see this in large part, a neutral topic in the near term and potentially in the longer term, accelerating the shift to domestic supply that will, in fact, benefit the projects.

Gilad Yavetz

I will add 2 short points to that. First, in general, we still see a positive trend in terms of the panels pricing. So, we see them still going down and then offsetting some of the other elements and it's worth to mention the strategic step we did last year with Waaree, the Indian supplier and the MSA that we have with this supplier that allows us very good responsiveness to the AD/CVD future steps that will be taken. So we have a good source that we believe will be available.

Justin Clare

Just to follow on that with the domestic content adder, can you talk about the timing potential in which you think you could secure that out on the solar side of the business but then also for storage projects as well. I am curious what the time frame might be?

Gilad Yavetz

We are aligning some of our projects in order to get more from the domestic content, especially in projects where the tax equity path will be ITC, then we see a strong benefit for that. For example, Rustic Hills and we believe that for '27, we will be on track to get the adder on that.

Justin Clare

We've seen obviously a very strong increase in demand for electricity from data centers, wondering if you're looking to participate in RFPs that are being done from data centers and whether or not those might incorporate solar and storage?

Gilad Yavetz

I think it's a great question. We see a very positive environment for us right now that is being created in the U.S. because of the data center growth that leads to this increase in electricity demand primarily and also opens up a lot of opportunities for us also in the business model. So it's not only participating in PPAs, we are reviewing and exploring other business development and even M&A options that are related to this trend which we believe that will be long term.

Jason Ellsworth

In the West which is obviously power constrained and with big data center builds over the next decade, that is contracted via the utility. So the utility will leave the corporate demand through a PPA direct with the utility. So we won't see it in an RFP with the data center providers directly. We'll see it with increased demand from the utilities and just given the interconnection positions we hold in the West, we think that puts us in a really position to deliver in the near term for those data center clients which is a huge value to them.

Your next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi from Mizuho.

Maheep Mandloi

Just on the module procurement, can you talk about the sourcing. You talked about Waaree being one of the word big ones, are you looking solar cells from them or potentially modules from their potential expansion in the U.S.? Or do you have any other suppliers lined up for that as well?

Jason Ellsworth

Our relationship with Waaree includes solar cells and Waaree is a producer of solar cells. Their produced solar cells are part of our sourcing plan with them and our contractual relationship. We're continuing to look at the advent and introduction of solar cells in the U.S. and that's a longer-term equation, i.e. 2027 time frame for projects and domestic content that Gilad was referencing. We're targeting that time frame to be careful, though, we're, of course, open to and working on accelerating as much as possible as it relates to other projects and opportunities that might pull us in a little earlier than that but 2027 is really the reasonable time frame that we're looking at to include U.S. sales.

Maheep Mandloi

You kind of talked about everything seems the target on track but curious on your thoughts on how should we think about going forward? Do you expect any bottlenecks over here on a run rate basis, either from EPC constraints or transformer switchgear constraints. For the market, then we're obviously hearing from some of the suppliers that projects are getting pushed out. But just curious, why you're not seeing that right now? And what are your expectations for that going forward?

Gilad Yavetz

This is a great question. I think that we are very confident right now on the operational track, First on Atrisco, that is a major project for us and we plan the COD of both the solar side and the battery side before the end of '24 and we are at least on track. I believe that we took a very important operational and procurement decisions that will also support construction on time of the new projects that we are going to build in the U.S. in '24, including decision for transformers that we did and other elements that can be bottlenecked. So we feel quite confident right now on our plans.

Jason Ellsworth

If I may add to Gilad's point, I think all those projects have signed interconnection agreements, signed PPAs, real estate and for the large part, all their permits. So that gives us a large degree of comfort on the milestones that these projects have achieved that were on plan, if not ahead.

Maheep Mandloi

Then maybe just one last one on merchant pricing in Spain, the table in the press release is pretty useful to understand the sensitivity. The spot prices in Spain are almost around €30 right now per MWh, almost 50% below your assumption of 68.5% that imply like EBITDA could be 2% below the midpoint for the rest of the year.

Gilad Yavetz

The current price today may be €30 but if you look at the forwards for the remainder of the year, they're in the 70% range, if not higher. So there's been kind of a short-term decline in power prices which we've seen in February and mostly in March which has been driven by strong hydro and a lot of wind and solar resource. The hydro was expected to come off which is why you see the near-term future is at the 70% range, July, August, September and so on and so forth. So the 30 is maybe today's price but it's not the expectation of price in the market for the remainder of the year.

I would add to that is that the point we are making in the presentation is our resilience to even a short-term downturn in the spot prices in Spain and the point that we just have shown is that even in a reduction of 50% in the merchant prices, we don't see any impact on the EBITDA. The opposite, what we see is positive results in other projects. So, we do not see any reason why to reduce our guidelines, maybe to the opposite but we will consider that next quarter.

On the long term, we see also in Spain, very good forecast and forward for the electricity prices, including PPAs. So, the fact that we get offers right now for 10 years PPA on a high basis provide us a lot of confidence that we can either remain in the merchant profile where we have benefited a lot in the last 2 years and basically being able to withdraw more than 50% of the equity of the project.

We had a very good up in the last 2 years and what we see currently forward for the next 10 years is good levels of prices and also flexibility to sign long-term PPA at high levels that represent higher returns than the original model. So, I think that we stand there with very good situation. In Spain, I think this was the goal of showing that table on the filter.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.

Michael Fairbanks

This is Michael Fairbanks on for Mark Strauss. For the U.S. development pipeline, how are you feeling about the availability of tax equity, particularly on the PTC side. We've heard some tightness there. So just wondering, if you're seeing that and to what extent can you use transferability to offset that?

Gilad Yavetz

I think the profile of our offtake rest of the fundamentals but primarily offtake of our project in the West is very attractive to tax equity providers because we have long-term busbar PPAs for 20 and in some projects, 30 years with a very solid profile. So as produced, we don't have any exposure to curtailment as opposed to have set of PPAs that you can find in other areas. So this leads to a very strong demand that we are getting for tax equity for the project. So we feel less the bottlenecks right now and I think that this is one of the advantages of the portfolio that we see right now in [indiscernible] and specifically with the project online right now.

Jason Ellsworth

There's also the optionality that transferability has provided to do the hybrid structures which is around the tax equity provider syndicating the credits to corporate clients of theirs which have tax exposure and then retaining the interest for the purposes of monetizing the depreciation. So, there's plenty of demand. It's just a matter of exactly the structure that works best for us.

Michael Fairbanks

Any update you guys have on the overall ramp-up at the Genesis the wind projects since the last call?

Gilad Yavetz

It's on plan and even better than planned. We see improved performance of both plants and also we are getting to continuous arrangement with the supplier in the past. So, we feel very good there.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Paz with Wolfe Research.

David Paz

I wanted to just circle back on the PJM portfolio that you touched on it. If you could maybe at a high level talk about your plans in that market and in particular, all the demand that of course, we're seeing from data centers and so forth. Do you anticipate, as part of your farm-down strategy, I think it was 30% or so on going forward, just one of those kind of portfolios that we should look at, what kind of interest are you seeing and are you particularly looking at breaking it down pieces or that you mentioned on your one of your earlier comments on M&A, just maybe overall, just address your PJM strategy.

Gilad Yavetz

First, to begin with, we continue to advance the PJM portfolio. It has advanced well. We have more than 5 projects there but with 5 projects, we are on fast track and with network operate cost of less than $5 million per project which I think is a fantastic for PJM. I understand that on the fast track, Enlight holds 40% of the project right now that are on the fast track on PJM. I think it is amazing.

Then, to your question, yes, we believe that PJM is a potential for our strategy on the sell down. There are some elements in PJM were, [indiscernible] project is good. Options for doing this kind of equity recycle we mentioned in previous quarter when the project finally completely matures and get to their optimal value, we believe that the high PPA prices in PJM derived by the data centers demand and multiple players that are interested in projects there may create a very high upside for us in this market.

David Paz

Just on your unlevered return target for your '24 to '26 portfolio, obviously, that was great to see a 50 basis point improvement. How locked in from here, are those returns? Do you anticipate more movement, just with those set of projects on your returns or if you walked in the pricing and so forth that we should probably kind of think of that in a steady state?

Jason Ellsworth

PPAs are signed for over 90% of that block. So the revenue side, obviously, we feel great degree of confidence. On the cost side, we're naturally going to procurement in a significant way and on everything, we're going to obviously start building this year. So we're in advanced negotiations on procurement decisions. For example, on the 3 big projects in the U.S. that we're going to commence construction this year, naturally we have the Atrisco project where procurement is obviously all done and that's locked in. Yes, we feel pretty good. I think the CO Bar which is obviously a big project which we hope to make some procurement decisions by the end of this year, early next.

That concludes our question-and-answer session and I will now turn the call back over to Yosef for closing remarks.

It has now achieved the 4+ ""Transition"" level in the Airports Council International's Airport Carbon Accreditation program.

According to BUD, less than 10% (52) of the more than 550 airports participating in the assessment have achieved this level. Ferenc Liszt International is the first in the Central European region.

The ACI's Airport Carbon Accreditation is the only global, institutionally approved program assessing the carbon emissions of the world's airports, ranking them on a scale of one to five.

The 4+ ""Transition"" rating confirms that the airport fully offsets direct carbon emissions from its operations and is working with its partners to reduce indirect emissions. BUD says it has set a long-term absolute emissions reduction target, developed a stakeholder partnership scheme and established a Carbon Management Plan in line with Paris Agreement targets, including a reduction pathway to achieving these targets.

The operator says it has added new elements to the measurement of indirect carbon emissions from the activities of companies operating at Budapest Airport, in addition to reducing its own emissions.

This includes taking into account information on the materials used for de-icing aircraft, roads, taxiways, and aprons, the amount of fuel used by subcontractors during construction and development works, and the routes and the treatment of waste and wastewater.

Measurements also include the total amount of fuel supplied to airlines and mapping the commuting habits of airport staff. The resulting comprehensive analysis will help Budapest Airport further reduce its environmental impact, together with its partners, and achieve the net zero emissions target set by ACI by 2035.

""As a responsible airport operator, we are convinced that rapid action is needed to protect the environment and integrate sustainable practices into our daily operations,"" says Kam Jandu, CEO of Budapest Airport.

""Achieving level 4+ ""Transition"" confirms that, with a consistent strategy, combined with a passionate and knowledgeable team, the airport is able to fulfill its essential operations in a more sustainable way. The next step will be to achieve ACI Airport Carbon Accreditation level 5, which will mean attaining net zero emissions, and we aim to realize this by 2035 at the latest,"" Jandu adds.

Budapest Airport says it is continuously expanding its fleet of electric vehicles and developing its e-charging infrastructure, encouraging its partner companies to take up e-mobility. Some 96 charging points are available for EVs, and more than 130 units of electric ground service equipment are already performing their tasks at the airport daily.

EV charging is also available for passengers; there are already 35 charging points in public car parks. From January 2023, 100% of the airport's total electricity consumption is covered by renewable energy sources, and work is underway to develop a 7.5 MW solar farm and to prepare the development of a geothermal heating system for the airport.

To date, the company says it has reduced its direct carbon emissions by more than 70% over the last 10 years and has also performed exceptionally well in waste management, recycling 73% of its municipal and packaging waste in 2023, more than double the rate of the population. The company also reduced its natural gas consumption by 22% in one year.

Olivier Jankovec, the director general of ACI Europe, emphasized: ""BUD is the first airport in Central Europe to reach this level of carbon management maturity, and [...] the airport is also clearly a leader in terms of climate action at a global level. Hats off to the entire team for this significant achievement.""

Gergely Gulyás, the head of the Prime Minister's Office, said there was ""full agreement"" among the parties involved in the state's planned purchase of Budapest Airport, fielding questions at a regular press briefing on April 25, according to state news agency MTI. As there are many players involved, as well as the matter of ""complicated corporate protocols,"" bringing the transaction to a close could take ""some days, weeks or possibly months, but let's hope it's rather days or weeks,"" Gulyás said. Hungary's government has raised hundreds of millions of euros from the sale of state assets to finance the purchase of a controlling stake in Budapest Airport. The European Commission authorized the acquisition by state-owned Corvinus International Investment and France's Vinci Airports in December.

Three new flights will be launched between Hungary and China this summer, meaning seven major Chinese cities will be directly accessible from Budapest, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó announced in Beijing on April 24, according to index.hu. The minister said the twice-a-week flights land in Shenzhen, in the southern Guangdong Province. ""This means that, from June onwards, seven Chinese cities will be accessible by direct flights from Budapest, increasing the number of flights to 19 per week, which is one and a half times more than before COVID and much more than any other Central European airport or city,"" the minister pointed out. On April 23, Szijjártó announced that Xi'an, which has a population of around 13 million and is the capital of the northwestern Shaanxi Province, would also be directly accessible from Budapest, according to origo.hu. Direct Budapest flights already operate to Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Ningbo, while a fifth connecting the capital with Guangzhou will also launch in June.

In March, 1,296,509 passengers used Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport, 21.7% more than in the same period last year and 10.5% more than in March 2019, operator Budapest Airport announced. The airport handled more than 3.4 million passengers in Q1, exceeding the record year before the pandemic by 10.2%. The increase in passenger numbers is slightly ahead of the company's forecast that total annual passenger traffic will easily surpass the previous record of 16.2 million by the end of 2024. The airport also handled 23,720 tonnes of air cargo in March, 40.7% more than in March 2023, exceeding the strongest month ever for cargo, November 2023, when 22,206 tonnes of cargo was processed. A total of 61,940 tonnes of cargo was handled at Budapest Airport in the first quarter of 2024, 39.6% more than in the same period last year. The airport is forecast to handle up to 240,000 tonnes of cargo by the end of the year, marking another record year.",bbj.hu,news,Budapest Business Journal,,0.0980392156862746,453161373,4,https://bbj.hu/uploads/banners/20245/bar_8835-OK.jpg,

A dam that supplies drinking water near a major city could be used to cool a reactor should Australia embrace nuclear power.

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is expected to use his upcoming Budget in Reply speech to provide more detail on potential sites for nuclear reactors, with the Coalition arguing Australia cannot solely rely on renewable energy to meet its climate change targets.

Nuclear for Climate Australia has been endorsed by Coalition MPs and its founder, a disillusioned former Labor candidate, is now advising the Opposition on nuclear energy policy.

It has recommended the future conversion of decommissioned coal-fired power stations into nuclear reactors - a policy idea Mr Dutton has recently backed.

The group has also suggested 13 potential sites for a nuclear reactor, including the Wivenhoe Dam 80km north-west of Brisbane that supplies south-east Queensland with its drinking water, along with several sites in suburban Brisbane and Ipswich.

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is expected to use his upcoming Budget reply speech to provide more detail on potential sites for nuclear reactors, with the Coalition arguing Australia can't solely rely on renewable energy to meet its climate change targets

Nuclear plants use the process of fission - splitting atoms - to heat water from the dam to create steam, which powers a turbine that creates electricity.

The dam's water would also be used to cool down the nuclear system, with the water then recirculated back into the reactor.

'While recirculating systems don't add heat to the river or lake, they do consume water through evaporation,' Nuclear for Climate Australia said.

Nuclear for Climate Australia's founder Robert Parker is a civil engineer of 37 years who is now advising the Coalition, despite running as a Labor candidate in 2007

'In Australia the availability of sizeable inland rivers are limited though a number of large reservoirs such as Wivenhoe Dam provide a substantial resource for fresh water cooling.'

Wivenhoe Dam has been a pumped hydro storage hydroelectric power station since 1984, providing 570 megawatts or 570million watts of power.

Nuclear for Climate Australia's founder Robert Parker is a civil engineer of 37 years with a masters in nuclear science who has supervised the construction of dams in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, along with Vietnam, Iran and Eritrea.

He said Wivenhoe Dam offered cooling qualities during a drought.

'You need to ensure that you got sufficient water in the highest demand, hot periods when everyone's got their air conditioners going, you do not want your plant losing cooling ability,' Mr Parker told Daily Mail Australia.

'Smaller nuclear power plants would need to be able to get an allocation of water, particularly in the hot-weather periods out of those dams to cool themselves.

'If the water allocation can be given to the power station, it would be a phenomenally good resource for cooling a nuclear power plant.'

This site was one of 10 'probable' sites in Queensland along with another three 'possible' sites in the home state of Mr Dutton and the Coalition's energy spokesman Ted O'Brien.

Opponents of nuclear power argue it is too risky to put a plant near any population centre because of the risk of meltdown, even though nuclear medical isotopes for cancer treatment are produced at Lucas Heights in suburban Sydney.

The meltdown at the Soviet-era Chernobyl plant in Ukraine in 1986 resulted in a mass leakage of radiation that devastated surrounding areas for decades, while the effects of the 2011 earthquake on the Fukushima plant in Japan also caused a major radiation event.

Other possible nuclear power plant sites

Nuclear for Climate's 13 recommended potential reactor sites include seven existing coal-fired power stations: Callide, Stanwell, Tarong, Gladstone, Millmeran, Kogan Creek and Collinsville, along with gas-fired Swanbank in suburban Ipswich.

'In Queensland coal fired plants were constructed adjacent to available coal mines and other infrastructure,' it said.

'New nuclear plants will where possible take advantage of the resource used for cooling at these plants.'

Mr Dutton has flagged the idea of potentially converting five disused coal-fired power stations into nuclear energy reactors, arguing Australia could not entirely rely on wind and solar energy to meet its target of net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

The Coalition argues the existence of electricity transmission lines from these sites meant nuclear power could be delivered affordably - unlike Labor's $20billion Rewiring the Nation plan.

Nuclear for Climate Australia has been endorsed by Liberal Party politicians and has previously suggested converting disused coal-fired power stations into nuclear reactors - a policy idea Mr Dutton has recently endorsed. It has also listed 10 'probable' sites in Queensland

'If there's a retiring coal asset, so there's a coal fired generator that's already got an existing distribution network, the wires and poles are already there to distribute the energy across the network into homes and businesses, that's really what we're interested in,' the Opposition Leader told Seven's Sunrise program on March 5.

'The latest technology means that you can switch off old coal assets and start with a firming capacity that means that we can have cheaper prices, it means that we can have reliable energy, it means that we can keep the Australian jobs because, at the moment, manufacturing is going offshore because they simply can't afford to stay here.'

Nuclear for Climate has also suggested Ross River in north Queensland, the existing site of a solar farm near Townsville that is also close to the sea.

The three 'possible' sites included Stockleigh in suburban Logan south of Brisbane, Samsonvale west of Brisbane, and the Burdekin regional in north Queensland.

Mr Parker compiled that list in 2022 but since then he has revised it to drop two sites too far inland, citing droughts.

'Subsequent research since 2022 has meant I have become less confident that small nuclear power plants can be adequately cooled in Queensland in high demand, hot dry periods,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'In the absence of more thorough analysis I will probably drop the Kogan Creek and Millmerran sites and reduce the number of plants at Tarong I think a greater reliance on coastal locations with sea water cooling is required as well as greater reliance on places like Ross River and the Burdekin.'

Nuclear advocacy group

Nuclear for Climate was influential within Coalition circles even before Mr Dutton in March revealed a government led by him would push for a nuclear power industry.

Mr Parker, who ran as a New South Wales state Labor candidate in 2007, said he was now providing advice to the federal Coalition.

'I'm assisting the Coalition parties with technical advice and work,' he said.

'I'm pretty deeply embedded with them.'

In 2022, he addressed the Parliamentary Friends of Nuclear Industries, chaired by Nationals backbencher David Gillespie.

Coalition senators in 2022 also cited Mr Parker in their dissenting report on the government's plan for Australia to source 82 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.

Hollie Hughes, Ross Cadell and Bridget McKenzie wrote their report as members of a Senate environment and communications committee who opposed the Climate Change Bill 2022, which Labor and the Greens backed.

Mr Parker's Nuclear for Climate group had made a submission to this bill arguing Australia could not rely on renewable energy for power generation.

'Society cannot be held hostage to the vagaries of the weather,' it said.

'The risks of failure with randomly variable power sources are so high, and their environmental toll so great, that we must embrace a sustainable large scale roll out of nuclear energy.'

Mr Parker has also been endorsed in Parliament by Liberal MP Rick Wilson.

In November 2022, the backbencher from Western Australia hailed his expertise on small modular reactors that can produce 300 megawatts, or 300million watts of power.

'Speakers like Robert Parker, founder of Nuclear for Climate Australia, described the journey of Canada's expanding nuclear power using SMR technology,' he said.

While the Liberal Party is open to establishing a nuclear industry in Australia, Labor and the Greens are resolutely opposed, preferring less reliable renewable energy sources to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (pictured is the Tihange nuclear power plant in Belgium)

'As a Commonwealth cousin with similar culture, laws, physical landscape and federated political system, Canada presents an opportunity to collaborate on energy systems for climate change mitigation.

'Today, energy prices for families in Canada are close to half the price Australians are paying.'

No country in the world, however, has small modular reactors yet, with Canada not expected to have this technology until the late 2020s, when Ontario's state-run power company installs a reactor designed by General Electric and Hitachi.

Rolls Royce is developing SMR technology so a series of units the size of shipping containers could be manufactured in a factory and transported to a site.

But conventional, large-scale reactors have been commercially proven, with the United Arab Emirates setting up a new reactor at Barakah in 2020 with South Korean technology after eight years of construction work.

A review commissioned by former prime minister John Howard in 2006 concluded establishing nuclear power plants would take at least a decade.

Rolls Royce is developing SMR technology so a series of units the size of shipping containers could be manufactured in a factory and transported to a site

Former Telstra chief executive Ziggy Switkowski, a trained nuclear physicist, in his 2006 review, concluded nuclear power is 'between 20 and 50 per cent more costly to produce than power from a new coal-fired plant at current fossil fuel prices in Australia'.

He modelled a scenario where the deployment of nuclear power that started in 2020 'could see 25 reactors producing about a third of the nation's electricity by 2050 (a position already surpassed by France, South Korea, Sweden, Belgium, Bulgaria and Hungary, among others)'.

While the Liberal Party is open to establishing a nuclear industry in Australia, Labor and the Greens are resolutely opposed, preferring less reliable and heavily subsidised renewable energy sources.

Mr Parker, who ran unsuccessfully as a Labor candidate in 2007 in the state seat of Goulburn, is no longer an ALP member, because of the party's position against nuclear power.

'It's the biggest disaster of all time, the ALP's policy is a shocker,' he said.

'Politics has often got nothing much to do with what's good for the nation - can you command the votes?

'It's a cynical game. The flea on the tail wags the dog and the flea is the Greens in the inner city; Labor's got to hold the Greens off by being anti-nuke.'",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,0.1686274509803922,453132672,7,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/08/05/84595663-0-image-a-25_1715143111423.jpg,eng-9557026

In Hungary, the mandatory structural and pressure test at the age of 10 has already been abolished, but a tank inspection must be carried out every four years and a tank certificate issued, which must be presented during the technical examination. The gas safety inspection certificate is a mandatory part of the technical inspection and must not be older than 30 days from the inspection date. In Europe, the number of CNG wells has skyrocketed in recent years

and most of them operate in the capital. The excise tax on compressed natural gas was increased from 0 to 28 percent at the beginning of 2015, so the price of this fuel is already higher than gasoline, at an average of HUF 794 per kilo.

4. The cheapest alternative: Liquefied gas (average price: 345 HUF/kg)

Liquid propane-butane gas (LPG) consists of propane, butane, propylene, isobutane, isobutylene, butylene and their mixtures. It has almost the same composition as household LPG, but may contain fewer impurities, hydrogen sulfide and no water at all. They are obtained practically as a by-product of refining extracted hydrocarbons. It does not contain harmful components such as benzene, which are found in gasoline. It is liquid at normal temperatures and although the consumption values are higher compared to conventional fuels, overall significant savings can be achieved in operation. According to laboratory results

LPG is a much more accessible autogas than CNG: not only can it be purchased in many more places (574), but it is also much cheaper in Hungary. Compared to traditional gasoline and diesel vehicles, LPG vehicles have many advantages, but consumption is not one of them: such vehicles

However, it is still worth using LPG as the average price for LPG is just over half that of petrol. The disadvantage, however, is that in some underground car parks it is forbidden to drive with a LPG without a safety valve in some underground car parks where there is a sign prohibiting this, and that the inspection is more expensive and usually takes place after 10:00 a.m. The liquid gas tank can no longer be used become.

Today, unfortunately, Dacia is the only car brand that offers a factory-fitted LPG kit for its cars with unchanged warranty conditions. Since 2009, the Romanian brand has sold almost a million new gasoline-powered cars in Europe. With the converted Dacias you only have to do without the spare wheel, otherwise the size of the trunk does not change and the range increases to 1,200 km if you add the petrol and gas modes. In Hungary, the vehicle registration document must state whether a car has dual operation. Retrofitting is not cheap, for an average four-cylinder engine it is worth counting HUF 4,000 to 500,000, including the cost of the new technical inspection, but the investment will pay off even after 15,000 to 20,000 km.

5. Demand is increasing rapidly: Electricity (70-289 HUF/kWh)

By the end of April 2024, there were already more than 55,000 pure electric cars and more than 40,000 plug-in hybrid/range extender electric cars in circulation in Hungary

Nowadays, an average of 7 out of 300 cars with Hungarian license plates have green license plates (95,000 out of 4.1 million), but this proportion is gradually increasing.

In 2023, Hungary produced 34,895 GWh of electricity, 2.4 percent less than the previous year. Last year we imported almost 9 percent less, 11.1 GWh of electricity, so imports accounted for 24.1 percent of our consumption, which is a slight change from the ratio in 2022 (25.6 percent). According to sources, nuclear energy ranks first in Hungarian electricity production (45.6 percent), followed by fossil (28.8 percent) and renewable energies (25.5 percent). Last year, solar energy capacities were expanded at a record pace, so that weather-dependent renewable energies already supplied 20 percent of domestic production (of which 18.2 percent were solar systems, 1.8 percent were wind turbines), i.e. about the same as gas power plants.

Direct current (DC) charging is known to be the fastest and most expensive way to charge an electric car. In Hungary, 1 kWh of electricity costs an average of HUF 245 at public charging stations, HUF 183 at Tesla Superchargers and HUF 289 at Mol Plugee. It should be noted that electrical energy is not considered fuel and is therefore not subject to excise tax.

In this case you only have to pay 70 HUF for 1 kWh. On the other hand, only 2-3 kW of power can be obtained from a normal socket, but with a wall charger (wallbox) a charging power of 7.4, 11 or even 22 kW is available, with the latter you can charge an average capacity of an electric car within two hours to 10-80 percent. According to domestic surveys, more than half of owners of cars that can be charged from a socket charge their car at home. Many of them have also installed solar panels on their homes, which is the most environmentally friendly solution.

6. The music of the future: hydrogen

Hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine cars are still in the experimental phase, but there are three fuel cell cars in the world that require hydrogen refueling: the Toyota Mirai, the Hyundai Nexo and the Honda CRV e:FCEV. Due to their extremely expensive technology, they are only produced in small series and instead of buying them, you can usually only lease them. Typically in countries where there are gas stations that sell hydrogen. Fortunately, Hungary is already one of them almost three years after its introduction

which can serve buses and trucks with a pressure of 350 bar as well as cars with a pressure of 700 bar.

From chemistry lessons at school we know the splitting of water (electrolysis), in which hydrogen and oxygen are produced from the liquid using electric current. In the hydrogen fuel cell, the exact opposite happens: the gaseous hydrogen stored under high pressure reacts with the oxygen in the air with the help of a proton-permeable membrane; the chemical reaction produces electric current and water. The electrical energy generated in the car is used to drive a fuel cell electric car that does not carry a battery but hydrogen. A serious advantage over a purely electric car is the fast charging, the long range and the low weight.

The fact that the MOL Group handed over the largest plant for the development of green hydrogen in the East-Central European region in Százhalombatta on April 11 of this year also contributes to the spread of hydrogen as a fuel in Hungary. Thanks to the 22 million euro investment, the plant will be able to develop 1,600 tons of hydrogen per year using electrical energy from renewable sources in a CO2-neutral manner. The 10 MW plant not only reduces Dunai Finomító's carbon dioxide emissions by 25,000 tons, but also opens a new chapter in the domestic and regional H2 economy.",newsbeezer.com,news,newsbeezer.com,,0.1529411764705881,453120635,35,,

An ""ironclad"" friendship in Belgrade, ""the best [friendship] in history"" in Budapest... The Chinese president used superlatives to gratify his hosts, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who rolled out the red carpet for him and hung Chinese flags everywhere in their capitals.

While the French leg of the trip, from Sunday May 5 to Tuesday May 7, highlighted, despite its cordial tone, the accumulation of disputes between China and the European Union, from subsidies to the vehicle industry electricity until Xi's ever-increasing support. for Vladimir Putin, the rest of the trip should show, on the contrary, that Beijing does indeed have allies in Europe.

What Vucic and Orban have in common is their pronounced anti-Western rhetoric, their country's democratic backsliding and their stormy relations with the EU, even though Serbia is not yet a member. ""Our voice, the voice of Hungary, is the only voice in Europe,"" Orban acknowledged Thursday in a statement to the press alongside Xi, arguing that ""one of the pillars of [the] the new world order is the Republic of China. ""

In Serbia and Hungary, Xi heard no criticism, testifying to a jubilant relationship far from the complaints expressed in Paris regarding his trade policy. The relationship with Hungary has been elevated to the rank of ""ironclad comprehensive strategic partnership"", thus placing it among Beijing's most valued. Numerous sectoral cooperation agreements have been signed: ""26"" in Belgrade, ""18"" in Budapest.

Their content remains quite vague, but there has been talk, particularly in Serbia, of developing cooperation between Serbian and Chinese media, while Brussels has been calling for years on this Balkan country to improve its press freedom if it wants to join to the EU. In Hungary, new railway projects were discussed in addition to the railway line between Belgrade and Budapest currently under construction by China and, for the first time, cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.

However, contrary to expectations, no concrete investments have been announced, even though Chinese companies have invested heavily in both countries in recent years. With this double visit, Xi has above all succeeded in showing Brussels that he is counting on these two capitals to curb possible reprisals against his economic policy.

We are creating a favorable environment for IT companies and launching a Zero Risk program to cover all risks associated with opening and running offices in Uzbekistan,"" he said.

At the round table ""Connections: Revival of the Great Silk Road"", international experts and representatives of state bodies explored opportunities to expand ties, economic cooperation and cultural exchange along the ancient routes of the Silk Road.

At the roundtable ""Integrated Urban Planning: Quality Investments, Comfort for Environment and People"", leading urbanists, architects and representatives of the business community discussed approaches to the development of the city of Tashkent. In particular, BCG Managing Director and Senior Partner Vladislav Butenko emphasized the importance of integrating innovative solutions into urban planning to achieve sustainable urban development. He emphasized that both economic and social aspects should be taken into account in integrated planning, ensuring a balance between them.

The Forum has played an important role in attracting investments for various ministries and regions of Uzbekistan. The agreements signed demonstrate the development of key sectors such as industry, energy, pharmaceuticals and automobile manufacturing.

One of the main achievements of the forum was the agreement between the Ministry of Digital Technologies, the Ministry of Energy and IT company Data Volt on the construction of a data center based on ""green"" technologies. Experts noted the importance of such projects for Uzbekistan. Minister of Investment, Industry and Trade Laziz Kudratov and Data Volt director Rajit Nanda took part in the signing ceremony.

The III International Investment Forum in Tashkent has come to an end, but the planned initiatives and signed agreements promise active work on attracting investments and ensuring sustainable development. Uzbekistan has reaffirmed its role as a strategic partner in the international arena, attracting the attention of global investors and contributing to the economic growth of the region.

The agreement was one of 18 covering a wide variety of areas signed during President Xi Jinping's visit to Hungary on Thursday.

A joint statement issued by the two countries on the establishing of an over-arching All-Weather Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for the New Era, said: ""The Chinese side will continue to encourage capable Chinese enterprises to invest in Hungary. The two sides will promote orderly cooperation in emerging fields including clean energy, artificial intelligence, mobile communication technology and nuclear energy and technology.""

Hungary's President Viktor Orban said, after his talks with the Chinese president: ""The Hungarians have serious ambitions. The previous 100 years, the 20th Century, was a shameful one for Hungary. It was a century in which we lost, a century in which we suffered extremely heavy losses of historic proportions. And the concept driving the Hungarians is that we want to win the 21st Century, and not lose it. And to win we need partners, investors, trading partners and the world's most advanced technology.""

He added: ""I will make special mention of something which is not only an economic fact, but also an expression of confidence: the fact that we can extend our cooperation to the whole spectrum of the nuclear industry, where up until now there has been no cooperation between our two countries. This holds great potential, because in this respect - in terms of the nuclear industry - Hungary has considerable international experience and prestige, as we have been involved in this industry for more than 50 years, and currently the largest nuclear development in Europe is taking place in Hungary.

""Our plan is that by the beginning of the next decade the share of Hungary's energy provided by nuclear power will be between 60 and 70 per cent.""

In the text of his published remarks, President Xi said the two countries would ""connect our development strategies more closely, deepen economic, trade, investment, and financial cooperation, and advance the Budapest-Belgrade railway and other key projects. We will expand cooperation in emerging industries and foster new quality productive forces to empower and facilitate economic and social development of the two countries"".

The official statements and publications during the visit do not yet appear to include detail of the content of the memorandum of understanding on nuclear. China is the fastest growing generator of nuclear energy. According to World Nuclear Association figures, it currently has 56 operable reactors with a capacity of 54 GW - and it has 27 more reactors under construction which would provide 28.9 GW more capacity. Hungary currently has four operable nuclear reactors with a capacity of 1.9 GW, supplying about 40% of the country's electricity. It has also embarked on the Paks II project which would see Russia's Rosatom supply two VVER-1200 reactors.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.3725490196078431,453052606,26,,

However, the initiative still has to overcome several energy challenges such as upgrading the outdated infrastructure, ensuring a fair and inclusive transition to a low-carbon economy, harmonizing the legal frameworks among the member states, and meeting the EU's high climate standards. During the political transition, these countries prioritized economic and political reforms over energy challenges. In the 1990s, only the Western countries, thus those outside the Eastern bloc, made significant progress in the energy sector. The production of a unit of GDP in many countries of the Three Seas Initiative has been more costly than in Western Europe. Therefore, these states are striving to align their economic and energy policies with the EU standards.

The Three Seas region is a group of countries that vary in geography, climate, economy, and economic resources. Each of them uses different sources of energy and emits different amounts of greenhouse gases. To show how diverse the Three Seas region is, let us look at some of the countries in this group. Lithuania relies mainly on gas, biofuels, and renewables, and seeks to diversify its energy sources. It has no intention to build nuclear plants shortly, though. similarly, Estonia's parliament adopted a renewable electricity target of 100 percent by 2030. Contrary to what it may seem, Hungary's energy system has a relatively low carbon intensity. The country relies on coal for only about a dozen or so of its energy mix. State plan authorities to increase their use of renewable energy sources and invest in new nuclear reactors at the Paks power plant. Hungary increased its solar power capacity by nearly 1 gigawatt in 2022. The Czech Republic is also phasing out coal and expanding its nuclear energy sector to secure its energy independence.

The Three Seas countries and other Central and Eastern European nations are undergoing a fast energy transition, driven by the EU's stricter climate policy. Diversifying energy sources became more important after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. As the Kremlin's influence in the region has weakened over the past two years, energy prices have risen, especially for fossil fuels that were once largely imported from the east. One thing is certain: the region is undergoing a transformation that will involve reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

The region has a lot of scope for developing renewable technologies, even though coal and gas have been and are still the main sources of energy for many of its economies. Offshore wind power plants are very feasible for the countries on the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Northern countries like Poland and the Baltic states can invest in both offshore and onshore energy, even though they use different types of energy sources. Conversely, countries like Slovenia, Romania, and Hungary, which are situated in the central-southern region of the Three Seas, are known for their significant potential in producing solar energy. The advancement of renewable energy sources is crucial for the Three Seas Initiative because it can help mitigate the continuous increase in energy costs. In the journey of energy transition, particularly for economies heavily reliant on coal, gas serves as an excellent bridge fuel. This is evident from the investments made by countries in the region, such as the doubling of the LNG terminal capacity in Croatia, the construction of the FSRU terminal near Gdańsk, and the expansion of the Polish LNG terminal's capacity from 5 to 8.3 billion cubic meters annually.

Without a doubt, the year 2030 will be a significant milestone for Europe in terms of both political and climate-related developments. In the political sphere, there is a growing discussion within the EU forum about plans to extend the union by incorporating a country from the Western Balkans. In terms of climate and energy policies, 2030 marks the completion of certain frameworks established by the European Union. Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that within a strict framework, certain countries may struggle to meet their individual objectives. Indeed, if we expand our view beyond just the Three Seas countries, and if the economic and energy development in Central and Eastern Europe continues at its current pace, with transformations that are equitable and customized to each economy, we could anticipate a significant increase in the capacity of wind and solar power plants in this region. The capacity could rise from the current 35 gigawatts to 196 gigawatts by 2030. This increase could potentially reduce energy prices by up to a third and enable the export of up to 20 gigawatts of electricity post-2030. In 2022 alone, the total capacity of solar and wind power plants in Central and Eastern Europe saw an increase of less than 30 percent. This suggests a potential for this trend to continue, further contributing to the region's energy development and transformation.

There is a clear political desire for transformation within the energy sector in the countries involved in the Three Seas Initiative. It is important to note that in the Central and Eastern European region, political support is significantly influenced by energy prices. This, in turn, affects the stance of individual governments towards investments in the energy sector. The Baltic states have set a goal to disconnect their energy systems from the Russian grid by 2025. Following this, they plan to subsequently connect to the continental European grid. Indeed, Latvia and Estonia are also participating in the development of offshore wind farms. Another noteworthy example is the collaboration between Hungary and Romania, along with Azerbaijan and Georgia. They have signed a memorandum to develop an underwater electric cable that will run through the Black Sea. The investment is intended to bolster the export of energy to Europe. Hungary is a country that has significant geothermal potential. As a testament to this, the first geothermal power plant was connected to their national grid in late 2017. An excellent illustration of future collaboration is the proposal by Romania and Bulgaria to construct a shared energy island. For Poland, which has an economy heavily reliant on coal, there have been numerous investments and strategies developed in recent years. The goal of these initiatives is to achieve energy independence and ensure a stable supply of natural gas to the Central and Eastern Europe region. Several significant projects stand out, including the Baltic Pipe, the enlargement of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście, the introduction of a new FSRU terminal, the development of nuclear reactors in collaboration with the United States and South Korea, and the implementation of small modular reactors (SMRs).

The success of the energy transition not only relies on top-down decisions but also significantly depends on the collaborative efforts of the private sector, the public sector, and the general public. An excellent illustration of public involvement is the widespread support for the ""My Electricity"" government program in Poland. The initiative aimed to offer a co-funding sum of as much as PLN 5,000 for the setup of solar panel systems in domestic houses. The considerable interest shown by the beneficiaries led to the construction of close to 10 gigawatts of photovoltaic energy between 2020 and 2023.

The partnership within the Three Seas Initiative is consistently progressing and it is undeniably a framework that deserves consideration, especially in the light of the current geopolitical system. Moving forward, the significance of investments in interconnectors cannot be overstated. Such investments will facilitate the delivery of electricity, produced from offshore wind energy at sea, to areas of demand. This calls for, among other initiatives, the deployment of bridging systems and the expansion of cross-border networks to harness the advantages. In addition, the transition of many countries to nuclear energy can benefit others. This is because nuclear power stations in a particular country can have a substantial impact on the regional energy composition, especially through grid interconnections.

Source: wyborcza.pl

The Poles have resumed the border blockade with Ukraine at the Dovhobychuv-Uhryniv checkpoint. However, they are expected to rally only on May 10. The protest is part of another large-scale action of Polish farmers demanding to cancel the European ""green course"" requirements and ban imports of agricultural products from Ukraine.

The State Customs Service announced the blocking of the border. It noted that the announced time of the rally is from 09.00 to 16.00.

""According to the Polish side, today, May 10, from 09:00 to 16:00, a one-day strike will be held in front of the Dolhobyczów-Uhryniv checkpoint in the cargo areas: entry and exit from Ukraine,"" the statement said.

It is emphasized that the protesters do not plan to touch the cars, as they must move freely. As well as buses.

Poles protest not only on the border of Ukraine

On May 10, mass protests took place in the Polish capital Warsaw. Farmers plan to continue the rallies until late in the evening.

According to Radio Svoboda, the protesting farmers claim that the consequences of the ""green course"" will lead to higher electricity and heating prices. They also oppose the upcoming ban on gasoline and diesel cars.

In addition to rejecting the Green Deal, the strikers are demanding a ban on imports of agricultural products from Ukraine. In their opinion, Ukrainian products are allegedly not controlled and do not have certificates, although this is not true.

The border has been unblocked since the end of April

Polish farmers fully unblocked all checkpoints on the border with Ukraine on April 29, when the blockade of the Rava-Ruska-Hrebenne checkpoint was lifted. At the same time, the parties agreed to exchange monthly figures on the transit of agricultural products to monitor the situation.

At the same time, the complete de-blockade of the border already yielded positive results. For example:

Poland receives much more from Ukraine than it gives

Danylo Hetmantsev (""Servant of the People""), Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Finance, Taxation and Customs Policy, noted earlier that by blocking the border, the Poles are ""shooting themselves in the foot"" - after all, in 2023 Poland exported $12.3 billion worth of goods to Ukraine and imported $6.6 billion from Ukraine.

""According to the Polish State Statistics Service, in 2023, Ukraine accounted for 3.2% of all merchandise exports from Poland. According to this indicator, we were in 7th place among our trading partners, overtaking the United States and such EU members as Spain, Slovakia, and Hungary. At the same time, the dynamics of growth of Polish exports to Ukraine in 2023 was the highest among the top ten countries that are the largest trading partners,"" the MP emphasized.

Moreover, he noted, the actual balance of trade with Poland for Ukraine is much more negative than it is evident from official statistics - ""due to underestimation of imports."" While Ukraine, ""according to their statistics, is a bigger partner for Poland as an importing country.""

""In the case of blocking automobile customs crossings, this is a real shot in the foot. Because our bilateral trade in general is already more profitable for Poland, especially given the current asymmetric restrictions on our agricultural exports (where we have already agreed to compromises),"" the MP stated.",eng.obozrevatel.com,news,Obozrevatel,,-0.1294117647058823,453043034,1,https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/5/10/blokada-polscha-wyborcza-pl.jpg?size=2010x1050,eng-9562610

Ukrenergo said Ukraine planned to import 13,904 megawatt hours (Mwh) of electricity on Friday versus 16,699 Mwh on Thursday.

It said in a statement that Ukraine received emergency power aid from EU countries in the morning, and during the day it expects to import electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova.

Ukrainian officials have said the country has lost about 80% of its thermal power generation, relying increasingly on the three nuclear power plants that produce about 60% of its electricity.

Thermal and hydro-electric power generation are needed to keep supply and demand balanced during the peak hours of energy consumption in the morning and evening.

As the garage door opened, the headlights illuminated a horrific scene - the bludgeoned body of his wife, 33-year-old model Christine Demeter.

The crime made headlines across Canada and well beyond, launching an investigation by police and prosecutors. Shortly, they would uncover the sordid and seedy dealings of one of the country's darkest and most dangerous psychopathic minds.

The ensuing trial for Peter Demeter was one of the longest in Canada's history, as prosecutors laid out their evidence, painting a picture of an unhappy marriage, a mistress and a plot to cash in a recently acquired $1-million life insurance policy.

The crimes of Peter Demeter, which began with his wife's death but certainly didn't end there, happened more than 50 years ago, but remain some of the most gruesome and calculated in our nation's history.

Now, Global's true crime offering, Crime Beat, is looking back on the case for its 100th episode, with new interviews from the detectives who responded to the grisly scene, never-before-heard details from witnesses who were there the night Christine died and local journalists who have followed every twisted turn in Peter's criminal life.

Read on to learn more about this fascinating case and to get a sneak peek of some of the new information highlighted in Crime Beat's centennial episode.

Peter Demeter was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1933 to a wealthy family.

His family's fortune, however, was ravaged by World War II and Peter lost both his father and brother in the war.

In 1956, in an effort to leave his grief-stricken life behind, he emigrated to Canada at the age of 23, ready to make it big and win back the lifestyle he had always dreamed of.

""(Peter) learned that you had to concentrate everything, whether it was cheating, lying or stealing, to get food and survive. And that was the world he grew up in,"" says journalist Barbara Amiel, author of By Persons Unknown: The Strange Death of Christine Demeter, explaining Peter's mindset as a young man, and the ethos that would come to shape the rest of his life.

He brought with him to Canada his beautiful girlfriend, Christine Ferrari, an Austrian-born model, whom he had met behind the scenes on an Austrian movie set.

After several years, Peter had carved out a successful career as a developer in Toronto, and in 1967 he and Christine wed.

From the outside, the early days of their marriage appeared to be a happy time. They welcomed a daughter into the world and in 1971, they built their dream house -- complete with a giant fireplace and swimming pool -- on a quiet dead-end street in Mississauga, overlooking the Credit River.

That daughter, Andrea, was just three-and-a-half years old when she sat inside their upscale home on July 18, 1973, watching television, unaware that her mother was being bludgeoned to death inside the garage.

Christine was found by her husband, lying face down in a pool of her own blood, her head crushed.

""There was so much trauma to her head, we couldn't see her face clearly but I could actually see some brain matter,"" Det. William Koeslag, now retired, of the Mississauga Police Department recounts in Crime Beat's upcoming episode detailing the case.

An autopsy would later show that she died from blunt force trauma to the head, likely from the use of a crowbar, hammer or tire iron.

A weapon was never discovered. But, standing inside the garage that night, police immediately knew something was amiss.

Despite Peter's airtight alibi (he had been at a nearby shopping mall with houseguests at the time of Christine's death), police noticed he was acting a bit strange for someone who just learned their spouse was dead.

""The first thing he said to me was: 'Why can't you get her out of here?'"" remembers retired Det. Barry King, one of the first officers from Mississauga Police to arrive on the scene.

""I didn't know if he was the culprit, the victim, or whatever.""

Police also noticed several other odd things happening around Christine's body in the garage -- they found the keys to her Cadillac on the front seat of the car, the car's battery had been drained and the garage door's automatic opener had been dislocated, preventing it from opening without manual effort.

Investigators quickly got to work, unearthing a trove of details from neighbours, friends and family members that pointed to a marriage unravelling.

A neighbour revealed to police that Christine had given her two airline tickets she had found, one for Peter and one for another woman, asking the neighbour to hold onto them for safekeeping.

Police also found love letters between Peter and an old Austrian flame, model Marina Hundt, leading them to believe he had rekindled the relationship and was having an affair.

In interviews with police, Peter himself admitted this marriage had been on thin ice and police eventually unearthed $1-million life insurance policies the couple had taken out shortly before Christine was killed.

Disguised as utility workers, police got to work installing wiretaps on the Demeter home, listening in as Peter told his best friend, Csaba Szilagy, about his rekindled affair with Hundt.

In a separate interview with police, Szilagy also told police that Peter has been plotting various ways to kill Christine, bandying about ideas of a hitman, shocking Christine with electricity in their backyard swimming pool or having her run over shotgun shells in an attempt to explode her car.

On Aug. 17, after a month of collecting a mountain of circumstantial evidence, police charged Peter with plotting Christine's murder.

Meanwhile, prosecutors began planning their strategy for the upcoming trial, which would last 11 weeks and reveal to the jury a spiralling marriage, a man desperate to be with his secret lover and all the possible ways Peter had conspired to off the mother of his child.

The jury heard how Peter and Christine became increasingly dissatisfied with each other in their six years of marriage, with anger, distrust and suspicion becoming common themes.

The jury learned about the affair with Hundt, who quickly became known in the press as ""The Other Woman,"" and who would often be seen outside the courthouse with Peter's dog, Beelzebub.

The trial got truly bizarre, however, when prosecutors brought in a witness with a bag over his head to protect his identity.

Mr. X (later identified as jailhouse informant Gyala Virag) testified that Peter had hired a hitman with the nickname ""The Duck"" to kill his wife. ""The Duck"" was later identified as petty criminal Imre Olejnyik.

Prosecutors also had Peter's former friend and informant, Szilagy, take the stand. Szilagy testified that Peter had tried to hire him to murder Christine, although he said he declined.

He also admitted that he knew Peter was seriously plotting the death of his wife just two days before she died, but said he didn't warn her.

Ultimately, the jury decided that Peter had ordered a hit on his wife and he was sentenced to life in prison on Dec. 6, 1974. Olejnyik, believed to be the hitman, died in Hungary before he could be extradited back to Canada to face charges for the murder of Christine.

It didn't stop there -- time behind bars didn't prevent Peter from trying to have more people killed.

In 1983, Peter was paroled and sent to live in a halfway house in Peterborough. That year, he was charged with arson in connection with a fire at his luxurious Mississauga home -- a fire that Peter tried to pin on Peel police, but it was ultimately found that Peter hired and paid another former inmate, Tony Preston, $8,000 to burn down the house.

Later that year, he was back in front of a judge for sentencing after plotting to murder his cousin's teenage son (the cousin had taken custody of Peter's daughter, Andrea, after Christine's death). The court found that Peter plotted, with the help of Preston and another former inmate, to have his nephew kidnapped in order to collect the ransom and then have the nephew killed. He was handed two new life sentences.

And, again, in 1985, he was wrapped up in another murder-for-hire scheme, this time for conspiring from behind prison walls to kidnap and kill the daughter of his lawyer, Toby Belman.

Apparently, Peter was unhappy with his lawyer's legal fees and angry that Belman had frozen some of his stock assets when Peter's $46,000 legal bill went unpaid. He cooked up a scheme to kidnap the teen girl and demand a $400,000 ransom.

The plot was foiled when Peter's former cellmate went to police and snitched. Again, he was sentenced to another two additional life sentences.

Judge John O'Driscoll, who sentenced Peter in 1988, openly called him evil.

""Your evil knows no bounds. It never rests. It never ends...Whether or not you are inherently evil, I do not know, but you ooze evil out of every pore and contaminate everyone around you,"" he said.

He also noted an unusual criminal character trait in Peter.

""If Peter Demeter is a psychopath, he has a unique feature. Instead of burning out as he gets older, he's getting worse.''

As the judge noted, Peter has shown he has a capacity for some truly dangerous behaviour, regardless of his status as an inmate or a free man.

He was eventually clinically labelled as a psychopath, diagnosed with narcissistic and antisocial features and deemed an indefinite risk to the public.

In 1999 he began to waive his own bi-annual parole hearing, conceding that he would likely remain in prison until his death.

Despite a heart attack, stroke and several bouts with cancer, all while behind bars, he continues to live and is now in his 90s.

In 2019 he apparently had a change of heart regarding being a free man, and tried his hand in front of the parole board for the first time in 20 years. Even as an 85-year-old, the parole board wasn't swayed.

""Your history of counselling others to seek revenge for you makes you more of a risk of recidivism than your age and physical ability to harm others would suggest,"" the panel said in its decision, according to documents obtained by Rob Tripp of Cancrime.

""It is the Board's opinion that you will present an undue risk to society if released.""

The board noted a ""less than stellar"" history of prison conduct, citing 40 incidents between 2013 and 2019.

The board also noted that Peter has taken hostile measures against his daughter, changing his will so that she will only receive one dollar when he dies.

Since late March, the Ukrainian energy sector has been the target of massive Russian missile and drone attacks, causing blackouts in many regions and raising the issue of decentralisation of generating capacity.

""We will definitely face challenges in the summer and these challenges will be primarily related to capacity shortages due to damage to power plants,"" Mr Volodymyr Kudrytskiy, the head of Ukrenergo grid operator, told a televised briefing.

""We realise that today is not the most difficult situation yet, we have not yet seen the real summer heat and air conditioning systems are not yet in use,"" Mr Kudrytskiy said.

He added that hydro-electric power plants can produce less electricity in the summer, when nuclear power plants also undergo regular mandatory repairs.

Ukrenergo said Ukraine planned to import 13,904 megawatt hours (Mwh) of electricity on May 10 versus 16,699 Mwh on May 9.

It said in a statement that Ukraine received emergency power aid from EU countries in the morning, and during the day it expects to import electricity from Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Moldova.

Ukrainian officials have said the country has lost about 80 per cent of its thermal power generation, relying increasingly on the three nuclear power plants that produce about 60 per cent of its electricity.

Prices in Hungary picked up slightly in April, after declining for more than a year; the annual inflation was 3.7% from an over 3-year low of 3.6% in the previous month, according to the Hungarian Central Statistical Office.

Compared to March, prices increased by 0.7%, easing from a 0.8% rise previously.

In a yearly comparison, services became 9.5% more expensive, within which rents were up by 14%. Motor fuel prices cost 6.6% more than a year ago, and 3.5% more than in the previous month.

On the other hand, household electricity, gas and other fuels became 4.5% cheaper. Alcoholic beverages and tobacco prices rose by 3.8%, pharmaceutical products became 7.3% more expensive.

Food inflation, which was one of the core drivers of the double-digit price increase in Hungary for the previous year, has recently lowered considerably, landing at 1% in April. Within this category, sugar prices rocketed by more than 30%, and chocolate and cocoa by 9.2%, but egg prices decreased by 20.3%, among others.

Annual core inflation, excluding volatile items such as food and energy prices, was 4.1% in April 2024 down from 4.4% in the previous month.

This figure is a key driver in the decision-making of the Hungarian National Bank (MNB), which has gradually started lowering the benchmark rate since October 2023.

According to MNB's latest forecast, the current decline in core inflation will stop in the second quarter of 2024 and it is expected to fluctuate between 4.5% and 5% for the rest of the year.

The MNB's medium-term inflation target is at 3%, beyond that, there is an additional 1% tolerance band.

Therefore, the gradual easing of Hungarian monetary conditions has continued in April, when the MNB cut its interest rate by 50 basis points to 7.75%. By the end of June, the market expects to see this rate at around 6.5-7%, however, analysis from ING warned that the pace of cuts could slow down.

Compared with March, prices rose by an average of 0.7 percent.

Food prices rose by 1.0 percent. Household energy prices fell by 4.5 percent, albeit from a high base. Gas prices were 9.2 percent lower and electricity prices declined by 2.9 percent, KSH reports.

Consumer durable prices edged down by 1.7 percent. Prices in the category of goods that includes vehicle fuel rose by 3.9 percent, with vehicle fuels up by 3.5 percent.

Harmonised inflation, adjusted for better comparison with other European Union member states, was 3.6 percent.

Core inflation, which excludes volatile fuel and food prices, was 4.1 percent.

The CPI calculated with a basket of goods and services used by pensioners was 3.7 percent.

Commenting on the data, Márton Nagy, the national economy minister, said inflation remained low, in line with the trend in earlier months. Inflation, which fell to one-seventh of last year's CPI, posed no challenge to the national economy, he added.

Nagy said the government had successfully protected families, companies and jobs through targeted and effective measures.

Bulgaria and Azerbaijan have a common interest in using their strategic position and advantages to build both energy, transport and digital connectivity, with which to contribute to the security and stability of the entire region and to intensify the exchange between Asia and Europe. This was stated today Head of State Rumen Radev, who is on an official visit to the Republic of Azerbaijan at the invitation of President Ilham Aliyev.

At a ceremony in the Zagulba residence, Rumen Radev and Ilham Aliyev signed a Joint Declaration on strengthening the strategic partnership between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan. According to the Bulgarian head of state, the document is an expression of the significant potential and the mutual desire for the excellent bilateral relations to develop actively for the prosperity of the two friendly countries and peoples.

In the presence of the two presidents, a Memorandum of Understanding was also signed between the state oil company of Azerbaijan SOCAR and Asarel Investment JSC, a contract for joint operation between Bulgaria Air and the Azerbaijan National Airlines on the line Sofia-Baku-Sofia, and the resumed through flights will start operating in the coming months, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Innovation and Growth of Bulgaria and the Ministry of Digital Development and Transport of Azerbaijan for cooperation in the field of technological innovation and research and development, which lay the foundation for joint projects and initiatives at government and business level.

In his statement, President Radev highlighted the intensive dialogue at the highest political level between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan, which contributes to the development of a number of initiatives not only bilaterally, but also contributes to the strengthening of Europe's energy security, as well as stability and economic development of the Caucasus and the Black Sea region.

Azerbaijan has become a key partner of Bulgaria in the field of energy and has made a significant contribution to the diversification of natural gas supplies for the Bulgarian economy, Rumen Radev noted. The head of state recalled that in the autumn of 2022, in the presence of President Aliyev, the intersystem gas connection Greece-Bulgaria (IGB) was opened in Sofia, which established the connection with the Southern Gas Corridor and practically changed the energy map of the region. President Radev also pointed to the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2023 in Sofia between the operators of the gas transmission systems of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and the state oil company of Azerbaijan SOCAR for the transfer of additional quantities of Azeri gas to Europe, based on the Bulgarian initiative Solidarity Ring. As an indicator of the long-term prospects of cooperation between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan in the field of energy, President Radev stated the joint opening with his colleague Aliyev of the SOCAR office in Sofia.

The strategic partnership at the highest level has led to the development and deepening of contacts at the government level, between companies and municipalities from both countries, the head of state also emphasised and highlighted the importance of fostering the trade-economic partnership and the development of connectivity in all its dimensions - energy, transport and digital exchange in the field of high technologies, partnership in innovation, green policies and technologies, environmental protection, tourism, education, science and culture.

Rumen Radev stressed the importance of the agreements signed today between Bulgarian and Azeri companies, which contribute to Azerbaijan's ambition to establish itself as a leading country in the region in terms of environmental protection using modern technologies, including the use of unmanned cargo drones. President Aliyev invited the Bulgarian head of state to participate in the UN climate change summit COP 29, which will be hosted by Azerbaijan.

The rich cultural and historical heritage of Bulgaria and Azerbaijan is a solid basis for the subsequent strengthening of bilateral cultural exchange, the two presidents emphasised at their meeting. In this regard, Rumen Radev noted the importance of the initiative for cooperation between the historical capitals of the two countries, Veliko Tarnovo and Shusha, which arose during the last visit of President Aliyev to Bulgaria, in the field of cultural and historical heritage. Rumen Radev expressed his appreciation for the personal contribution of President Ilham Aliyev to start the projects to not only preserve the cultural heritage of Veliko Tarnovo, but also to popularise it and facilitate access to it.

The President of Azerbaijan emphasised the active political dialogue between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan at the highest level, which, in his words, significantly contributes to the expansion of bilateral relations in all spheres of mutual interest and to the achievement of new successes. The trade exchange between the two countries and the volume of natural gas supplies from Azerbaijan to Bulgaria are increasing annually, Ilham Aliyev pointed out. He pointed to the important role of the Bulgarian side in supplying Azeri gas to the European market and strengthening the security of the energy sector in Europe. The transit of Azeri gas to neighbouring countries takes place through the territory of Bulgaria, and the number of countries that take advantage of this opportunity is increasing, the President of Azerbaijan pointed out. Ilham Aliyev also highlighted the interest of Azerbaijan in deepening the partnership with Bulgaria for the implementation of the project for the so-called green cable for the transmission of green electricity to Europe.

Rumen Radev was welcomed by the head of state of Azerbaijan with an official ceremony, the two presidents held a one-to-one session and led the plenary talks between the delegations of the two countries. The delegation led by the Bulgarian president includes the interim Minister of Energy, the chair of the Bulgaria-Azerbaijan Friendship Group in the National Assembly and business representatives, who also signed a number of bilateral agreements with their partners within the framework of a joint business meeting.

As part of his visit to Azerbaijan, President Rumen Radev also held a meeting with the Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Prof Sahiba Gafarova. Later in the day, the head of state talked with Bulgarian specialists working in the field of sports in Azerbaijan.

Widespread use of fossil fuels and, as a result, an increase in the volume of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, causes the temperature to rise in the world.

For these reasons, we can say that holding the COP29, which is the largest event in the world, is not a one-sided issue. In the issue of climate change, the international community and the countries of the world have a great responsibility.

Azerbaijan's hosting of COP29 can be considered the most important event of 2024 and a logical continuation of the country's strategy of transition to a green economy. The declaration of 2024 as the ""Year of Solidarity for the Green World"" in our country by the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan is a confirmation of the value given to this mission.

The next reality of the energy policy of Azerbaijan, which has rich alternative energy resources, is related to the development of ""green energy"". The strategic basis of renewable energy production policy is ""Azerbaijan 2030: National Priorities of Socio-Economic Development"" defined by the state and adopted in February 2021. One of the five national priorities - clean environment and ""green growth"" country priority sets new goals.

In addition, the ""Socio-economic development strategy of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2022-2026"" envisages increasing the share of renewable energy sources in electricity production to 24 percent by 2026, and to 30 percent by 2030.

When we look at the work done and the goals set, we see a country that is not satisfied with just making promises but achieves concrete results with strategic environmental decisions. This country is proving its importance to the green energy economy with practical activities. Thus, Azerbaijan aimed to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases by 35 percent by 2030, and by 40 percent by 2050, compared to 1990.

Despite its name being closely associated with oil, Azerbaijan is a leader in the implementation of approaches to the transition to green energy in the region and makes a great contribution to the fight against the consequences of climate change.

Azerbaijan takes practical measures to combat climate change and the ecological well-being of the planet. One of the main priorities in the reconstruction of the liberated territories is the restoration of the ecosystem and the protection of the environment. As the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev said, Karabakh will be a ""green energy"" zone.

In accordance with the country's socio-economic development priorities, in the current and future period, more attention is paid to the use of renewable energy sources and the expansion of the application of ""green"" technologies.

Renewable energy projects with a capacity of 7 gigawatts will be implemented in Azerbaijan by 2030, 5 gigawatts of this capacity are planned to be exported.

In this direction, Azerbaijan is currently implementing a 240 MW wind power plant project with ACWA Power, a reputable company of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the field of renewable energy.

Thus, in 2022, a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of offshore wind energy was signed between the Ministry of Energy of Azerbaijan and the ACWA Power Company of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The memorandum envisages cooperation in determining the main principles of cooperation in the field of offshore wind energy, assessing potential, and creating conditions for profitable investment in renewable energy projects in Azerbaijan.

According to the memorandum, on January 13, 2022, the groundbreaking ceremony of the ""Khizi-Absheron"" Wind Power Station was held in Azerbaijan by the ACWA Power Company.

It should be noted that ""Khizi-Absheron"" KES will be the largest power plant in the renewable energy sector in Azerbaijan with a capacity of 240 megawatts.

It was reported that the Wind Power Plant will be put into operation in 2025. By producing one billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, the station will save approximately 220 million cubic meters of natural gas and prevent more than 400,000 tons of carbon emissions from being released into the atmosphere.

Within the framework of the work carried out in this field, camera studies are ongoing across the country in the direction of identifying and prioritizing areas with the potential for renewable energy sources.

Along with the consumption and export of traditional energy resources of Azerbaijan, it attaches great importance to renewable energy due to its high potential.

It should be noted that Azerbaijan is one of the countries with high potential for renewable energy sources. According to calculations, the technical potential of renewable energy sources in our country is 135 gigawatts on land and 157 gigawatts at sea.

The economic potential of renewable energy sources is 27 gigawatts, including 3,000 megawatts of wind energy, 23,000 megawatts of solar energy, and 380 megawatts of bioenergy. The potential of mountain rivers is estimated at 520 megawatts.

Azerbaijan already has the experience of using wind energy and interest in this field is growing. Taking into account the environment, economic infrastructure, and geographical location, the wind energy potential in Azerbaijan is estimated at 800 MW.

The full use of this energy would save 20% of the energy produced now.

It should also be noted that in terms of wind energy, the Absheron Peninsula, coastal areas of the Caspian Sea, and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic are particularly favorable. At the same time, based on preliminary studies, it was determined that the technical potential of wind energy in the mountainous areas of Lachin and Kalbajar is 2000 MW.

According to preliminary estimates, this energy resource is approximately 2.4 billion. kW/s means electricity. This, in turn, costs 0.8 mln. ton means saving fuel.

In recent years, a large amount of investment has been made in the creation and restoration of energy infrastructure. In particular, the interest in alternative energy fields has increased significantly.

The start of operation of the Garadag Solar Power Station (GES) last year is the beginning of a new stage. Garadagh HPP is the first station built at the expense of foreign investment in our country. Thus, the project of the station is implemented with the prestigious ""Masdar"" company of the United Arab Emirates.

The 230 MW solar plant was officially inaugurated on October 26, 2023. Garadag Solar Power Plant is the largest solar power plant in the Caspian region and the CIS. The station was built with foreign investment worth 262 million US dollars.

It will be possible to save 110 million cubic meters of natural gas by producing 500 million kilowatt-hours of electricity at the station every year. This will reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere by 200,000 tons. The transition to green energy also shows the country's commitment to its obligations regarding carbon emissions. According to the commitment, Azerbaijan must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2050 and create a ""zero emission"" zone in the territories freed from occupation. As can be seen, serious measures are already being taken in this direction.

In the field of renewable energy in Azerbaijan, implementing the Yashma power plant construction project, turning Nakhchivan into a green energy zone along with Garabagh and East Zangazur (the possibility of building a 500 MW solar power plant is being considered), and the 240 MW power plant in Jabrayl, in which British company bp acts as a direct foreign investor. plans to launch a solar power plant.

One of the importance of the energy facility ""Shafaq"" Solar Power Station, which will be built with BP, is that it will be built in the territories freed from occupation. It is known that President Ilham Aliyev declared these territories - an area of 10,000 square kilometers - a ""green energy"" zone shortly after the victory in the 44-day Patriotic War. Therefore, the construction of ""Shafaq"" will play an important role in the realization of this goal, and will become a part of the grand construction carried out in Garabagh and Eastern Zangazur in general.

At the same time, it plans to implement SOCAR's project on connecting electric cables to offshore platforms to reduce the use of natural gas in enterprises in the country, as well as the construction of an underwater cable through the bottom of the Black Sea to transport green energy from Azerbaijan to Europe.

""SOCAR Green"" LLC is expected to implement several important projects soon. Thus, in the initial phase of the ""Mega"" project, ""SOCAR Green"" and ""Masdar"" companies are planning to implement 1 GW wind and solar energy projects on land. ""SOCAR Green"" will also implement solar and wind energy projects in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic together with ""ACWA Power"", ""Masdar"" and ""Energy China"". Let's emphasize that Nakhchivan has been declared a ""green energy"" zone due to its rich resources in the mentioned area.

At the same time, studies are being conducted on the transportation of hydrogen to the European market through the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). In particular, the requirements for the construction of the necessary equipment for the transportation of natural gas and hydrogen mixture through the TAP pipeline are being studied. At the same time, in cooperation with international companies such as bp and KBR (Great Britain), Masdar (UAE), and Equinor (Norway), discussions are held on promising technologies for the production of hydrogen.

It should be recalled that on December 17, 2022, the ""Agreement on strategic partnership in the field of development and transmission of green energy"" was signed between Azerbaijan, Georgia, Hungary, and Romania in Bucharest. This agreement envisages laying a 1,100-kilometer submarine cable under the Black Sea as the main channel providing Europe with ""green energy"". According to the agreement, 4 gigawatts of green energy will be exported to Europe at the initial stage. In other words, Azerbaijan aimed to build a ""green energy"" bridge to Europe.

Azerbaijan's green energy strategy is multifaceted and all risks have been taken into account. Azerbaijan, which is the leading country in the region in terms of energy resources, will maintain its position in the green energy sector as well. This is a well-thought-out and forward-looking energy policy. These projects are very valuable both for the protection of the environment, for the provision of economic power, and for raising the general level of development.",today.az,news,Today.Az,,0.3568627450980393,453026435,10,http://www.today.az/pictures/pic248175.jpg,

Bilateral trade has grown from 3 billion US dollars to 12 billion in twenty years, while there are seven Chinese city destinations reachable by air from Budapest, Orbán said.

He said today's joint statement spoke of a strategic partnership, adding that it was both ""an honour and a great opportunity"" for Hungary to be able to participate in the modernisation of China's economy. This was also true of China's willingness to participate in the development and modernisation of Hungary's economy, he added.

From virtually zero Chinese investments in Hungary twenty years ago, three-quarters of incoming investments came China last year, providing ""a safe and predictable livelihood to tens of thousands of people"".

Orbán said Hungary was ""proud"" to be well situated in the competition for such investments, noting that the country ""provides fair and decent conditions for Chinese companies that invest here"".

The prime minister said Hungary was a meeting point for cutting-edge Western and Eastern technologies. Hungarians, he said, had ""serious ambitions"". Hungary, he added, had lost the previous ""shameful century"", but it wanted to win the 21st century. ""For this we need partners, investors and the world's most modern technologies,"" he said.

Cooperation between Hungary and China across the spectrum of the nuclear industry holds great potential, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán after bilateral talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Budapest on Thursday.

In a joint press statement with Xi, the Hungarian prime minister said this intent was as much an expression of trust as ""an economic fact"".

Referring to Hungary's ""significant international experience and prestige"" in the nuclear industry, Orbán said: ""For over fifty years we've been in this industry, and Europe's biggest nuclear development is underway in Hungary."" By the start of the next decade the proportion of nuclear energy in Hungary's energy mix is planned to be 60-70 percent, he added.

Orbán thanked Xi for agreeing to new Hungarian agricultural and food exports to China.

Hungary supports China's peace initiative aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said in a joint press statement with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Budapest on Thursday.

Orban said that Europe today was ""on the side of war"" with the sole exception of Hungary.

He noted that Hungary has called for an immediate ceasefire and peace negotiations, and backs ""all international efforts aimed at peace"".

The prime minister said no solution to the war could be found on the battlefield. ""We need a ceasefire and peace negotiations,"" he reiterated.

China and Hungary ""have always been friends"", but now the two countries' ties are the best they have ever been, President Xi Jinping said in Budapest on Thursday in a joint press statement with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

During his meeting with Orbán, he said they agreed on the enduring mutual trust and friendship that characterised relations between the two countries as well as their desire to establish mutually beneficial cooperation.

Bilateral ties ""must be further developed"", Xi said, noting that they had formulated a statement on a ""comprehensive strategic partnership"".

""Mutual political trust has created the bedrock for strengthening Chinese-Hungarian relations,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Xi said China highly valued Hungary's ""firm commitment to the One China policy"", and he pledged to provide China's steady support for Hungary's economic development.

He added that both countries planned to deepen their economic, commercial and financial cooperation in the future.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's visiting Hungary is of historic importance and the summit has yielded results matching the occasion, the minister of foreign affairs and trade said on Thursday, adding that representatives of the two countries had signed 18 important agreements.

Péter Szijjártó called Xi's visit ""historic' as it was the first time for a Chinese president to visit Hungary in the past twenty years. He also noted that Hungary and China were celebrating the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties.

Szijjártó said talks between the Chinese President and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had been ""extremely successful"". He said the two sides expanded an earlier a list of joint projects under the Belt and Road initiative aimed at developing East-West connections, and would start preparations of a Hungarian-Chinese project to build a railway ring around Budapest. The ring, he said, was needed to make transport between large Chinese investments in the eastern parts of Hungary and western markets more efficient and sustainable.

""Similarly, we will start preparations for an express rail link aimed at providing fast and civilised access from central Budapest to the airport,"" he said. He also noted that seven large cities in China were now accessible from Budapest by way of a daily 19 direct flights.

Preparations for the development of a nationwide network of charging points for electric cars will also get under way, the minister said.

Szijjártó said Hungary and Serbia was embarking on building Europe's most modern, biggest, safest and fastest border crossing.

""The road crossing at Roszke is extremely busy. We're all too familiar with the images of long lines of lorries and cars. We don't want this to be the case in the future..."" he said.

The minister announced that Serbian and Chinese partners would examine how to build a crude pipeline in the shortest possible time between Hungary and Serbia, with the goal of beefing up the security of energy supplies for the two countries and the whole region.

Meanwhile, he said farm exports were important to bilateral trade, noting that Hungary has the most Chinese export licences in central Europe. Thanks to today's agreement, more produce has been added to the list, he said, citing the example of cherries.

Also, cooperation will be extended to nuclear energy, he said. ""We have now agreed with the Chinese government on drafting a cooperation agreement covering the length and breadth of the nuclear industry to ensure both countries' access to the cheapest, safest, most efficient way of producing electricity,"" Szijjártó said.

Demand for electricity will increase sharply the world over, he said, adding that nuclear energy best met such demand.",dailynewshungary.com,news,Daily News Hungary,,0.3254901960784313,453022659,75,https://contentf5.dailynewshungary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/chinese-investment-szijjarto.jpg,eng-9555433

Ukraine this week said it uncovered a network of Russian agents in the country who planned to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky, including two colonels who worked for the agency in charge of his security.

The Ukrainian domestic intelligence service (SBU) on Tuesday said the two were tasked by Moscow with finding people in Zelensky's security detail who would take the president hostage and later kill him.

The agency they worked for, known as the State Protection Service, oversees security for Ukraine's president as well as ministers and other top officials.

One of the colonels, the SBU said, had purchased weapons and drones for the operation and was recorded in conversation with his handlers at the FSB, the Russian spy agency.

The alleged conspiracy was the latest in a series of foiled Russian plots that Ukrainian authorities said were intended to kill or capture the president, since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It comes just weeks after Ukrainian and Polish authorities announced the arrest a Polish citizen accused of helping Russia's military intelligence carry out such an assassination plot.

Russia carried out a ""massive"" missile attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure overnight into Wednesday in the biggest aerial onslaught by Russian forces for weeks.

Russia used 76 air attack weapons in the assault, including 55 missiles and 21 drones launched from Russia and Russian controlled areas, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. At least 59 weapons were destroyed overnight, he added.

The attacks targeted power generation and transmission facilities in Ukraine's Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Vinnytsia regions, the country's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko posted on Telegram.

""The enemy wants to deprive us of the ability to generate and transmit electricity in sufficient quantities. Saving electricity is a contribution of each of us to the victory,"" Halushchenko said.

The EU this week reached a deal to seize profits from Russia's frozen assets to fund weapons and aid for Ukraine within months.

EU senior diplomats meeting on Wednesday agreed a compromise on using the estimated 4.4 billion euros windfall profits to aid Ukraine, smoothing over a dispute about taxation and management costs in Belgium, the country where most of the frozen assets are held.

Euroclear, a clearing house in Brussels, holds 191 billion euros of the 260 billion euros of Russian Central Bank assets that were immobilised by western governments in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In February the clearing house reported 4.4 billion euros interest on the Russian funds and forecast that the Belgian government would reap 1.085 billion euros in taxes.

The final amount for Ukraine has yet to be confirmed, but should be available in July.

The EU -- wary of the legal ramifications of seizing the entire cache of Russian assets -- decided it could give the profits to Ukraine, after concluding Moscow had no legal right to these funds.

North Macedonia elected its first woman president Wednesday as the governing Social Democrats suffered historic losses in twin presidential and parliamentary elections. Conservative-backed Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, a 70-year-old law professor, was declared the winner after receiving nearly 65 per cent support in a presidential runoff. In parliamentary elections, a coalition led by conservative VMRO-DPMNE won 43 per cent of the vote, while the Social Democrat-led coalition that has held power for the least seven years struggled to hold onto second place with 14.8 per cent.

Croatia's ruling conservatives on Wednesday meanwhile agreed to form a coalition with an extreme party, which would push the country further to the right ahead of next month's European parliamentary election. The governing Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, and the far-right Homeland Movement reached the agreement weeks after an inconclusive parliamentary vote that has stirred political uncertainty. Croatia's dominant HDZ won most votes at the election but not enough to stay in power on their own.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was in Budapest on Thursday, where he and Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán discussed trade, investment and signed a series of cooperation deals. Hungary is currently the only EU country participating in China's Belt and Road infrastructure and investment initiative. Before arriving in Hungary, Xi visited Serbia where he and Serb President Aleksandar Vučić agreed to follow a ""shared future"". Serbia will also become the first European country in years to enter into a free trade agreement with China when a deal signed last year comes into effect on July 1.

The European Union is poised to close the chapter on its long-running dispute with Poland over democratic backsliding under the previous nationalist government. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday the so-called Article 7 procedure, which was launched in 2017 and threatened to strip Warsaw of its voting rights, can be closed. Earlier this year, the commission decided to free up as much as 137 billion euros in blocked aid to Poland after Donald Tusk's government presented a plan to restore judicial independence, the main point of contention with the EU.

Tensions around Georgia's controversial draft ""foreign agents"" law could hit the country's economy and investor confidence, the president of the EBRD Odile Renaud-Basso warned on Tuesday. The draft legislation would require organisations receiving more than 20 per cent of their funding from abroad to register as foreign agents, a requirement opponents attack as authoritarian and Kremlin-inspired. The draft legislation has sparked protests across Georgia while Brussels and Washington have urged Tbilisi to drop it or risk harming its chances of European Union membership and a broader Euro-Atlantic future.

Armenia said on Wednesday that it has stopped making financial contributions to the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) after effectively suspending its membership in the Russian-led military alliance. ""Armenia will refrain from signing up to the November 23, 2023, decision on the CSTO budget for 2024 and, thereby, from participating in the financing of the organisation's activities,"" Armenian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ani Badalian told several media outlets, including Armenia's Public Television.

Police in Slovakia are trying to find out who sent more than 1,000 bomb threats to schools and other institutions on Tuesday. Police teams with sniffer dogs and bomb disposal experts were called out repeatedly across the country. The alerts prompted mass evacuations. Officials said they were treating the threats ""as a particularly serious crime of terrorist attack"". Emails from an anonymous sender reportedly began arriving at 05:00, alleging that explosives were stored in hundreds of schools spanning the country's eight regions.

Romania-based Early Game Ventures (EGV), a venture capital firm, on Thursday announced the launch of a new 60 millions euros fund -- Early Game Ventures Fund II, to invest in early-stage start-ups in CEE. The fund received 30 million euros from the European Investment Fund's Recovery Equity Fund, financed by the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience under the Next Generation EU. The new fund will invest in early-stage technology start-ups with a focus on areas such as cyber security, enterprise software, and AI applications.

Prepared for the challenges of the future, the Group plans on spending EUR 1 bln in the near future to develop its electricity network in Hungary.

The company is continuously in search of innovative tools to support the use of renewable energy to ensure grid stability and resilience.

Moreover, E. ON has produced a video series based on the survey's results and lessons learned from the research. In the third and final episode of the show, Gergely Papp. a Hungarian media personality often known by his nickname ""Mr. Cheeky"", explores how the electricity grid of the future will be built.

A recent national survey from E.ON clearly shows that respondents want to see a significant increase in the share of green energy, especially solar and wind, in the future. 92% of respondents emphasized the importance of increasing the role of renewables, with 76% of them calling for more solar power and 65% for more wind.

Survey participants were adamant about the need to improve the electricity grid: increasingly more electricity is needed, utilization of renewables has increased rapidly, and the systems for production and consumption have changed. Whereas in the past electricity was delivered to homes from large, centralized power plants, now numerous customers not only consume but also generate electricity via solar panels. In the past, electricity's journey ended in the home, but now, thanks to solar PV systems, it is being distributed to other users via the electricity grid.

Moreover, the sunlight conditions at different times of the day must also be tracked. Solar panels generate power during daylight hours, which increases the overall amount of energy coming from that source. However, that power is typically consumed later and in other geographical locations. Therefore, in order to be able to take in as much renewable electricity as possible, networks capable of delivering it must be developed. Towards that end, in Hungary E.ON plans to invest EUR 390 million of its own resources this year, and EUR 1 bln on grid development in the near future, which would be considered a substantial investment anywhere in Europe.

Innovation for the Future Network

Looking into the not-too-distant future, the survey shows that most respondents (84%) believe that by 2030 the grid of the future will likely offer more in terms of energy storage. They continue to see a significant role for small-scale household-scale power plants (88%) and even more (89%) think that energy storage will be adjacent to domestic solar panels, e.g. in households. Meanwhile, digitalisation (91%) is expected to be the most certain path for such development, say survey respondents.

E.ON is currently deploying numerous smart solutions and testing many innovations on its electricity network, all of which are meant to address forthcoming challenges. Its energy storage systems help to provide temporary storage for solar generation, which has seen a rapid increase in deployment in recent years, for example, addressing an increase in demand in the evening, when that stored energy is needed. The advent of solar panels has also made it necessary to address voltage problems. A new device, the mobile voltage regulator, is able to manage voltage problems faster and more cost-effectively than traditional grid installations and can be tailored to the needs of the site. Smart metering sensors installed last year render the operation of a low-voltage network operation and make possible faults visible to the operator, so troubleshooting can begin before a customer calls in a service irregularity.

Via the spread of smart meters into homes, consumers will clearly see the complete transformation of the energy industry that is currently underway. E.ON has steadily increased the proportion of smart meters in its service area in recent years, with 432,000 of them currently in use and more to follow. They have proven indispensable for households with solar panels, enabling them to monitor not only electricity consumption but also the amount of electricity being fed into the grid. Replacing traditional meters, smart meter readings are done remotely, opening up new possibilities for fault detection and repair.

A Glimpse of How the Power Grid of the Future Will Work

E. ON recently launched a video public awareness campaign with television personality Gergely Papp. In these special reports, viewers learn how electricity works, and then Gergely joins E.ON's troubleshooting team to show us what happens behind the scenes, from the first fault signal to turning the power back on. In the third and final episode of the video series, Papp looks at the challenges that the utility faces in the face of increased energy demand and the spread of solar power generation. The series also shows how innovative solutions are helping consumers to enjoy the services of the grid of the future, even today.",bbj.hu,news,Budapest Business Journal,,0.3803921568627451,452963586,41,https://bbj.hu/uploads/banners/20245/Napelemek az út mentén.png,eng-9549628

The parties agreed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, the Ministry for National Economy announced.

Márton Nagy, Minister for National Economy, said at the meeting held at the Ministry that a new industrial revolution is taking place in the world today, which is clearly about the green transition and is also renewing mobility. The energy development taking place globally and in Hungary is proceeding at a rapid pace, he stressed. Moreover, he pointed out, in transport, it is no longer just a question of a green future, but rather of a ""green present.""

The Minister believes that Hungary has taken steps in this area at the right time.

Today's strategic consultation is another step in this process, he noted.

The Minister added that Hungary seeks cooperation and partnership based on mutual respect with everyone, and this is no different in the case of China and Chinese enterprises. Hungary's aim is to further strengthen its role as an economic meeting point, i.e. to bring together Eastern and Western capital and high-tech in Hungary.

The energy component of the Trans-Caspian and Middle Corridors are expanding, not only through oil and gas but also through green energy. In early May, a very important document was signed in Tashkent: a memorandum of cooperation in the field of integrating the power systems of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The three countries have joined forces to produce green energy and exporting it to Europe.

The memorandum implies that the parties intend to explore the possibilities of connecting their power systems by laying a high-voltage cable along the bottom of the Caspian Sea and through the territories of other countries to enable optimal technical and economic trade of green energy produced in Azerbaijan Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.

A project technical specification for laying a deep-sea cable along the Caspian seabed has already been developed. Within the framework of this specification, a proposed business model for the development of international transmission corridors (financing, revenue stream, and ownership) will be created for selling green energy to EU member states. This project forms the basis of the memorandum of cooperation on the inter-system connection of the energy systems of the three countries.

Underwater Cable

The idea of laying an underwater power cable became possible after the adoption of the Caspian Sea Convention in 2018. This so-called ""Caspian Constitution"" stipulates that ""the routing of underwater cables and pipelines must be coordinated with the party through whose seabed sector the cable or pipeline is to be laid."" In November 2019, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan announced the start of laying the TransCaspian Fibre Optic (TCFO) line across the bottom of the Caspian Sea. According to forecasts from the Kazakh side, this cable will connect China and the EU via the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan.

Now, it is time for the deep-sea electric cable. Last year, negotiations took place between Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan and after a meeting of the Southern Gas Corridor Advisory Council in Baku in February of last year, a new direction was introduced: exporting green energy by Azerbaijan and its partners to Europe. The Tashkent memorandum is a natural consequence of these developments, as is the agreement reached in November 2023 by Baku, Tashkent and Astana to create a joint venture to export green energy to Europe.

The resources derived from the inter-system connection of the energy systems of the three countries will travel a considerable distance to Europe and significantly alter the energy balance in the region.

Earlier an agreement on the implementation of the Black Sea Energy project between Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania and Hungary was signed in December 2022 in Bucharest. It involves laying a 1-GW underwater cable stretching 1,195 km - 95 km of the cable will be overland and 1,100 km underwater.

This cable will be designated for transporting green electricity produced in Azerbaijan through Georgia and the Black Sea to Romania for further transmission to Hungary and the rest of Europe. Initially, the plans were agreed between the EU and Georgia, with Azerbaijan joining later, expanding the project to potentially include the export of electricity from Central Asian countries as well.

Azerbaijan

According to official data, in 2023 Azerbaijan increased its electricity production by 0.9% and its exports by 8.3% year on year. The country's electricity production rose to 29.3bn kWh. In 2023, thermal power plants (TPPs) generated 27.2bn kWh of electricity, hydroelectric power stations produced 1.8bn kWh, and other energy sources contributed 359mn kWh.

Wind power plants generated 56.6mn kWh of electricity, solar power plants 79.4mn kWh, and solid waste processing facilities 223mn kWh. Meanwhile, energy imports increased by 54.5%, significantly outpacing the growth in export figures. However, considering the projects currently underway and those planned to start in the coming years, Azerbaijan's capabilities are expected to increase significantly due to the expanded use of renewable energy sources.

The production of green energy is expected to rise to about 3,000-4,000 MW in the next 3-4 years. The country has significant potential in renewable energy, particularly with a confirmed potential of 157,000 MW on the Caspian.

It should be noted that Azerbaijan has already signed contracts and memoranda with leading global companies in renewable energy, aiming to produce 10,000 MW of electricity from renewable sources. Experts believe that even if only a third or half of this volume becomes a reality, it will be a major energy source for Europe.

Partners

The issue of transforming Kazakhstan into an electricity exporter has raised some questions domestically, due to Kazakhstan's own electricity shortage. However, the country's Ministry of Energy has alleviated concerns by stating that, despite the current electricity deficit in Kazakhstan, there is significant potential for renewable energy development, including wind and solar power, in the western regions. In the future, with the development of generation capacities, the balance of the Western region could have the potential to export electricity to European countries.

The national electric grid of the Republic of Kazakhstan serves as the system-forming network within the Unified Energy System, which also facilitates electrical connections between the republic's regions and the energy systems of neighbouring countries (the Russian Federation, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Uzbekistan). To ensure reliable energy supply for the country's economy and population, a phased introduction of new energy capacities and the modernisation of existing power stations are planned in the coming years. To facilitate the systematic and sustainable development of the energy sector, an Energy Balance up to 2035 has been approved, which anticipates nearly doubling the new capacities.

Uzbekistan also plans to double its electricity production by 2030 to ensure the country's energy security and to connect to the export of electricity to Europe. By 2025, the capacity of the country's energy system is expected to reach 25.6 GW, with thermal power plants providing 18.8 GW, hydroelectric power stations 2.5 GW, and solar and wind energy 4.3 GW. Uzbekistan has already gone since overtaken Kazakhstan to become Central Asia's renewable energy leader. By 2030, the total production capacity will reach 29,200 MW, effectively doubling from today's level.

Why does the EU need electricity from Central Asia?

Azerbaijan and Central Asian countries possess significant solar and wind energy potential, thanks to their relatively low population density, large territories, and many sunny days per year, making them unique platforms for the development of green energy. Collaborative participation in projects related to alternative energy sources will allow each country to efficiently use its potential in this economic sector. However, there are challenges, such as the high costs of modernising existing electricity generation infrastructure in Central Asia - costs so substantial that international development banks are reluctant to fund entire projects, opting instead for targeted investments in specific components. Integrating the energy systems of these three countries may help solve this problem to some extent.

As the Black Sea Power Line project progresses, there may be growing interest in investing in the Caspian submarine cable and the energy infrastructure of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Europe is highly interested in diversifying its energy supplies and in importing electricity, even from such great distances. The problem is that EU countries, having set the ambitious goal of phasing out fossil fuels within ten years, do not have the capacity to achieve this goal on their own. Typically, European countries are small in area and have high population densities, while solar and wind power plants require large spaces. Compensating for the lack of space for large solar power plants with innovations would be even more costly, hence the EU is forced to import.

Unlike crowded Europe, Central Asia and Azerbaijan have all the conditions necessary for the development of green energy. Additionally, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan can play a significant role in the mining of critical raw materials used in the production of solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. These include lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, silver and others. For instance, demand for lithium is growing globally, with its price having increased by more than 400% in recent years. Central Asia contains large deposits of many types of critical raw materials. For example, Kazakhstan currently produces 19 of the 34 types of raw materials listed as ""critical"" by the EU.

In summary, the region is attractive both for its renewable energy potential and for its capabilities in raw material extraction and equipment production for green energy generation. It seems likely that Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan will fully capitalise on these advantages.",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,0.3411764705882352,452928179,51,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneGeneric_begreen_solar_renewables_electricity_pylons_power.jpeg,

It is disturbing that the stipends of Nigerians studying abroad on scholarship have not been paid in the past 11 months by the federal government. ""Some students in China have not received any stipends since they arrived in April and May 2023. In Russia, students are struggling with the increased cost of living due to sanctions,"" according to their statement referenced by a national newspaper during the week. These are students studying under the federal government's bilateral educational agreement scholarship with partnering countries, a scheme supervised by the Federal Ministry of Education. ""This pattern of delayed payments has persisted for years, diverting our focus from academic pursuits to survival (contemplating our next meal, daily transport, pending payments, medical expenses, and housing.)""

Over the years, unpaid allowances have become a pervasive issue plaguing Nigerian scholars abroad, and impacting badly on their pursuit of academic excellence. These scholars, entrusted with representing their country on the global stage, face numerous challenges when essential allowances, such as tuition and living stipends, remain unpaid. As of today, Nigerian students studying in Morocco, Algeria, China, Russia, Hungary, and other countries, on a federal government scholarship scheme are owed their basic allowances as the culture of delayed payment seems to have taken root.

This delay has also led to dire consequences, especially for those residing in countries like Morocco, where the country doesn't have adequate provisions for school hostels, unlike the other sister BEA countries. This means that stipends are crucial for covering basic expenses such as housing, electricity bills, handouts, internet bills, water bills, transportation, and food. Many of these students are now going through harrowing times for no fault of theirs.

This systemic issue not only undermines the potential of Nigerian scholars but also tarnishes the reputation of Nigerian academia on the international platform. Without financial stability, scholars grapple with stress, distraction, and even potential expulsion due to unpaid fees, hindering their focus on studies and research. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding their financial situation erodes their motivation, leading to a decline in academic performance and diminishing the quality of their research output.

For the Nigerian scholars in Russia, the situation is worse given the level of hardship facing the people as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine. There were reports that some of the students had to settle for menial jobs to survive. According to the spokesperson for the parents' group, Kola Benson, since last June, when the students received their last payment, they have not been paid with most of the parents having to beg relatives to send financial support to their wards.

Curiously, a government that seems to have imbibed a culture of delay in the payment of the allowances for the existing scholars has not deemed it fit to suspend the enrolment of new scholars as it selected a new set numbering 179 to study in various institutions in Russia under the Bilateral Education Agreement (BEA) last November. President Bola Tinubu should wade into this crisis and save the innocent children from avoidable embarrassments in foreign lands. All obstacles to prompt payment of these allowances should be tackled immediately.

To renew the hope of Nigerian scholars, the government should implement transparent budget allocation by ensuring sufficient funds are allocated in the federal budget specifically designated for the payment of Nigerian scholars abroad. The government should also establish an effective monitoring mechanism to track the disbursement of allowances from the federal government to relevant agencies. Again, there is a need to streamline administrative processes involved in disbursing allowances to scholars abroad and improve communication channels between the government, relevant agencies, and scholars abroad.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,-0.03529411764705881,452907532,1,https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Screenshot_8-5-2024_214650_.jpeg,eng-9551596

You may opt out at any time.

Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Hungary on Wednesday for the third and final stop of his European tour. He began his trip on Monday in France and took a pit stop in Serbia before heading to Budapest, where he will remain until Friday.

This is the first time that the Chinese leader has visited Eastern Europe since a trip to the Czech Republic in 2016, and it demonstrates Xi's resolve to create the 16+1 group, a Chinese diplomatic initiative with former communist European countries that are investing in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Both Serbia and Hungary are BRI members.

""There are thousands of things that we can and should learn from our Chinese friends,"" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said, calling bilateral ties an ""ironclad friendship."" Beijing is Belgrade's largest foreign investor. Serbia's Infrastructure and Energy Ministry reported this year that Chinese funding reached nearly $20 billion, and on Wednesday, the two nations announced a new free trade agreement. The deal, which will begin in July, aims to cancel tariffs on almost 95 percent of Serbia's exports to China within the next five to 10 years.

Hungary also touts strong economic ties with China. Budapest received $11.5 billion in Chinese funds in 2023 alone, much of it related to electric vehicles. Whereas the European Union has warned against China dominating the critical sector, Hungary has leaned into Chinese support. Last December, Chinese carmaker BYD announced that it would build an assembly plant in Hungary, marking its first EV production facility in Europe. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hopes to announce more investment opportunities with Great Wall Motor, another Chinese-owned EV company, during Xi's visit this week.

Neither Serbia nor Hungary plan to mention human rights abuses in China, nor Beijing's support for Russia. The two European nations are both led by authoritarian-leaning politicians whose views largely align with China's anti-Western mindset. Hungary must maintain its ""policy of openness"" at a time when ""our most natural sales market [Western Europe] is sick,"" in Orban's words. Hungary and Serbia have repeatedly been critical of Western support for Ukraine in its war against Russia; Belgrade has balked at imposing sanctions on Moscow; and Budapest has vetoed EU sanctions against China on Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan issues.

Territorial claims also align Beijing with some of Eastern Europe. Just as China does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty, Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence. In turn, China supports Serbia's claims over the former territory, and Vucic has said that ""Taiwan is China -- full stop.""

Aid concerns. Israel reopened the vital Kerem Shalom crossing into southern Gaza on Wednesday. However, the United Nations said no humanitarian aid has entered thus far, a situation that a U.S. State Department spokesperson called ""just unacceptable."" Even if supplies were ready to cross, the U.N. warned that there was no one on the Gaza side to receive the aid since Palestinian workers have fled the area to escape fighting.

Israel closed Kerem Shalom over the weekend following a Hamas attack that killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. On Tuesday, Israel also took control of the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing -- prompting concern that critical aid would not be able to enter the enclave with both transit points closed. The State Department said the Rafah crossing did not open for fuel deliveries on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, fighting raged along the outskirts of Rafah on Wednesday as Israel moved ahead with its controversial ground offensive in the southern Gaza city. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed on Wednesday that Washington has paused a weapons shipment to Israel over its Rafah operation. And cease-fire negotiations remain at an impasse as talks continue in Cairo, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. CIA Director William Burns on Wednesday to discuss the potential release of hostages being held in Gaza.

EU accession on the line. North Macedonia held presidential and parliamentary elections on Wednesday, with the right-wing opposition coalition expected to win on both fronts. More than 1,700 candidates are competing for the unicameral parliament's 120 seats, while the presidential vote will decide the runoff winner of a race that began in April.

These elections could determine North Macedonia's bid to join the EU. Bulgaria remains one of the nation's biggest obstacles toward accession after blocking membership talks until North Macedonia acknowledges the country's Bulgarian minority in its constitution. Whereas the ruling Social Democratic Union has signaled its openness to the amendment, the opposition VMRO-DPMNE rejects the proposal.

Wednesday's elections ""will serve as a stark reflection of the mood within the country -- where voters are frustrated with the way European integration has progressed and eager for a much-needed overhaul of the country's many broken institutions,"" journalist Bojan Stojkovski wrote in Foreign Policy.

Massive attack. Russian forces targeted nearly a dozen energy infrastructure facilities across Ukraine on Wednesday. More than 70 missiles and drones caused serious damage at three power plants and sparked electricity cutoffs in nine regions. At least three people were injured in the Kyiv and Kirovohrad oblasts. Wednesday's attack coincided with the day that Ukraine recognizes the defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II, and it comes one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin was sworn into his record-breaking fifth term.

Moscow has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's power infrastructure to hurt public morale and damage plants that assist in military production. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Moscow has damaged nearly half of Kyiv's energy facilities, with destruction costing around $12.5 billion.

War in Ukraine and war in Palestine. Despite being a football player and lifeguard, Biden received five draft deferments for asthma, which enabled him to escape the Vietnam war which killed 60,000 young men of his generation.

Donald Trump, his presumed rival in the November presidential race played squash and tennis, received medical deferments for alleged bone spurs.

Biden was first elected by the small state of Delaware to the US Senate in 1972, becoming the youngest senator, and was reelected every six years until 2008 when he was Barack Obama's choice for vice president. During his time in the Senate, Biden took illiberal stands on a number of issues backed by his Democrat Party. He voted against authorising the 1991 Gulf War but not because he was against the war as such but on the grounds that the US was bearing most of the burden of conducting this campaign. He supported the 2001 war in Afghanistan and the 2003 unprovoked US war on Iraq. Once the Iraq war was recognised as a disaster, he expressed regret that he had backed that war. Biden unsuccessfully ran for president in 1988 and 2008 and won in 2020. At 78, he was the oldest candidate to become president. A president who had a longstanding reputation for making political mistakes on key domestic and foreign issues and committing gaffes.

Along with Britain's ex-prime minister Boris Johnson and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, Biden was a prime motivator of the war in Ukraine. Instead of promoting a peaceful settlement between Ukraine and Russia over Kyiv's bid to join NATO, they urged Ukraine's neophyte President Volodymyr Zelensky to defy Russia's President Vladimir Putin. For Putin, this was an existential challenge which could not be ignored.

Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1989-1991, US Secretary of State James Baker promised Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev that if Moscow accepted Germany's reunification, NATO would not move ""one inch eastwards"" into countries which had belonged to the Soviet bloc. While there were no written guarantees of this pledge, reassurances were given by the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Britain's Prime Minister John Major. However, NATO has added 14 new members since 1991, prompting successive Russian presidents and senior figures to accuse NATO and the West of deceit.

In his 2007 address to the Munich Security Conference, Vladimir Putin Charged the west with breaking binding assurances. While NATO membership for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other countries which had been in the Warsaw Pact was uncomfortable for Moscow, NATO expansion into Ukraine amounted to a casus bello. According to Jonathan Masters writing on the US Council on Foreign Relations website in February 2023, ""Russia has deep cultural, economic and political bonds with Ukraine, and in many ways, Ukraine is central to Russia's identity and vision for itself in the world.""

The two countries were connected by close family ties, history, language, trade, agriculture and the presence in Ukraine of a million ethnic Russians. For many Russians of the older generation like Putin, Ukraine's NATO membership would alienate Russia from itself.

On the strategic territorial front, Moscow and Kyiv both claimed ownership of Russia's Crimea which Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gifted to Ukraine in 1954 to boost ties between the two peoples. However, the majority Russian residents of Crimea longed for a return to Russia while Sevastopol is Russia's main warm water port and home to the Black Sea naval fleet.

Despite US and European funds and arms, Ukraine is not winning the war. The US injection of $62 billion cannot make up for Ukraine's shortage of trained military recruits and their will to fight. The Russian front lines remain largely impenetrable and Russia has taken rather than ceded territory. Russia can simply overcome Ukrainian efforts to regain territory and wait until Kyiv is ready to talk peace on Moscow's terms. The attempt to use Ukraine as a proxy to take on Russia has failed. Ukraine and Ukrainians are paying the price.

When meeting with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet at a Tel Aviv hotel after Hamas' October 7th surprise attack on Israel, Catholic Christian Biden declared, he is a Zionist. ""I don't believe you have to be a Jew to be a Zionist."" As a child, Biden's connection with Israel was forged by his father who believed Israel's creation to be just. Soon after entering the Senate in 1973, Biden met Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir who told him Israel's strength was determined by the fact that ""we have no place else to go"". Reuters cited Open Secrets Database which said that during his three decades in the Senate, Biden received $4.2 million in campaign funding from, pro-Israeli groups. While vice president, Biden mediated between Netanyahu and Obama. As president, Biden has given Netanyahu total support during his war on Gaza.

Without using US leverage to impose conditions, Biden has supplied tens of billions of dollars worth of 900 and 250 kilogramme bombs as well as artillery shells and other munitions Israel has used to kill nearly 35,000 Palestinians, wound 78,000, devastate Gaza and create a humanitarian catastrophe there. By giving Netanyahu everything he wants, Biden has sacrificed whatever influence he might use to press Israel to accept a ceasefire and prevent Israel from mounting an offensive in Rafah where 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering in terrible conditions without food, water, electricity and sufficient medical services.

Israel's failure in seven months to eliminate Hamas has deprived Netanyahu and his sidekick Biden of the ""total victory"" they expected, alienated the Global South and some European Countries, outraged humanitarian agencies and the UN, and prompted university students in the US and across the globe to mount anti-War, anti-Israel protests. Israel and its supporters have also lost whatever moral standing they enjoyed on the world level, the International Criminal Court could issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his generals and the International Court of Justice could brand Israel's war on Gaza as ""genocide"". Nevertheless, Biden stands by Israel and could lose November's presidential election and thereafter be cited alongside Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity.",jordantimes.com,news,Jordan Times,,-0.2470588235294118,452901864,1,,eng-9542326

Xi, who is on a six-day trip to France, Serbia and Hungary through Friday, said China regards Europe as an important dimension in its major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics and an important partner on its path toward Chinese modernisation.

Partners for cooperation

China-EU cooperation is ""complementary and mutually beneficial"" in essence, Xi said during a trilateral meeting in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

At the meeting held at Elysee Palace, Xi said that China-EU relations enjoy strong endogenous driving force and bright prospects of development, and this relationship does not target any third party, nor should it be dependent on or dictated by any third party.

The two sides have extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation in green and digital transition, Xi said, noting it is ""necessary"" for them to properly address economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultation, and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns.

""The EU is a pillar of the global economy and its members are some of China's largest trading partners,"" said Keith Bennett, an international relations consultant in London.

""Therefore, whether from the standpoint of bilateral economic and political relations, world peace and security, or major-country diplomacy, China-Europe relations are a key part of the global order,"" said Bennett.

Despite skepticism from some quarters in Europe about the benefits of trade and economic cooperation with China, empirical evidence highlights the fruitful results of China-EU economic and trade cooperation in the past decades.

Official data show that the EU stands as China's second-largest trading partner, ranking high in both imports and exports. Likewise, China is the EU's second-largest trading partner, primary source of imports, and third-largest export destination.

Meanwhile, Chinese and European enterprises continue to be upbeat about each other's markets, as statistics showed that the stock of two-way investment has exceeded 250 billion U.S. dollars.

""I believe that the economic cooperation between Europe and China is something very important. China is strong, and that is why Europe has to develop itself and be strong also,"" Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of the LVMH group, told Xinhua on Monday before the closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

When addressing the entrepreneurs at the closing ceremony, Xi urged the EU to join China to ""oppose attempts to turn business relations into political, ideological or security issues.""

""We should turn China and Europe into each other's key partners for business cooperation, priority partners for cooperation in science and technology, and trustworthy partners for cooperation in industrial and supply chains,"" Xi said.

No such thing as ""China's overcapacity

Xi's remarks came as Washington is maneuvering to rally its allies in the West to ""de-risk"" from China, and slow down the country's high-tech progress, alongside escalating protectionist rhetoric concerning the so-called ""Chinese overcapacity"" in clean energy sectors.

In the trilateral meeting with French and EU leaders, Xi rejected the claim of ""China's overcapacity"" from the perspective of comparative advantage and in light of global demand.

""China's new energy industry has made real progress in open competition and represents advanced production capacity. It not only increases global supply and alleviates the pressure of global inflation, but also contributes significantly to global climate response and green transition,"" Xi said.

Amid complaints from some Western politicians about China's electric vehicles disrupting ""global prices,"" even prominent U.S. media outlets like Bloomberg have noted that the primary concern for advanced economies revolves around the efficiency and competitiveness of Chinese electric carmakers. This encompasses factors such as their technological expertise and modern transportation infrastructure.

As to the ""overcapacity problem,"" studies have shown that the clean energy sector faces significant challenges in meeting global demand.

At the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.

In 2023, a year with a record-high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.

""On clean energy, China is a partner for us,"" Luc Remont, chairman and CEO of the French national electricity company EDF, told Xinhua before Monday's closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

""The Chinese clean energy industry is welcomed in Europe to expand its capacities within Europe as well to serve the European market. Simultaneously, European industries are actively investing in China to bolster capacities within the country,"" Remont said.

Global challenges

Xi's trip is his first visit to Europe in nearly five years, and coincides with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France.

The two sides should stay committed to the spirit that guided the establishment of their diplomatic ties, namely, independence, mutual understanding, long-term vision and mutual benefit, and enrich it with new features of the new era, Xi said during talks with Macron at Elysee Palace.

Noting that history has proven time and again that at the end of the day, conflicts can only be resolved through negotiation, Xi said when he jointly met the press with Macron that China calls on all parties to resume engagement and dialogue to build mutual trust.

As the world goes through transformation and turbulence not seen in a century, China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a ""new Cold War"" or bloc confrontation, he said.

Xi pointed out that today's world is far from being tranquil. ""China and France, as permanent members of the UN Security Council, should speak out for peaceful settlement of hotspot issues and contribute to a world of lasting peace and common security. China will work with France to advocate, on the occasion of the Paris Olympic Games, a cessation of hostilities around the world during the Games,"" he said.

""The fact that France and China, who are both permanent members of the Security Council, can work together is very important, given the reality that the world is facing two conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza,"" said Pascal Boniface, founding director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

China and France have also long collaborated on combating climate change and environmental degradation, said Boniface, adding that he is glad to witness both sides' efforts to promote a more peaceful world and strengthen multilateralism, which is currently facing significant challenges.

The Chinese president said in a written speech upon arrival that he hopes China and France will light up their way forward with the torch of history, open a brighter future of China-France relations and make new contributions to world peace, stability and development.

""I hope this visit will help cement our long-standing friendship, enhance political trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields,"" he said, adding that it is a great pleasure to begin his third state visit to the French Republic at the invitation of Macron.

The electricity generated by a home's solar panels can be temporarily stored in a BMW vehicle's battery pack, then fed back to a home's electrical system as needed.

For the second stage of the rollout, customers will be able to select a portion of their BMW EV battery's capacity to use for both charging from the grid and discharging electricity back to the grid during peak times. BMW says these functions will be available in select markets once the regulatory framework and other measures are adopted. E.ON will manage the charging process together with BMW to enable revenue generation from the transfer of energy to and from a BMW EV and the grid.

The bidirectional technology also includes vehicle to load functionality, allowing an EV to power external devices like power tools, e-bikes and camping accessories.

""We are constantly improving our range of charging products and services in order to maximize the benefit to the customer,"" said Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW, responsible for development, in a press release.

According to the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, the integration of EVs with the grid will be essential for reducing emissions, as well as for maintaining reliable electricity, reducing costs and enabling a seamless charging experience.

Last month, General Motors announced the availability of its first vehicle-to-home EV charging products. The automaker's Ultium Home V2H Enablement Kit includes a power inverter, home hub and dark start battery for delivering 9.6 kilowatts of discharge power from a GM vehicle.

BMW's next-generation Neue Klasse EVs will be built on an all-new architecture and the first models are slated to enter series production at the automaker's Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The EVs will also represent a major leap forward in both exterior and interior design, according to BMW.",utilitydive.com,news,Utility Dive,,0.1686274509803922,452878173,7,https://www.utilitydive.com/imgproxy/_clmOd4-Mu2t15VTuC_FsQyJvELNkU-ZXNklG_j5XEM/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL1A5MDU0MzY1N19oaWdoUmVzX2Jtdy12aXNpb24tbmV1ZS1rbGFzLmpwZw.webp,

In 2023, for the first time, 30% of the world's electricity was produced from renewable sources, thanks to the expansion of wind and solar energy. The milestone is even more significant in the European Union, where 44% of electricity was generated from renewable sources.

This is the conclusion of the fifth edition of the Global Electricity Review report, prepared by Ember and published today. Although the most relevant of the study is the prognosis of the researchers, who are confident that a ""new era"" of decline in the generation of fossil energy is about to begin.

In the last two decades, renewable energies have gone from representing 19% of global electricity production (in 2000) to the current figure of 30% and, as the report concludes, it has been the growth of wind energy and solar which have driven the record.

""The future of renewable energy has arrived,"" says Dave Jones, director of Ember's Global Insights program. And solar energy, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.""

Also in the last two decades, solar and wind energy have grown significantly, going from 0.2% in 2000 to 12.4% last year. This expansion has been even faster in the European Union, which accounted for 17% of the global growth in solar and wind power generation in 2023.

Of these two energy sources, solar power has established itself as the main supplier of electricity growth on a global scale and, for the second year in a row, surpassed wind power in the production of new electricity. The researchers also noted that solar generated more than twice as much new electricity as coal by 2023, while maintaining its position as the world's fastest-growing source of electricity for the ninth year in a row.

Regarding the geographical distribution, China led solar and wind generation, representing 51% and 60% respectively of the new global generation. Greece ranked second in solar electricity generation, followed by Hungary and the Netherlands. And in the specific case of Spain, the country was the eighth with the most electricity generation with solar energy and the seventh with wind power.

As a result of these changes, the group argues that the CO2 intensity of global energy generation reached a new historic low in 2023, being 12% lower than its peak in 2007. They also claim that the 'expansion of wind and solar energy would have been sufficient to cause a decrease in the emissions of the sector during 2023, if it were not for the reduction in the generation of hydroelectric energy caused by the drought.

The report indicates that, under normal conditions, a 1.1% reduction in fossil energy generation and therefore emissions would have been achieved. However, due to the deficit in hydropower caused by the drought, coal-fired electricity generation was increased to compensate, resulting in a 1% increase in emissions from the global energy sector . To state this, they rely on the fact that almost all of the increase in coal generation last year (95%) happened in four countries that were severely affected by droughts: China, India, Vietnam and Mexico.

Ember argues in its analysis that clean electricity has helped to slow the growth of fossil fuels by almost two-thirds over the past ten years, and that the data collected gives them the ""confidence"" to believe that it is about to begin a new era of reduced emissions from the electricity sector. Specifically, they project a 2% reduction in fossil energy generation on a global scale by 2024, which will lead to further reductions over the following years.

The researchers add that, as a result, half of the world's economies are at least five years beyond their fossil energy peak. In the specific case of the European Union, emissions from the electricity sector would have reached their peak in 2007 and would have decreased by 46% since then.

In this sense, the decrease in coal production that the European Union has made in the last ten years is considered important; which has been the second largest, behind the United States.

At COP28, world leaders agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, meaning that by that date 60% of the world's electricity should come from renewable sources. This would almost halve emissions from the electricity sector and would be in line with the climate objective of 1.5°C.

However, the report warns that in order to achieve these international climate change goals, the energy sector should be the first to decarbonize; and that the decrease in emissions will be conditioned by the speed with which the expansion of clean energy continues.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.3725490196078431,452874277,47,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_7b1de.png,eng-9547879

As a result of the long-term, damaging repercussions of these crisis periods, the world is hurtling towards the formation of blocs, which is against Hungary's national interests, Mr Szijjarto stated.

- he said.

There is a war in Europe, and it is taking place in Hungary's vicinity. Europe suffers from wartime inflation that's created wartime prices, which has an impact on both energy and food. The EU is facing serious economic challenges.

- he added.

In this critical situation, the importance of connectivity and cooperation between a civilized East and West is increasing. The great economic growth is in the East, not the West, and trade with China determines the performance of European economies.

The EU is losing its performance and the question is where the investment from the East will end up in Europe. This is what will determine who can be competitive, FM Szijjarto remarked.

Connections are important for Hungary, and Central Asia has also become more important in this respect. We have been building cooperation for 14 years. Back then Hungary was severely criticized, but it turned out that we were right, Mr Szijjarto added.

Trade between Hungary and Uzbekistan has increased by 86 percent since 2010, and last year it exceeded 100 million dollars. The heads of 29 companies have also travelled to Uzbekistan. Preparations are underway to install a Hungarian pharmaceutical plant and investments targeting the Asian country's food industry are also expected. The entry of OTP Bank into the Uzbek market is also creating new opportunities, and the Uzbek government is desinating a special area for Hungarians.

Technological developments in the world economy are driving global demand for electricity. This can be served by nuclear energy.

May 8 (Interfax) - A feasibility study for the Black Sea Energy project to lay a cable to supply green energy from Azerbaijan to Europe will be ready in a few months, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said.

""Azerbaijan is working actively on a project to lay an electricity cable [under the Black Sea] with partner countries, including Bulgaria,"" Aliyev said in a joint press statement with Bulgarian President Rumen Radev in Baku on Wednesday.

He said the launch of this project would enable Azerbaijan to become a supplier not only of oil and gas, but also of green energy to Europe. ""The potential for this is quite considerable, and we will talk about this, including at the COP29 conference [to be held in Azerbaijan in November 2024] at the end of this year,"" he said.

Aliyev said trade between Azerbaijan and Bulgaria had recently increased several times. ""The main reason for this is cooperation in the energy sector,"" he said.

Aliyev said at the end of April that the feasibility study for the Black Sea Energy was nearing completion. ""European countries will need additional energy, and we are working on that. As you know, the green energy cable from Caspian to the Black Sea and then further down to Europe is now in the last phase of feasibility study. As soon as the feasibility study is ready, we will start, and we are already discussing on a practical track the opportunities of connecting this cable with Central Asia. Actually, what we are talking now is that we're expanding that project. Because, it started as a Black Sea cable from the Georgian Black Sea to the Romanian Black Sea coast. We expanded it to the Caspian Sea, and now we're expanding it further down to the Eastern Caspian, to Kazakhstan,"" Aliyev said at the time.

Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania and Hungary signed an agreement in Bucharest on December 17, 2022, on strategic partnership, which includes the construction of an energy bridge from the Caucasus region to Europe. This involves laying the 1,195 km Black Sea Energy undersea cable with capacity of 1 GW to supply ""green"" electricity produced in Azerbaijan through Georgia and the Black Sea to Romania for subsequent transportation to Hungary and other European countries. A decision was reached in June for Bulgaria to join the project. Laying the cable will take three or four years. The European Commission plans to provide 2.3 billion euros for the project.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,0.2784313725490195,452864748,7,,eng-9546137

TEL AVIV, Israel, May 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enlight Renewable Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ: ENLT, TASE: ENLT) today reported financial results for the first quarter March 31, 2024. The Company's earnings webcast will be held today at 8:00 AM ET. A link to this webcast can be found at the end of this earnings release.

""Our results this quarter reflect a very robust start to 2024. Revenue grew by 27% and Adjusted EBITDA grew by 28%, driven by the strong performance of our operational assets. On the back of these strong results, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year Financial Outlook for 2024,"" said Gilad Yavetz, CEO of Enlight Renewable Energy.

""Operational performance this quarter was superb. Significantly higher energy generation at our wind projects boosted financial results, and construction plans for 2024 are on schedule. Atrisco will be entirely online by the end of 2024, with the construction of three new flagship projects in the United States set to begin during the second half of the year.""

""Industry trends remain supportive for us, especially in the U.S. Estimates for long term load growth in the U.S. are rising significantly, due to increasing demand for power from onshoring of industry, new data centers, and further penetration of EVs. This is pushing PPA pricing higher, even as equipment costs remain low. As a result, returns continue to rise on the portfolio of projects we are set to construct during the coming years.""

Overview of Financial and Operating Results: Revenue

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's revenues increased to $90m, up from $71m last year, a growth rate of 27% year over year. The Company benefited from the revenue contribution of new operational projects, as well as higher production and inflation indexation embedded in our PPAs for already operational projects. This was offset by a decline in revenues driven by lower electricity prices in Spain relative to the prices observed in the same quarter in 2023.

Since the first quarter of 2023, 517 MW and 340 MWh of projects began selling electricity, including Apex Solar in the U.S.; ACDC in Hungary; Genesis Wind in Israel; and seven of the Solar & Storage cluster units in Israel. The Company also benefited from the ramp up of project Björnberget in Sweden which was partially operational in the first quarter of last year. These projects collectively generated $21m of revenue during the first quarter of 2024, with the biggest contributors being Björnberget $7m and Genesis Wind $9m. There was no material net FX impact on the Company's revenues this quarter.

Growth in revenues was offset by the decline in electricity prices for projects where electricity is sold under a merchant model. Despite a significant increase in production, Gecama revenues fell 6% year over year to $20m, driven by lower power prices in Spain. During the first quarter last year we sold electricity at Gecama at EUR 85 per MWh versus EUR 65 per MWh for the same period this year. See below for a sensitivity analysis on how Spanish electricity prices have a limited impact on our Financial Outlook.

Finally, the accounting reclassification of the remainder of our financial asset projects in Israel to fixed asset projects boosted revenues by $3m, though at the same time removed this sum from the financial income line item.

Financial performance was well-balanced between Western Europe, Central-Eastern Europe (""CEE"") and Israel, with 64% of revenues in the first quarter of 2024 denominated in Euros, 3% in US Dollars, 1% in other European currencies, and 32% denominated in Israeli shekel.

Net Income

In the first quarter, the Company's net income decreased from $33m last year to $24m this year, a decline of 27% year over year. The drop can be ascribed to the unusually high financial income incurred during the first quarter last year. In 1Q23, we recorded a one-off $12m benefit caused by the depreciation of the Israeli Shekel on the large amount of cash the Company had received following completion of our Nasdaq IPO in February 2023. In addition, we recorded a $2m non-cash gain in 1Q24 stemming from the mark to market of interest rate hedges and a positive revaluation of foreign exchange-denominated liabilities.

Adjusted EBITDA

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA grew by 28% to $68m compared to $54m for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by the same factors which affected our revenue increase, while the company overhead increased by $1m year-on-year.

Portfolio Overview

Key changes to the Company's project portfolio during the first quarter of 2024:

A majority of our Mature Portfolio and development pipeline is located in the US, and this region will soon become our largest market. In 2024, 1.2 GW and 3.2 GWh of projects are either expected to reach commercial operation or commence construction in this region.

Atrisco, comprising 364 MW of solar and 1.2 GWh of battery, is on schedule to reach COD by the end of 2024, with the solar portion during the third quarter and the storage during the fourth quarter. The solar project is mechanically complete and commissioning work is underway. Procurement of the batteries for Atrisco Storage has concluded, and the equipment is almost all on site. Work is now underway to connect the initial circuits, while at the same time we continue to progress on closing the financing and tax equity for the storage element.

We are on target to begin construction at our Quail Ranch, Roadrunner, and Country Acres projects this year, which together total 810 MW of generation and over 2 GWh of energy storage. Country Acres has already reached ready to build status, while our other two projects are awaiting their final milestones before commencing construction. Roadrunner is awaiting final government authorizations needed to proceed, while Quail Ranch is awaiting regulatory approval of its executed PPA. We will begin procurement for all three sites in the coming months, while working in earnest on financing packages which are expected to close during the second half of 2024.

We continue to see a very supportive business environment. Costs for both solar panels and batteries have fallen significantly in recent months. Solar module and battery prices are now approximately 25 cents and $170 respectively, down by 35% since the beginning of 2023. These positive fundamentals are boosting our project returns in the U.S. during 2024 and beyond.

Finally, there has been renewed concern regarding possible new trade sanctions aimed at Asian equipment manufacturers. Clenera uses modules supplied from SE Asia and India that are audited by third parties to ensure compliance with today's UFLPA and AD/CVD rules. If additional sanctions emerge, we have contingency plans in place to limit potential supply chain impact, including use of U.S. assembled bifacial panels and batteries.

Europe

During the first quarter, the Pupin wind farm in Serbia, with a 94 MW capacity, achieved financial close through a $95m loan arranged by EBRD and Erste. The project is advancing on schedule, with construction having begun in 2Q23, and is expected to reach COD during 2H25. The Tapolca and AC/DC projects in Hungary also reached financial close with a $42m loan from Raiffeisen Bank, resulting in $29m of excess capital recycled back to Enlight. Tapolca, a solar project in Hungary with a capacity of 60 MW, is currently under construction and is on schedule to reach COD during 2H24, while AC/DC, with a generation capacity of 26 MW, is currently operating.

The Gecama Hybrid Solar project with 225 MW of solar and 220 MWh of storage capacity continues to pursue the receipt of its environmental permit from Spanish authorities, which represents the site's last major development milestone. We are commencing initial engineering work for the project, and subject to receiving the permit, we expect construction to begin during 2H24.

Moving to our operational portfolio, the Gecama Wind project in Spain sold electricity at an average price of EUR 65 per MWh during 1Q24 compared to EUR 85 per MWh last year, as prices fell significantly on the back of high volumes of country-wide renewable power generation. During the quarter, 48% of production was sold at merchant price of EUR 30 per MWh, while 52% of production was sold under a financial hedge at EUR 98 per MWh. The impact of weaker prices was offset by higher-than-usual generation volumes, as well as the hedges we put in place. The volume of electricity generated at Gecama was 20% higher than in 1Q23.

Despite the volatility of electricity prices, Enlight's hedging strategy provided significant downside protection, and will continue to do so for the rest of the year. Our EUR 100 per MWh hedge will cover 65% of Gecama's anticipated generation for the rest of 2024, and the sensitivity analysis below demonstrates that our Adjusted EBITDA (taken at the midpoint of the range presented in our Financial Outlook) is only minimally impacted by changes to Spanish electricity prices for the remainder of 2024.

On a broader level, 90% of Enlight's total generation volumes will be sold at fixed prices this year, whether via PPAs or hedges. Enlight has already begun preparing a hedging strategy for 2025. In this respect, we have entered into futures contracts covering 30% of our estimated generation output for next year at an approximate price of EUR 60 per MWh.

Israel

The build out of the Israel Solar + Storage clusters continued with the COD of Arad Valley 3, adding 30 MW and 63 MWh to this project. This is the seventh unit within the cluster, which will ultimately comprise of 12 sites in the north and center of Israel, with a total capacity of 248 MW and 593 MWh. We expect a gradual COD for the remaining five sites through the rest of this year.

Starting in January 2024, the Israeli electricity sector shifted to a fully deregulated market. Enlight continues to expand its presence in this new commercial environment, signing two new corporate PPAs for an equivalent of capacity 50 MW.

Finally, in April 2024, the Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary named Enlight Local, based on the assets acquired from Aria at the end of last year. Enlight Local will focus on Israeli municipal and agri-solar customers, providing solar and storage infrastructure to this segment of our domestic market, a fast-growing area in which until now Enlight was not active.

Financing Arrangements

During the first quarter of 2024, Enlight achieved two financial closings for projects in Central Europe.

The amount of capital raised last year places the Company in a favorable financial position for 2024, and the Company does not anticipate the need to raise equity for our expansion plan. We also note that sell downs of projects from within our pipeline - whether Mature, Advanced Development, or Early-Stage Development- are to become an increasingly important source of funding, which we intend cultivate further in both 2024 and the years ahead. The Company estimates it will generate capital gains of $15m from sell-downs, likely to be realized towards the end of this year. This figure is included in the Adjusted EBITDA portion of our 2024 financial outlook.

Balance Sheet

The Company maintains $325m of revolving credit facilities, none of which have been drawn as of the balance sheet date. These resources enhance our financial strength and provide additional flexibility to the Company as it delivers on its Mature Project portfolio.

2024 Financial Outlook

Commenting on the outlook, Enlight Chief Financial Officer Nir Yehuda noted, ""The Company exhibited robust financial performance during the first quarter. We are therefore pleased to reaffirm our Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024."" Details of the 2024 outlook include:

1 The section titled ""Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" below contains a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS financial measure discussed in this press release. A reconciliation between Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income, its most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, is contained in the tables below. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because items that impact this IFRS financial measure are not within the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. These items may include, but are not limited to, forward-looking depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, other income, finance income, finance expenses, share of losses of equity accounted investees and taxes on income. Such information may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on the Company's future financial results. We note that ""Adjusted EBITDA"" measures that we disclosed in previous filings in Israel were not comparable to ""Adjusted EBITDA"" disclosed in the release and in our future filings.

Conference Call Information

Enlight plans to hold its First Quarter 2024 Conference Call and Webcast on Wednesday, May 8, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. ET to review its financial results and business outlook. Management will deliver prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. Participants can join by dial-in or webcast:

The press release with the financial results as well as the investor presentation materials will be accessible from the Company's website prior to the conference call. Approximately one hour after completion of the live call, an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Company's investor relations website at https://enlightenergy.co.il/info/investors/.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information

We intend to announce material information to the public through the Enlight investor relations website at https://enlightenergy.co.il/info/investors, SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, and public webcasts. We use these channels to communicate with our investors, customers, and the public about our company, our offerings, and other issues. As such, we encourage investors, the media, and others to follow the channels listed above, and to review the information disclosed through such channels. Any updates to the list of disclosure channels through which we will announce information will be posted on the investor relations page of our website.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures

This release presents Adjusted EBITDA, a financial metric, which is provided as a complement to the results provided in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IFRS""). A reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial information to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure is provided in the accompanying tables found at the end of this release.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, finance expenses, taxes on income and share in losses of equity accounted investees and minus finance income and non-recurring other income. Non-recurring other income for the first quarter of 2024 included income recognized in relation to the reduction of earnout we expect to pay as part of the Clenera Acquisition and other income recognized in relation to tax credits for projects in the United States. With respect to other expense (income), as part of Enlight's strategy to accelerate growth and reduce the need for equity financing, the Company sells parts of, or entire, developed assets from time to time, and therefore includes realized gains and losses from these asset dispositions in Adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability and uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance and for planning and forecasting purposes.

Non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-IFRS financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under IFRS. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate the non-IFRS financial measures that we use differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related IFRS financial measure, Net Income, and the reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA provided below to Net Income and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Revenue of $90m, up 27% year over yearAdjusted EBITDA1 of $68m, up 28% year over yearNet income of $24m, down 26% year over yearCash flow from operations of $35m, down 36% year over yearReaffirming full year 2024 guidance

First Quarter Business Developments

High generation volumes at our wind projects more than offset the impact from low merchant prices in Spain.Our U.S. projects are on schedule. Atrisco Solar and Storage are on track for COD in 2H24. Country Acres, Roadrunner and Quail Ranch, totaling 810 MW and 2.0 GWh are fast approaching Ready to Build.Achieved financial close for European projects Pupin, Tapolca, and AC/DC, totaling 180 MW. Transactions included $137m of long-term debt and $29m of capital recycled back to Enlight.Arad Valley 3, a part of the Israel Solar + Storage cluster, reached COD. Roll out of the remaining 5 sites of the cluster is on track for the rest of this year.Project returns continue to rise, boosted by high PPA pricing and record low equipment costs.No material changes to the Mature Project portfolio since last quarter's earnings report.

""Our results this quarter reflect a very robust start to 2024. Revenue grew by 27% and Adjusted EBITDA grew by 28%, driven by the strong performance of our operational assets. On the back of these strong results, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year Financial Outlook for 2024,"" said Gilad Yavetz, CEO of Enlight Renewable Energy.

""Operational performance this quarter was superb. Significantly higher energy generation at our wind projects boosted financial results, and construction plans for 2024 are on schedule. Atrisco will be entirely online by the end of 2024, with the construction of three new flagship projects in the United States set to begin during the second half of the year.""

""Industry trends remain supportive for us, especially in the U.S. Estimates for long term load growth in the U.S. are rising significantly, due to increasing demand for power from onshoring of industry, new data centers, and further penetration of EVs. This is pushing PPA pricing higher, even as equipment costs remain low. As a result, returns continue to rise on the portfolio of projects we are set to construct during the coming years.""

Overview of Financial and Operating Results: Revenue

Loading...Loading...

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's revenues increased to $90m, up from $71m last year, a growth rate of 27% year over year. The Company benefited from the revenue contribution of new operational projects, as well as higher production and inflation indexation embedded in our PPAs for already operational projects. This was offset by a decline in revenues driven by lower electricity prices in Spain relative to the prices observed in the same quarter in 2023.

Since the first quarter of 2023, 517 MW and 340 MWh of projects began selling electricity, including Apex Solar in the U.S.; ACDC in Hungary; Genesis Wind in Israel; and seven of the Solar & Storage cluster units in Israel. The Company also benefited from the ramp up of project Björnberget in Sweden which was partially operational in the first quarter of last year. These projects collectively generated $21m of revenue during the first quarter of 2024, with the biggest contributors being Björnberget $7m and Genesis Wind $9m. There was no material net FX impact on the Company's revenues this quarter.

Growth in revenues was offset by the decline in electricity prices for projects where electricity is sold under a merchant model. Despite a significant increase in production, Gecama revenues fell 6% year over year to $20m, driven by lower power prices in Spain. During the first quarter last year we sold electricity at Gecama at EUR 85 per MWh versus EUR 65 per MWh for the same period this year. See below for a sensitivity analysis on how Spanish electricity prices have a limited impact on our Financial Outlook.

Finally, the accounting reclassification of the remainder of our financial asset projects in Israel to fixed asset projects boosted revenues by $3m, though at the same time removed this sum from the financial income line item.

Financial performance was well-balanced between Western Europe, Central-Eastern Europe (""CEE"") and Israel, with 64% of revenues in the first quarter of 2024 denominated in Euros, 3% in US Dollars, 1% in other European currencies, and 32% denominated in Israeli shekel.

Net Income

In the first quarter, the Company's net income decreased from $33m last year to $24m this year, a decline of 27% year over year. The drop can be ascribed to the unusually high financial income incurred during the first quarter last year. In 1Q23, we recorded a one-off $12m benefit caused by the depreciation of the Israeli Shekel on the large amount of cash the Company had received following completion of our Nasdaq IPO in February 2023. In addition, we recorded a $2m non-cash gain in 1Q24 stemming from the mark to market of interest rate hedges and a positive revaluation of foreign exchange-denominated liabilities.

Adjusted EBITDA1

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA grew by 28% to $68m compared to $54m for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by the same factors which affected our revenue increase, while the company overhead increased by $1m year-on-year.

Portfolio Overview2

Key changes to the Company's project portfolio during the first quarter of 2024:

Operational portfolio grew by 32 MW and 63 MWhNo material changes to the Mature Project portfolio

2 As of May 8, 2024, the ""Approval Date""

United States

A majority of our Mature Portfolio and development pipeline is located in the US, and this region will soon become our largest market. In 2024, 1.2 GW and 3.2 GWh of projects are either expected to reach commercial operation or commence construction in this region.

Atrisco, comprising 364 MW of solar and 1.2 GWh of battery, is on schedule to reach COD by the end of 2024, with the solar portion during the third quarter and the storage during the fourth quarter. The solar project is mechanically complete and commissioning work is underway. Procurement of the batteries for Atrisco Storage has concluded, and the equipment is almost all on site. Work is now underway to connect the initial circuits, while at the same time we continue to progress on closing the financing and tax equity for the storage element.

We are on target to begin construction at our Quail Ranch, Roadrunner, and Country Acres projects this year, which together total 810 MW of generation and over 2 GWh of energy storage. Country Acres has already reached ready to build status, while our other two projects are awaiting their final milestones before commencing construction. Roadrunner is awaiting final government authorizations needed to proceed, while Quail Ranch is awaiting regulatory approval of its executed PPA. We will begin procurement for all three sites in the coming months, while working in earnest on financing packages which are expected to close during the second half of 2024.

We continue to see a very supportive business environment. Costs for both solar panels and batteries have fallen significantly in recent months. Solar module and battery prices are now approximately 25 cents and $170 respectively, down by 35% since the beginning of 2023. These positive fundamentals are boosting our project returns in the U.S. during 2024 and beyond.

Finally, there has been renewed concern regarding possible new trade sanctions aimed at Asian equipment manufacturers. Clenera uses modules supplied from SE Asia and India that are audited by third parties to ensure compliance with today's UFLPA and AD/CVD rules. If additional sanctions emerge, we have contingency plans in place to limit potential supply chain impact, including use of U.S. assembled bifacial panels and batteries.

Europe

During the first quarter, the Pupin wind farm in Serbia, with a 94 MW capacity, achieved financial close through a $95m loan arranged by EBRD and Erste. The project is advancing on schedule, with construction having begun in 2Q23, and is expected to reach COD during 2H25. The Tapolca and AC/DC projects in Hungary also reached financial close with a $42m loan from Raiffeisen Bank, resulting in $29m of excess capital recycled back to Enlight. Tapolca, a solar project in Hungary with a capacity of 60 MW, is currently under construction and is on schedule to reach COD during 2H24, while AC/DC, with a generation capacity of 26 MW, is currently operating.

The Gecama Hybrid Solar project with 225 MW of solar and 220 MWh of storage capacity continues to pursue the receipt of its environmental permit from Spanish authorities, which represents the site's last major development milestone. We are commencing initial engineering work for the project, and subject to receiving the permit, we expect construction to begin during 2H24.

Moving to our operational portfolio, the Gecama Wind project in Spain sold electricity at an average price of EUR 65 per MWh during 1Q24 compared to EUR 85 per MWh last year, as prices fell significantly on the back of high volumes of country-wide renewable power generation. During the quarter, 48% of production was sold at merchant price of EUR 30 per MWh, while 52% of production was sold under a financial hedge at EUR 98 per MWh. The impact of weaker prices was offset by higher-than-usual generation volumes, as well as the hedges we put in place. The volume of electricity generated at Gecama was 20% higher than in 1Q23.

Despite the volatility of electricity prices, Enlight's hedging strategy provided significant downside protection, and will continue to do so for the rest of the year. Our EUR 100 per MWh hedge will cover 65% of Gecama's anticipated generation for the rest of 2024, and the sensitivity analysis below demonstrates that our Adjusted EBITDA (taken at the midpoint of the range presented in our Financial Outlook) is only minimally impacted by changes to Spanish electricity prices for the remainder of 2024.

On a broader level, 90% of Enlight's total generation volumes will be sold at fixed prices this year, whether via PPAs or hedges. Enlight has already begun preparing a hedging strategy for 2025. In this respect, we have entered into futures contracts covering 30% of our estimated generation output for next year at an approximate price of EUR 60 per MWh.

Differential from initial 2024 Company budget forecasts of EUR 68.5 / MWh on which the Company's 2024 Financial Outlook is based at the midpoint.

Analysis based on the midpoint of the Company's 2024 financial outlook of $235-$255 in Adjusted EBITDA and a capture rate of 89%. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because items that impact this IFRS financial measure are not within the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted.

Israel

The build out of the Israel Solar + Storage clusters continued with the COD of Arad Valley 3, adding 30 MW and 63 MWh to this project. This is the seventh unit within the cluster, which will ultimately comprise of 12 sites in the north and center of Israel, with a total capacity of 248 MW and 593 MWh. We expect a gradual COD for the remaining five sites through the rest of this year.

Starting in January 2024, the Israeli electricity sector shifted to a fully deregulated market. Enlight continues to expand its presence in this new commercial environment, signing two new corporate PPAs for an equivalent of capacity 50 MW.

Finally, in April 2024, the Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary named Enlight Local, based on the assets acquired from Aria at the end of last year. Enlight Local will focus on Israeli municipal and agri-solar customers, providing solar and storage infrastructure to this segment of our domestic market, a fast-growing area in which until now Enlight was not active.

Financing Arrangements

During the first quarter of 2024, Enlight achieved two financial closings for projects in Central Europe.

Project Pupin in Serbia: EBRD and Erste granted a $95m financing package for the construction of the Pupin wind project. It is structured as a fully amortizing 15-year term from the date of COD, with an interest margin of 3.1% to 3.5% above 3-month Euribor.Projects Tapolca and AC/DC in Hungary: Raiffeisen Bank granted a $42m senior project financing facility for the construction of the Tapolca solar project, and the recycling of excess equity in AC/DC. The debt is structured with a 10-year tenor with a 25%-35% balloon payment at the end of the term coupled with an interest margin of 3.0% to 3.4% above 3-month Euribor.

The amount of capital raised last year places the Company in a favorable financial position for 2024, and the Company does not anticipate the need to raise equity for our expansion plan. We also note that sell downs of projects from within our pipeline - whether Mature, Advanced Development, or Early-Stage Development- are to become an increasingly important source of funding, which we intend cultivate further in both 2024 and the years ahead. The Company estimates it will generate capital gains of $15m from sell-downs, likely to be realized towards the end of this year. This figure is included in the Adjusted EBITDA portion of our 2024 financial outlook.

Balance Sheet

The Company maintains $325m of revolving credit facilities, none of which have been drawn as of the balance sheet date. These resources enhance our financial strength and provide additional flexibility to the Company as it delivers on its Mature Project portfolio.

2024 Financial Outlook

Commenting on the outlook, Enlight Chief Financial Officer Nir Yehuda noted, ""The Company exhibited robust financial performance during the first quarter. We are therefore pleased to reaffirm our Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024."" Details of the 2024 outlook include:

Revenue between $335m and $360mAdjusted EBITDA1 between $235m and $255m90% of 2024's expected generation output will be sold at fixed prices either through hedges or PPAs.

1 The section titled ""Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" below contains a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS financial measure discussed in this press release. A reconciliation between Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income, its most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, is contained in the tables below. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because items that impact this IFRS financial measure are not within the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. These items may include, but are not limited to, forward-looking depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, other income, finance income, finance expenses, share of losses of equity accounted investees and taxes on income. Such information may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on the Company's future financial results. We note that ""Adjusted EBITDA"" measures that we disclosed in previous filings in Israel were not comparable to ""Adjusted EBITDA"" disclosed in the release and in our future filings.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information

We intend to announce material information to the public through the Enlight investor relations website at https://enlightenergy.co.il/info/investors, SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, and public webcasts. We use these channels to communicate with our investors, customers, and the public about our company, our offerings, and other issues. As such, we encourage investors, the media, and others to follow the channels listed above, and to review the information disclosed through such channels. Any updates to the list of disclosure channels through which we will announce information will be posted on the investor relations page of our website.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures

This release presents Adjusted EBITDA, a financial metric, which is provided as a complement to the results provided in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IFRS""). A reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial information to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure is provided in the accompanying tables found at the end of this release.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, finance expenses, taxes on income and share in losses of equity accounted investees and minus finance income and non-recurring other income. Non-recurring other income for the first quarter of 2024 included income recognized in relation to the reduction of earnout we expect to pay as part of the Clenera Acquisition and other income recognized in relation to tax credits for projects in the United States. With respect to other expense (income), as part of Enlight's strategy to accelerate growth and reduce the need for equity financing, the Company sells parts of, or entire, developed assets from time to time, and therefore includes realized gains and losses from these asset dispositions in Adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability and uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance and for planning and forecasting purposes.

Non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-IFRS financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under IFRS. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate the non-IFRS financial measures that we use differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related IFRS financial measure, Net Income, and the reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA provided below to Net Income and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Overview of Financial and Operating Results: Revenue

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's revenues increased to $90m, up from $71m last year, a growth rate of 27% year over year. The Company benefited from the revenue contribution of new operational projects, as well as higher production and inflation indexation embedded in our PPAs for already operational projects. This was offset by a decline in revenues driven by lower electricity prices in Spain relative to the prices observed in the same quarter in 2023.

Since the first quarter of 2023, 517 MW and 340 MWh of projects began selling electricity, including Apex Solar in the U.S.; ACDC in Hungary; Genesis Wind in Israel; and seven of the Solar & Storage cluster units in Israel. The Company also benefited from the ramp up of project Björnberget in Sweden which was partially operational in the first quarter of last year. These projects collectively generated $21m of revenue during the first quarter of 2024, with the biggest contributors being Björnberget $7m and Genesis Wind $9m. There was no material net FX impact on the Company's revenues this quarter.

Growth in revenues was offset by the decline in electricity prices for projects where electricity is sold under a merchant model. Despite a significant increase in production, Gecama revenues fell 6% year over year to $20m, driven by lower power prices in Spain. During the first quarter last year we sold electricity at Gecama at EUR 85 per MWh versus EUR 65 per MWh for the same period this year. See below for a sensitivity analysis on how Spanish electricity prices have a limited impact on our Financial Outlook.

Finally, the accounting reclassification of the remainder of our financial asset projects in Israel to fixed asset projects boosted revenues by $3m, though at the same time removed this sum from the financial income line item.

Financial performance was well-balanced between Western Europe, Central-Eastern Europe (""CEE"") and Israel, with 64% of revenues in the first quarter of 2024 denominated in Euros, 3% in US Dollars, 1% in other European currencies, and 32% denominated in Israeli shekel.

Net Income

In the first quarter, the Company's net income decreased from $33m last year to $24m this year, a decline of 27% year over year. The drop can be ascribed to the unusually high financial income incurred during the first quarter last year. In 1Q23, we recorded a one-off $12m benefit caused by the depreciation of the Israeli Shekel on the large amount of cash the Company had received following completion of our Nasdaq IPO in February 2023. In addition, we recorded a $2m non-cash gain in 1Q24 stemming from the mark to market of interest rate hedges and a positive revaluation of foreign exchange-denominated liabilities.

Adjusted EBITDA

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA grew by 28% to $68m compared to $54m for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by the same factors which affected our revenue increase, while the company overhead increased by $1m year-on-year.

Portfolio Overview

Key changes to the Company's project portfolio during the first quarter of 2024:

A majority of our Mature Portfolio and development pipeline is located in the US, and this region will soon become our largest market. In 2024, 1.2 GW and 3.2 GWh of projects are either expected to reach commercial operation or commence construction in this region.

Atrisco, comprising 364 MW of solar and 1.2 GWh of battery, is on schedule to reach COD by the end of 2024, with the solar portion during the third quarter and the storage during the fourth quarter. The solar project is mechanically complete and commissioning work is underway. Procurement of the batteries for Atrisco Storage has concluded, and the equipment is almost all on site. Work is now underway to connect the initial circuits, while at the same time we continue to progress on closing the financing and tax equity for the storage element.

We are on target to begin construction at our Quail Ranch, Roadrunner, and Country Acres projects this year, which together total 810 MW of generation and over 2 GWh of energy storage. Country Acres has already reached ready to build status, while our other two projects are awaiting their final milestones before commencing construction. Roadrunner is awaiting final government authorizations needed to proceed, while Quail Ranch is awaiting regulatory approval of its executed PPA. We will begin procurement for all three sites in the coming months, while working in earnest on financing packages which are expected to close during the second half of 2024.

We continue to see a very supportive business environment. Costs for both solar panels and batteries have fallen significantly in recent months. Solar module and battery prices are now approximately 25 cents and $170 respectively, down by 35% since the beginning of 2023. These positive fundamentals are boosting our project returns in the U.S. during 2024 and beyond.

Finally, there has been renewed concern regarding possible new trade sanctions aimed at Asian equipment manufacturers. Clenera uses modules supplied from SE Asia and India that are audited by third parties to ensure compliance with today's UFLPA and AD/CVD rules. If additional sanctions emerge, we have contingency plans in place to limit potential supply chain impact, including use of U.S. assembled bifacial panels and batteries.

Europe

During the first quarter, the Pupin wind farm in Serbia, with a 94 MW capacity, achieved financial close through a $95m loan arranged by EBRD and Erste. The project is advancing on schedule, with construction having begun in 2Q23, and is expected to reach COD during 2H25. The Tapolca and AC/DC projects in Hungary also reached financial close with a $42m loan from Raiffeisen Bank, resulting in $29m of excess capital recycled back to Enlight. Tapolca, a solar project in Hungary with a capacity of 60 MW, is currently under construction and is on schedule to reach COD during 2H24, while AC/DC, with a generation capacity of 26 MW, is currently operating.

The Gecama Hybrid Solar project with 225 MW of solar and 220 MWh of storage capacity continues to pursue the receipt of its environmental permit from Spanish authorities, which represents the site's last major development milestone. We are commencing initial engineering work for the project, and subject to receiving the permit, we expect construction to begin during 2H24.

Moving to our operational portfolio, the Gecama Wind project in Spain sold electricity at an average price of EUR 65 per MWh during 1Q24 compared to EUR 85 per MWh last year, as prices fell significantly on the back of high volumes of country-wide renewable power generation. During the quarter, 48% of production was sold at merchant price of EUR 30 per MWh, while 52% of production was sold under a financial hedge at EUR 98 per MWh. The impact of weaker prices was offset by higher-than-usual generation volumes, as well as the hedges we put in place. The volume of electricity generated at Gecama was 20% higher than in 1Q23.

Despite the volatility of electricity prices, Enlight's hedging strategy provided significant downside protection, and will continue to do so for the rest of the year. Our EUR 100 per MWh hedge will cover 65% of Gecama's anticipated generation for the rest of 2024, and the sensitivity analysis below demonstrates that our Adjusted EBITDA (taken at the midpoint of the range presented in our Financial Outlook) is only minimally impacted by changes to Spanish electricity prices for the remainder of 2024.

On a broader level, 90% of Enlight's total generation volumes will be sold at fixed prices this year, whether via PPAs or hedges. Enlight has already begun preparing a hedging strategy for 2025. In this respect, we have entered into futures contracts covering 30% of our estimated generation output for next year at an approximate price of EUR 60 per MWh.

Israel

The build out of the Israel Solar + Storage clusters continued with the COD of Arad Valley 3, adding 30 MW and 63 MWh to this project. This is the seventh unit within the cluster, which will ultimately comprise of 12 sites in the north and center of Israel, with a total capacity of 248 MW and 593 MWh. We expect a gradual COD for the remaining five sites through the rest of this year.

Starting in January 2024, the Israeli electricity sector shifted to a fully deregulated market. Enlight continues to expand its presence in this new commercial environment, signing two new corporate PPAs for an equivalent of capacity 50 MW.

Finally, in April 2024, the Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary named Enlight Local, based on the assets acquired from Aria at the end of last year. Enlight Local will focus on Israeli municipal and agri-solar customers, providing solar and storage infrastructure to this segment of our domestic market, a fast-growing area in which until now Enlight was not active.

Financing Arrangements

During the first quarter of 2024, Enlight achieved two financial closings for projects in Central Europe.

The amount of capital raised last year places the Company in a favorable financial position for 2024, and the Company does not anticipate the need to raise equity for our expansion plan. We also note that sell downs of projects from within our pipeline - whether Mature, Advanced Development, or Early-Stage Development- are to become an increasingly important source of funding, which we intend cultivate further in both 2024 and the years ahead. The Company estimates it will generate capital gains of $15m from sell-downs, likely to be realized towards the end of this year. This figure is included in the Adjusted EBITDA portion of our 2024 financial outlook.

Balance Sheet

The Company maintains $325m of revolving credit facilities, none of which have been drawn as of the balance sheet date. These resources enhance our financial strength and provide additional flexibility to the Company as it delivers on its Mature Project portfolio.

2024 Financial Outlook

Commenting on the outlook, Enlight Chief Financial Officer Nir Yehuda noted, ""The Company exhibited robust financial performance during the first quarter. We are therefore pleased to reaffirm our Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024."" Details of the 2024 outlook include:

1 The section titled ""Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" below contains a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS financial measure discussed in this press release. A reconciliation between Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income, its most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, is contained in the tables below. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because items that impact this IFRS financial measure are not within the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. These items may include, but are not limited to, forward-looking depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, other income, finance income, finance expenses, share of losses of equity accounted investees and taxes on income. Such information may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on the Company's future financial results. We note that ""Adjusted EBITDA"" measures that we disclosed in previous filings in Israel were not comparable to ""Adjusted EBITDA"" disclosed in the release and in our future filings.

Conference Call Information

Enlight plans to hold its First Quarter 2024 Conference Call and Webcast on Wednesday, May 8, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. ET to review its financial results and business outlook. Management will deliver prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. Participants can join by dial-in or webcast:

The press release with the financial results as well as the investor presentation materials will be accessible from the Company's website prior to the conference call. Approximately one hour after completion of the live call, an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Company's investor relations website at https://enlightenergy.co.il/info/investors/.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information

We intend to announce material information to the public through the Enlight investor relations website at https://enlightenergy.co.il/info/investors, SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, and public webcasts. We use these channels to communicate with our investors, customers, and the public about our company, our offerings, and other issues. As such, we encourage investors, the media, and others to follow the channels listed above, and to review the information disclosed through such channels. Any updates to the list of disclosure channels through which we will announce information will be posted on the investor relations page of our website.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures

This release presents Adjusted EBITDA, a financial metric, which is provided as a complement to the results provided in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IFRS""). A reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial information to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure is provided in the accompanying tables found at the end of this release.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, finance expenses, taxes on income and share in losses of equity accounted investees and minus finance income and non-recurring other income. Non-recurring other income for the first quarter of 2024 included income recognized in relation to the reduction of earnout we expect to pay as part of the Clenera Acquisition and other income recognized in relation to tax credits for projects in the United States. With respect to other expense (income), as part of Enlight's strategy to accelerate growth and reduce the need for equity financing, the Company sells parts of, or entire, developed assets from time to time, and therefore includes realized gains and losses from these asset dispositions in Adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability and uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance and for planning and forecasting purposes.

Non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-IFRS financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under IFRS. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate the non-IFRS financial measures that we use differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related IFRS financial measure, Net Income, and the reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA provided below to Net Income and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Overview of Financial and Operating Results: Revenue

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's revenues increased to $90m, up from $71m last year, a growth rate of 27% year over year. The Company benefited from the revenue contribution of new operational projects, as well as higher production and inflation indexation embedded in our PPAs for already operational projects. This was offset by a decline in revenues driven by lower electricity prices in Spain relative to the prices observed in the same quarter in 2023.

Since the first quarter of 2023, 517 MW and 340 MWh of projects began selling electricity, including Apex Solar in the U.S.; ACDC in Hungary; Genesis Wind in Israel; and seven of the Solar & Storage cluster units in Israel. The Company also benefited from the ramp up of project Björnberget in Sweden which was partially operational in the first quarter of last year. These projects collectively generated $21m of revenue during the first quarter of 2024, with the biggest contributors being Björnberget $7m and Genesis Wind $9m. There was no material net FX impact on the Company's revenues this quarter.

Growth in revenues was offset by the decline in electricity prices for projects where electricity is sold under a merchant model. Despite a significant increase in production, Gecama revenues fell 6% year over year to $20m, driven by lower power prices in Spain. During the first quarter last year we sold electricity at Gecama at EUR 85 per MWh versus EUR 65 per MWh for the same period this year. See below for a sensitivity analysis on how Spanish electricity prices have a limited impact on our Financial Outlook.

Finally, the accounting reclassification of the remainder of our financial asset projects in Israel to fixed asset projects boosted revenues by $3m, though at the same time removed this sum from the financial income line item.

Financial performance was well-balanced between Western Europe, Central-Eastern Europe (""CEE"") and Israel, with 64% of revenues in the first quarter of 2024 denominated in Euros, 3% in US Dollars, 1% in other European currencies, and 32% denominated in Israeli shekel.

Net Income

In the first quarter, the Company's net income decreased from $33m last year to $24m this year, a decline of 27% year over year. The drop can be ascribed to the unusually high financial income incurred during the first quarter last year. In 1Q23, we recorded a one-off $12m benefit caused by the depreciation of the Israeli Shekel on the large amount of cash the Company had received following completion of our Nasdaq IPO in February 2023. In addition, we recorded a $2m non-cash gain in 1Q24 stemming from the mark to market of interest rate hedges and a positive revaluation of foreign exchange-denominated liabilities.

Adjusted EBITDA

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA grew by 28% to $68m compared to $54m for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by the same factors which affected our revenue increase, while the company overhead increased by $1m year-on-year.

Portfolio Overview

Key changes to the Company's project portfolio during the first quarter of 2024:

A majority of our Mature Portfolio and development pipeline is located in the US, and this region will soon become our largest market. In 2024, 1.2 GW and 3.2 GWh of projects are either expected to reach commercial operation or commence construction in this region.

Atrisco, comprising 364 MW of solar and 1.2 GWh of battery, is on schedule to reach COD by the end of 2024, with the solar portion during the third quarter and the storage during the fourth quarter. The solar project is mechanically complete and commissioning work is underway. Procurement of the batteries for Atrisco Storage has concluded, and the equipment is almost all on site. Work is now underway to connect the initial circuits, while at the same time we continue to progress on closing the financing and tax equity for the storage element.

We are on target to begin construction at our Quail Ranch, Roadrunner, and Country Acres projects this year, which together total 810 MW of generation and over 2 GWh of energy storage. Country Acres has already reached ready to build status, while our other two projects are awaiting their final milestones before commencing construction. Roadrunner is awaiting final government authorizations needed to proceed, while Quail Ranch is awaiting regulatory approval of its executed PPA. We will begin procurement for all three sites in the coming months, while working in earnest on financing packages which are expected to close during the second half of 2024.

We continue to see a very supportive business environment. Costs for both solar panels and batteries have fallen significantly in recent months. Solar module and battery prices are now approximately 25 cents and $170 respectively, down by 35% since the beginning of 2023. These positive fundamentals are boosting our project returns in the U.S. during 2024 and beyond.

Finally, there has been renewed concern regarding possible new trade sanctions aimed at Asian equipment manufacturers. Clenera uses modules supplied from SE Asia and India that are audited by third parties to ensure compliance with today's UFLPA and AD/CVD rules. If additional sanctions emerge, we have contingency plans in place to limit potential supply chain impact, including use of U.S. assembled bifacial panels and batteries.

Europe

During the first quarter, the Pupin wind farm in Serbia, with a 94 MW capacity, achieved financial close through a $95m loan arranged by EBRD and Erste. The project is advancing on schedule, with construction having begun in 2Q23, and is expected to reach COD during 2H25. The Tapolca and AC/DC projects in Hungary also reached financial close with a $42m loan from Raiffeisen Bank, resulting in $29m of excess capital recycled back to Enlight. Tapolca, a solar project in Hungary with a capacity of 60 MW, is currently under construction and is on schedule to reach COD during 2H24, while AC/DC, with a generation capacity of 26 MW, is currently operating.

The Gecama Hybrid Solar project with 225 MW of solar and 220 MWh of storage capacity continues to pursue the receipt of its environmental permit from Spanish authorities, which represents the site's last major development milestone. We are commencing initial engineering work for the project, and subject to receiving the permit, we expect construction to begin during 2H24.

Moving to our operational portfolio, the Gecama Wind project in Spain sold electricity at an average price of EUR 65 per MWh during 1Q24 compared to EUR 85 per MWh last year, as prices fell significantly on the back of high volumes of country-wide renewable power generation. During the quarter, 48% of production was sold at merchant price of EUR 30 per MWh, while 52% of production was sold under a financial hedge at EUR 98 per MWh. The impact of weaker prices was offset by higher-than-usual generation volumes, as well as the hedges we put in place. The volume of electricity generated at Gecama was 20% higher than in 1Q23.

Despite the volatility of electricity prices, Enlight's hedging strategy provided significant downside protection, and will continue to do so for the rest of the year. Our EUR 100 per MWh hedge will cover 65% of Gecama's anticipated generation for the rest of 2024, and the sensitivity analysis below demonstrates that our Adjusted EBITDA (taken at the midpoint of the range presented in our Financial Outlook) is only minimally impacted by changes to Spanish electricity prices for the remainder of 2024.

On a broader level, 90% of Enlight's total generation volumes will be sold at fixed prices this year, whether via PPAs or hedges. Enlight has already begun preparing a hedging strategy for 2025. In this respect, we have entered into futures contracts covering 30% of our estimated generation output for next year at an approximate price of EUR 60 per MWh.

The build out of the Israel Solar + Storage clusters continued with the COD of Arad Valley 3, adding 30 MW and 63 MWh to this project. This is the seventh unit within the cluster, which will ultimately comprise of 12 sites in the north and center of Israel, with a total capacity of 248 MW and 593 MWh. We expect a gradual COD for the remaining five sites through the rest of this year.

Starting in January 2024, the Israeli electricity sector shifted to a fully deregulated market. Enlight continues to expand its presence in this new commercial environment, signing two new corporate PPAs for an equivalent of capacity 50 MW.

Finally, in April 2024, the Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary named Enlight Local, based on the assets acquired from Aria at the end of last year. Enlight Local will focus on Israeli municipal and agri-solar customers, providing solar and storage infrastructure to this segment of our domestic market, a fast-growing area in which until now Enlight was not active.

Financing Arrangements

During the first quarter of 2024, Enlight achieved two financial closings for projects in Central Europe.

The amount of capital raised last year places the Company in a favorable financial position for 2024, and the Company does not anticipate the need to raise equity for our expansion plan. We also note that sell downs of projects from within our pipeline - whether Mature, Advanced Development, or Early-Stage Development- are to become an increasingly important source of funding, which we intend cultivate further in both 2024 and the years ahead. The Company estimates it will generate capital gains of $15m from sell-downs, likely to be realized towards the end of this year. This figure is included in the Adjusted EBITDA portion of our 2024 financial outlook.

Balance Sheet

The Company maintains $325m of revolving credit facilities, none of which have been drawn as of the balance sheet date. These resources enhance our financial strength and provide additional flexibility to the Company as it delivers on its Mature Project portfolio.

2024 Financial Outlook

Commenting on the outlook, Enlight Chief Financial Officer Nir Yehuda noted, ""The Company exhibited robust financial performance during the first quarter. We are therefore pleased to reaffirm our Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024."" Details of the 2024 outlook include:

1 The section titled ""Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" below contains a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS financial measure discussed in this press release. A reconciliation between Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income, its most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, is contained in the tables below. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because items that impact this IFRS financial measure are not within the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. These items may include, but are not limited to, forward-looking depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, other income, finance income, finance expenses, share of losses of equity accounted investees and taxes on income. Such information may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on the Company's future financial results. We note that ""Adjusted EBITDA"" measures that we disclosed in previous filings in Israel were not comparable to ""Adjusted EBITDA"" disclosed in the release and in our future filings.

Conference Call Information

Enlight plans to hold its First Quarter 2024 Conference Call and Webcast on Wednesday, May 8, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. ET to review its financial results and business outlook. Management will deliver prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. Participants can join by dial-in or webcast:

The press release with the financial results as well as the investor presentation materials will be accessible from the Company's website prior to the conference call. Approximately one hour after completion of the live call, an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Company's investor relations website at https://enlightenergy.co.il/info/investors/.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information

We intend to announce material information to the public through the Enlight investor relations website at https://enlightenergy.co.il/info/investors, SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, and public webcasts. We use these channels to communicate with our investors, customers, and the public about our company, our offerings, and other issues. As such, we encourage investors, the media, and others to follow the channels listed above, and to review the information disclosed through such channels. Any updates to the list of disclosure channels through which we will announce information will be posted on the investor relations page of our website.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures

This release presents Adjusted EBITDA, a financial metric, which is provided as a complement to the results provided in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IFRS""). A reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial information to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure is provided in the accompanying tables found at the end of this release.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, finance expenses, taxes on income and share in losses of equity accounted investees and minus finance income and non-recurring other income. Non-recurring other income for the first quarter of 2024 included income recognized in relation to the reduction of earnout we expect to pay as part of the Clenera Acquisition and other income recognized in relation to tax credits for projects in the United States. With respect to other expense (income), as part of Enlight's strategy to accelerate growth and reduce the need for equity financing, the Company sells parts of, or entire, developed assets from time to time, and therefore includes realized gains and losses from these asset dispositions in Adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability and uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance and for planning and forecasting purposes.

Non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-IFRS financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under IFRS. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate the non-IFRS financial measures that we use differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related IFRS financial measure, Net Income, and the reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA provided below to Net Income and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Xi, who is on a six-day trip to France, Serbia and Hungary through Friday, said China regards Europe as an important dimension in its major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics and an important partner on its path toward Chinese modernization.

PARTNERS FOR COOPERATION

China-EU cooperation is ""complementary and mutually beneficial"" in essence, Xi said during a trilateral meeting in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

At the meeting held at Elysee Palace, Xi said that China-EU relations enjoy strong endogenous driving force and bright prospects of development, and this relationship does not target any third party, nor should it be dependent on or dictated by any third party.

The two sides have extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation in green and digital transition, Xi said, noting it is ""necessary"" for them to properly address economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultation, and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns.

""The EU is a pillar of the global economy and its members are some of China's largest trading partners,"" said Keith Bennett, an international relations consultant in London.

""Therefore, whether from the standpoint of bilateral economic and political relations, world peace and security, or major-country diplomacy, China-Europe relations are a key part of the global order,"" said Bennett.

Despite skepticism from some quarters in Europe about the benefits of trade and economic cooperation with China, empirical evidence highlights the fruitful results of China-EU economic and trade cooperation in the past decades.

Official data show that the EU stands as China's second-largest trading partner, ranking high in both imports and exports. Likewise, China is the EU's second-largest trading partner, primary source of imports, and third-largest export destination.

Meanwhile, Chinese and European enterprises continue to be upbeat about each other's markets, as statistics showed that the stock of two-way investment has exceeded 250 billion U.S. dollars.

""I believe that the economic cooperation between Europe and China is something very important. China is strong, and that is why Europe has to develop itself and be strong also,"" Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of the LVMH group, told Xinhua on Monday before the closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

When addressing the entrepreneurs at the closing ceremony, Xi urged the EU to join China to ""oppose attempts to turn business relations into political, ideological or security issues.""

""We should turn China and Europe into each other's key partners for business cooperation, priority partners for cooperation in science and technology, and trustworthy partners for cooperation in industrial and supply chains,"" Xi said.

NO SUCH THING AS ""CHINA'S OVERCAPACITY""

Xi's remarks came as Washington is maneuvering to rally its allies in the West to ""de-risk"" from China, and slow down the country's high-tech progress, alongside escalating protectionist rhetoric concerning the so-called ""Chinese overcapacity"" in clean energy sectors.

In the trilateral meeting with French and EU leaders, Xi rejected the claim of ""China's overcapacity"" from the perspective of comparative advantage and in light of global demand.

""China's new energy industry has made real progress in open competition and represents advanced production capacity. It not only increases global supply and alleviates the pressure of global inflation, but also contributes significantly to global climate response and green transition,"" Xi said.

Amid complaints from some Western politicians about China's electric vehicles disrupting ""global prices,"" even prominent U.S. media outlets like Bloomberg have noted that the primary concern for advanced economies revolves around the efficiency and competitiveness of Chinese electric carmakers. This encompasses factors such as their technological expertise and modern transportation infrastructure.

As to the ""overcapacity problem,"" studies have shown that the clean energy sector faces significant challenges in meeting global demand.

At the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.

In 2023, a year with a record-high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.

""On clean energy, China is a partner for us,"" Luc Remont, chairman and CEO of the French national electricity company EDF, told Xinhua before Monday's closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

""The Chinese clean energy industry is welcomed in Europe to expand its capacities within Europe as well to serve the European market. Simultaneously, European industries are actively investing in China to bolster capacities within the country,"" Remont said.

GLOBAL CHALLENGES

Xi's trip is his first visit to Europe in nearly five years, and coincides with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France.

The two sides should stay committed to the spirit that guided the establishment of their diplomatic ties, namely, independence, mutual understanding, long-term vision and mutual benefit, and enrich it with new features of the new era, Xi said during talks with Macron at Elysee Palace.

Noting that history has proven time and again that at the end of the day, conflicts can only be resolved through negotiation, Xi said when he jointly met the press with Macron that China calls on all parties to resume engagement and dialogue to build mutual trust.

As the world goes through transformation and turbulence not seen in a century, China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a ""new Cold War"" or bloc confrontation, he said.

Xi pointed out that today's world is far from being tranquil. ""China and France, as permanent members of the UN Security Council, should speak out for peaceful settlement of hotspot issues and contribute to a world of lasting peace and common security. China will work with France to advocate, on the occasion of the Paris Olympic Games, a cessation of hostilities around the world during the Games,"" he said.

""The fact that France and China, who are both permanent members of the Security Council, can work together is very important, given the reality that the world is facing two conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza,"" said Pascal Boniface, founding director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

China and France have also long collaborated on combating climate change and environmental degradation, said Boniface, adding that he is glad to witness both sides' efforts to promote a more peaceful world and strengthen multilateralism, which is currently facing significant challenges.

The Chinese president said in a written speech upon arrival that he hopes China and France will light up their way forward with the torch of history, open a brighter future of China-France relations and make new contributions to world peace, stability and development.

""I hope this visit will help cement our long-standing friendship, enhance political trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields,"" he said, adding that it is a great pleasure to begin his third state visit to the French Republic at the invitation of Macron.

Back in 2014 and 2019, Xi paid two visits to France, both in spring, to celebrate the 50th and 55th anniversaries of diplomatic relations together with the people of France.",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,0.2784313725490195,452858056,1,,

This is the fifth massive missile-drone attack on Ukrainian energy facilities since March 22, said Ukrenergo.

Ukrenergo said the strike damaged generation facilities, where the Shahed kamikaze drones damaged the equipment of one of its facilities in the central region, and power in the region is currently supplied by backup systems.

Xi, who is on a six-day trip to France, Serbia and Hungary through Friday, said China regards Europe as an important dimension in its major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics and an important partner on its path toward Chinese modernization.

PARTNERS FOR COOPERATION

China-EU cooperation is ""complementary and mutually beneficial"" in essence, Xi said during a trilateral meeting in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

At the meeting held at Elysee Palace, Xi said that China-EU relations enjoy strong endogenous driving force and bright prospects of development, and this relationship does not target any third party, nor should it be dependent on or dictated by any third party.

The two sides have extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation in green and digital transition, Xi said, noting it is ""necessary"" for them to properly address economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultation, and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns.

""The EU is a pillar of the global economy and its members are some of China's largest trading partners,"" said Keith Bennett, an international relations consultant in London.

""Therefore, whether from the standpoint of bilateral economic and political relations, world peace and security, or major-country diplomacy, China-Europe relations are a key part of the global order,"" said Bennett.

Despite skepticism from some quarters in Europe about the benefits of trade and economic cooperation with China, empirical evidence highlights the fruitful results of China-EU economic and trade cooperation in the past decades.

Official data show that the EU stands as China's second-largest trading partner, ranking high in both imports and exports. Likewise, China is the EU's second-largest trading partner, primary source of imports, and third-largest export destination.

Meanwhile, Chinese and European enterprises continue to be upbeat about each other's markets, as statistics showed that the stock of two-way investment has exceeded 250 billion U.S. dollars.

""I believe that the economic cooperation between Europe and China is something very important. China is strong, and that is why Europe has to develop itself and be strong also,"" Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of the LVMH group, told Xinhua on Monday before the closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

When addressing the entrepreneurs at the closing ceremony, Xi urged the EU to join China to ""oppose attempts to turn business relations into political, ideological or security issues.""

""We should turn China and Europe into each other's key partners for business cooperation, priority partners for cooperation in science and technology, and trustworthy partners for cooperation in industrial and supply chains,"" Xi said.

NO SUCH THING AS ""CHINA'S OVERCAPACITY""

Xi's remarks came as Washington is maneuvering to rally its allies in the West to ""de-risk"" from China, and slow down the country's high-tech progress, alongside escalating protectionist rhetoric concerning the so-called ""Chinese overcapacity"" in clean energy sectors.

In the trilateral meeting with French and EU leaders, Xi rejected the claim of ""China's overcapacity"" from the perspective of comparative advantage and in light of global demand.

""China's new energy industry has made real progress in open competition and represents advanced production capacity. It not only increases global supply and alleviates the pressure of global inflation, but also contributes significantly to global climate response and green transition,"" Xi said.

Amid complaints from some Western politicians about China's electric vehicles disrupting ""global prices,"" even prominent U.S. media outlets like Bloomberg have noted that the primary concern for advanced economies revolves around the efficiency and competitiveness of Chinese electric carmakers. This encompasses factors such as their technological expertise and modern transportation infrastructure.

As to the ""overcapacity problem,"" studies have shown that the clean energy sector faces significant challenges in meeting global demand.

At the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.

In 2023, a year with a record-high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.

""On clean energy, China is a partner for us,"" Luc Remont, chairman and CEO of the French national electricity company EDF, told Xinhua before Monday's closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

""The Chinese clean energy industry is welcomed in Europe to expand its capacities within Europe as well to serve the European market. Simultaneously, European industries are actively investing in China to bolster capacities within the country,"" Remont said.",english.cctv.com,news,中央电视台,,0.2627450980392156,452852663,1,https://p2.img.cctvpic.com/photoworkspace/2024/05/08/2024050810241066575.jpg,eng-9539933

In 2023, for the first time, 30% of the world's electricity will be produced from renewable sources, thanks to the expansion of wind and solar energy. The milestone is even more significant in the European Union, where 44% of electricity was generated from renewable sources.

This is the conclusion of the fifth edition of the Global Electricity Review report, prepared by Ember and published today, Wednesday, May 8. Although the most striking thing about the study is the researchers' forecast, who trust that a ""new era"" of decrease in fossil energy generation is about to begin.

In the last two decades, renewable energies have gone from representing 19% of global electricity production (2000) to the current figure of 30% and, as the report concludes, has been the growth of wind and solar energy those that have driven the record.

""The future of renewable energy has arrived,"" said Dave Jones, director of Ember's Global Insights program, in a statement, adding: ""And solar energy, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible. "".

Also in the last two decades, solar and wind energy have grown significantly, going from 0.2% in 2000 to 12.4% last year. This expansion has been even faster in the European Union, which accounted for 17% of global growth in solar and wind energy generation in 2023.

Of these two energy sources, solar has established itself as the main provider of electricity growth worldwide and, for the second consecutive year, surpassed wind energy in the production of new electricity. Researchers have further noted that solar generated more than twice as much new electricity as coal in 2023, while maintaining its position as the world's fastest-growing source of electricity for the 19th consecutive year.

In terms of geographic distribution, China led in solar and wind generation, representing 51% and 60% respectively of new global generation. Greece ranked second in solar electricity generation, followed by Hungary and the Netherlands. And in the specific case of Spain, the country was the eighth country with the highest electricity generation with solar energy and the seventh with wind energy.

As a result of these changes, the group argues that the CO2 intensity of global energy generation reached a new historical low in 2023, being 12% lower than its peak in 2007. In addition, they maintain that the expansion of wind energy and Solar energy would have been enough to cause a decrease in the sector's emissions during 2023, if not for the reduction in hydroelectric power generation caused by the drought.

The report indicates that, under normal conditions, a 1.1% decrease in fossil energy generation and, therefore, in emissions would have been achieved. However, due to the drought-induced shortfall in hydropower, coal-fired electricity generation was increased to compensate, resulting in a 1% increase in global energy sector emissions.

To affirm this, they rely on the fact that almost all of the increase in coal generation last year (95%) occurred in four countries that were severely affected by droughts: China, India, Vietnam and Mexico.

However, despite the decline in hydropower, the report maintains that the rapid growth of solar and wind energy mentioned above - as well as the projected future growth for both renewable energy sources - ""have brought the world to a point ""crucial turning point where fossil energy generation begins to decline globally.""

Ember argues that clean electricity has helped slow the growth of fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last ten years, and that the data collected gives them ""confidence"" that a new era of decreasing carbon emissions is about to begin. electric sector.

Specifically, they project a 2% reduction in global fossil energy generation in 2024, which will lead to further reductions in subsequent years.

The researchers add that, as a result, half of the world's economies are at least five years beyond their fossil energy peak. In the specific case of the European Union, emissions from the electricity sector would have peaked in 2007 and would have decreased by 46% since then.

In this sense, the decrease in coal production that the European Union has made in the last ten years is considered important; which has been the second largest, behind the United States.

""The decrease in emissions from the energy sector is now inevitable. The year 2023 was probably the turning point, marking the peak of emissions in this sector and representing an important milestone in the history of energy,"" explains Jones, adding: ""But the pace of emissions decline depends on what as quickly as the renewable energy revolution continues.""

At COP28, world leaders agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, meaning that by that year, 60% of the world's electricity should come from renewable sources. This would reduce emissions from the electricity sector by almost half and would be aligned with the 1.5°C climate goal.

However, the report warns that to achieve these international climate change objectives, the energy sector should be the first to decarbonize; and that the decrease in emissions will be conditioned by the speed with which the expansion of clean energy continues.

To drive growth in renewables, the report highlights the importance of high-level policy ambition, incentive mechanisms and flexibility solutions, which are driving rapid growth in solar and wind energy in territories such as China, Brazil and the United States. Netherlands.

""We already know the key drivers helping countries unlock the full potential of solar and wind energy and there is an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future,"" explains Jones.

""The expansion of clean electricity not only helps decarbonize the energy sector, but also provides the boost needed to electrify the entire economy; and that is the real game changer for the climate,"" closes the expert.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.388235294117647,452849299,47,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_8ef64.png,eng-9547879

Overview of Financial and Operating Results: Revenue

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company's revenues increased to $90m, up from $71m last year, a growth rate of 27% year over year. The Company benefited from the revenue contribution of new operational projects, as well as higher production and inflation indexation embedded in our PPAs for already operational projects. This was offset by a decline in revenues driven by lower electricity prices in Spain relative to the prices observed in the same quarter in 2023.

Since the first quarter of 2023, 517 MW and 340 MWh of projects began selling electricity, including Apex Solar in the U.S.; ACDC in Hungary; Genesis Wind in Israel; and seven of the Solar & Storage cluster units in Israel. The Company also benefited from the ramp up of project Björnberget in Sweden which was partially operational in the first quarter of last year. These projects collectively generated $21m of revenue during the first quarter of 2024, with the biggest contributors being Björnberget $7m and Genesis Wind $9m.

More than 30 per cent of the world's energy is now generated using renewables and the European Union is well ahead of this global average, a new report has found.

Energy think tank Ember found that major growth in wind and solar helped push global electricity production past this milestone in 2023.

The report covers 80 countries which represent 92 per cent of the world's energy demand and historic data from 215 other countries. Its authors say that this rapid growth has brought the world to a crucial turning point where fossil fuel generation starts to decline.

Clean power sources have already helped to slow the growth in fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last 10 years.

""The renewables future has arrived,"" says Dave Jones, Ember's director of global insights. ""Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.""

Solar was the world's main supplier of electricity last year, providing twice as much new energy than coal. It maintained its status as the fastest-growing source of energy for the 19th year in a row.

The EU is well ahead of the global average generating 44 per cent of its energy from renewables. Expansion of solar and wind is happening much faster than the rest of the world with the bloc contributing 17 per cent of global growth in 2023.

Greece had the world's second-highest share of solar power in its energy mix at 19 per cent, according to the report, followed by Hungary (18 per cent) and the Netherlands (17 per cent). Chile was in first place, with almost 20 per cent.

Sarah Brown, Ember's European programme director, says the EU is ahead due to ""early adoption and early action"". The European Green Deal has been instrumental in setting targets, creating policies and securing investments, she adds.

""You've got obviously that early adoption, people are aiming for decarbonising the power sector and the best way to do that is through wind and solar,"" Brown explains.

""You also have the invasion of Ukraine which increased the sense of urgency around transitioning to clean power and getting off relying on fossil fuels - not just coal but also gas, and particularly from Russia. That was a big boost for accelerating the transition across the EU.""

Then in 2022, REPowerEU saw packages to boost implementation of wind and solar. Plans were put in place to help individual member states reach renewable energy targets and deploy technologies at a national scale.

There was a fall in energy demand due to the energy crisis, cost of living crisis and mild weather over the last few years. There was also a lot of talk about coal filling the gap when that demand rose again with increasing electrification.

But Brown says that towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year, demand has plateaued and stabilised.

""Certainly you can't ignore that there was some demand [based] impact on the decrease in use of fossil fuels, but also there was a significant role of wind and solar replacing it.""

Overall, she says, the EU is ""very much on the way"" to its goal of having renewable sources account for 72 per cent of power generation by 2030.

Globally, the Ember report says, renewable energy growth could have been even higher in 2023 if it weren't for a five-year low in generation from hydropower. This was due to drought in China and other parts of the world.

Normally this would have meant that the clean energy capacity added around the world last year would have caused fossil fuel generation to drop by 1.1 per cent. Instead, it was met with an increase in coal power, causing a 1 per cent increase in global power sector emissions.

Four countries severely affected by drought - China, India, Vietnam and Mexico - accounted for 95 per cent of the rise in coal generation.

Despite this, the report's authors say that expected clean energy growth gives them confidence that a new era of declining power sector emissions is about to begin. They predict a 2 per cent drop in fossil fuel generation this year with half the world's economies now at least five years past a peak in fossil power.

""The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable,"" Jones says.

""2023 was likely the pivot point - peak emissions in the power sector - a major turning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues.""

Key enablers like the EU with high-level policy ambition, incentive mechanisms and flexibility solutions need to continue to ""unleash the full potential of solar and wind"", he adds, for this momentum to continue.",euronews.com,news,Euronews English,,0.2784313725490195,452840595,4,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/42/06/94/1200x675_cmsv2_5d0e0012-287c-584b-99ba-a1f4186dfee4-8420694.jpg,eng-9547879

The two sides have extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation in green and digital transition, Xi said, noting it is ""necessary"" for them to properly address economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultation, and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns.

""The EU is a pillar of the global economy and its members are some of China's largest trading partners,"" said Keith Bennett, an international relations consultant in London.

""Therefore, whether from the standpoint of bilateral economic and political relations, world peace and security, or major-country diplomacy, China-Europe relations are a key part of the global order,"" said Bennett.

Despite skepticism from some quarters in Europe about the benefits of trade and economic cooperation with China, empirical evidence highlights the fruitful results of China-EU economic and trade cooperation in the past decades.

Official data show that the EU stands as China's second-largest trading partner, ranking high in both imports and exports. Likewise, China is the EU's second-largest trading partner, primary source of imports, and third-largest export destination.

Meanwhile, Chinese and European enterprises continue to be upbeat about each other's markets, as statistics showed that the stock of two-way investment has exceeded $250 billion.

""I believe that the economic cooperation between Europe and China is something very important. China is strong, and that is why Europe has to develop itself and be strong also,"" Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of the LVMH group, told Xinhua on Monday before the closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

When addressing the entrepreneurs at the closing ceremony, Xi urged the EU to join China to ""oppose attempts to turn business relations into political, ideological or security issues.""

""We should turn China and Europe into each other's key partners for business cooperation, priority partners for cooperation in science and technology, and trustworthy partners for cooperation in industrial and supply chains,"" Xi said.

No such thing as ""China's overcapacity""

Xi's remarks came as Washington is maneuvering to rally its allies in the West to ""de-risk"" from China, and slow down the country's high-tech progress, alongside escalating protectionist rhetoric concerning the so-called ""Chinese overcapacity"" in clean energy sectors.

In the trilateral meeting with French and EU leaders, Xi rejected the claim of ""China's overcapacity"" from the perspective of comparative advantage and in light of global demand.

""China's new energy industry has made real progress in open competition and represents advanced production capacity. It not only increases global supply and alleviates the pressure of global inflation, but also contributes significantly to global climate response and green transition,"" Xi said.

Amid complaints from some Western politicians about China's electric vehicles disrupting ""global prices,"" even prominent U.S. media outlets like Bloomberg have noted that the primary concern for advanced economies revolves around the efficiency and competitiveness of Chinese electric carmakers. This encompasses factors such as their technological expertise and modern transportation infrastructure.

As to the ""overcapacity problem,"" studies have shown that the clean energy sector faces significant challenges in meeting global demand.

At the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.

In 2023, a year with a record-high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.

""On clean energy, China is a partner for us,"" Luc Remont, chairman and CEO of the French national electricity company EDF, told Xinhua before Monday's closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

""The Chinese clean energy industry is welcomed in Europe to expand its capacities within Europe as well to serve the European market. Simultaneously, European industries are actively investing in China to bolster capacities within the country,"" Remont said.

Global challenges

Xi's trip is his first visit to Europe in nearly five years, and coincides with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France.

The two sides should stay committed to the spirit that guided the establishment of their diplomatic ties, namely, independence, mutual understanding, long-term vision and mutual benefit, and enrich it with new features of the new era, Xi said during talks with Macron at Elysee Palace.

Noting that history has proven time and again that at the end of the day, conflicts can only be resolved through negotiation, Xi said when he jointly met the press with Macron that China calls on all parties to resume engagement and dialogue to build mutual trust.

As the world goes through transformation and turbulence not seen in a century, China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a ""new Cold War"" or bloc confrontation, he said.

Xi pointed out that today's world is far from being tranquil. ""China and France, as permanent members of the UN Security Council, should speak out for peaceful settlement of hotspot issues and contribute to a world of lasting peace and common security. China will work with France to advocate, on the occasion of the Paris Olympic Games, a cessation of hostilities around the world during the Games,"" he said.

""The fact that France and China, who are both permanent members of the Security Council, can work together is very important, given the reality that the world is facing two conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza,"" said Pascal Boniface, founding director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

China and France have also long collaborated on combating climate change and environmental degradation, said Boniface, adding that he is glad to witness both sides' efforts to promote a more peaceful world and strengthen multilateralism, which is currently facing significant challenges.

The Chinese president said in a written speech upon arrival that he hopes China and France will light up their way forward with the torch of history, open a brighter future of China-France relations and make new contributions to world peace, stability and development.

""I hope this visit will help cement our long-standing friendship, enhance political trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields,"" he said, adding that it is a great pleasure to begin his third state visit to the French Republic at the invitation of Macron.

A typical EV battery pack can store around 40 kilowatt hours of energy, according to E.ON, and up to 100 kWh hours, depending on the model. So BMW and other automakers are working to harness these significant energy reserves to provide supplemental energy during times of peak demand.

The first stage of BMW's rollout will include bidirectional charging, allowing an EV battery to serve as a stationary energy storage device. The system integrates with BMW's Wallbox Professional Level-2 home charger and solar panels. The electricity generated by a home's solar panels can be temporarily stored in a BMW vehicle's battery pack, then fed back to a home's electrical system as needed.

For the second stage of the rollout, customers will be able to select a portion of their BMW's EV's battery's capacity to use for both charging from the grid and discharging electricity back to the grid during peak times. BMW says these functions will be available in select markets once the regulatory framework and other measures are adopted. E.ON will manage the charging process together with the BMW to enable revenue generation from the transfer of energy to and from a BMW EV and the grid.

The bidirectional technology also includes vehicle to load functionality, allowing an EV to power external devices like power tools, e-bikes and camping accessories.

""We are constantly improving our range of charging products and services in order to maximize the benefit to the customer,"" said Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW, responsible for development, in a press release.

According to the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, the integration of EVs with the grid will be essential for reducing emissions, as well as for maintaining reliable electricity, reducing costs and enabling a seamless charging experience.

Last month, General Motors announced the availability of its first vehicle-to-home EV charging products. The automaker's Ultium Home V2H Enablement Kit includes a power inverter, home hub and dark start battery for delivering 9.6 kilowatts of discharge power from a GM vehicle.

BMW's next-generation Neue Klasse EVs will be built on an all-new architecture and the first models are slated to enter series production at the automaker's Plant Debrecen in Hungary.

Speaking at a meeting of the Hungarian-Uzbek mixed economic committee, Péter Szijjártó said bilateral trade surpassed 100 million euros last year, and Hungarian companies were preparing to invest in Uzbekistan.

The two countries are also ready to triple their joint investment fund to 150 million dollars to ensure support for every project, Szijjártó said, according to a ministry statement.

Szijjártó said cooperation was expected to expand to the energy sector in the future. Uzbekistan's electricity demand is expected to double by 2030. ""Realistically, producing large quantities of cheap, sustainable, and safe energy is only possible through nuclear energy,"" he said, adding that Hungary was supporting Uzbekistan's nuclear program and that the training of Uzbek experts had already started there.

He said the two countries have also agreed that Uzbekistan would use Hungarian cooling technology should it sign a contract with Russia's Rosatom to construct a new nuclear plant.

Szijjártó said Hungary's friendly relations with Central Asia went back in 2010. Then, the country faced criticism from several Western countries ""who have since changed their tune as it turned out that the region is rich in rare earths, and that there is a need for new transport routes between East and West,"" Szijjártó said.

Later on Tuesday, Szijjártó met Laziz Kudratov, Uzbekistan's minister for investment, industry, and trade. In a joint statement, the ministers said bilateral trade has grown by 86 percent since 2010, surpassing 100 million US dollars last year. He said that a Hungarian pharmaceutical company is preparing to build a factory in Uzbekistan, and preparations are in the home run for a 165 million US dollar chicken processing plant. Further, OTP Bank's presence in the country offers Hungarian investors opportunities.

He added that

Tashkent has also pledged to set up a 50-hectare special investment zone for Hungarian companies.

He said direct flights between Budapest and Tashkent will resume on June 30. As we wrote before, Budapest flights to Uzbek capital resume, details HERE.

The minister said the scholarship program launched by Hungary is very popular in Uzbekistan. 170 students are accepted at universities in Hungary each year, and more than a thousand have already applied for this academic year, Szijjártó said.

Our news portal was invited to Tashkent International Investment Forum 2024. Read our coverage of the event here.

The economic performance of European countries is thoroughly affected by their collaboration with China, with Eastern investments and trade hugely significant from the point of competitiveness and growth, the foreign minister and trade said on Tuesday.

The ministry cited Szijjártó as saying in Tashkent that civilised East-West cooperation was increasingly important because galloping economic growth is currently occurring in the East rather than in the West.

He cited the example of China, noting that Chinese investments and bilateral trade ""have a major influence on European economies"".

""Countries able to preserve their achievements and develop fast are developing cooperation with the East most effectively and quickly,"" he added.

Szijjártó said that in the current era of wars and crises, trends are developing towards the formation of blocs worldwide.

""This goes against our national interests. Our goal is that the upcoming period should be dedicated to making connections and not forming blocs,"" he added.

""We have been developing cooperation with Central Asia for 14 years. We recognised its importance early on when it attracted serious criticism, but by now, we have proven to be right,"" he said.",dailynewshungary.com,news,Daily News Hungary,,0.419607843137255,452785033,13,https://contentf5.dailynewshungary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Uzbekistan-Hungary-cooperation.jpg,eng-9548752

Xi, who is on a six-day trip to France, Serbia and Hungary through Friday, said China regards Europe as an important dimension in its major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics and an important partner on its path toward Chinese modernization.

China-EU cooperation is ""complementary and mutually beneficial"" in essence, Xi said during a trilateral meeting in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

At the meeting held at Elysee Palace, Xi said that China-EU relations enjoy strong endogenous driving force and bright prospects of development, and this relationship does not target any third party, nor should it be dependent on or dictated by any third party.

The two sides have extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation in green and digital transition, Xi said, noting it is ""necessary"" for them to properly address economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultation, and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns.

""The EU is a pillar of the global economy and its members are some of China's largest trading partners,"" said Keith Bennett, an international relations consultant in London.

""Therefore, whether from the standpoint of bilateral economic and political relations, world peace and security, or major-country diplomacy, China-Europe relations are a key part of the global order,"" said Bennett.

Despite skepticism from some quarters in Europe about the benefits of trade and economic cooperation with China, empirical evidence highlights the fruitful results of China-EU economic and trade cooperation in the past decades.

Official data show that the EU stands as China's second-largest trading partner, ranking high in both imports and exports. Likewise, China is the EU's second-largest trading partner, primary source of imports, and third-largest export destination.

Meanwhile, Chinese and European enterprises continue to be upbeat about each other's markets, as statistics showed that the stock of two-way investment has exceeded 250 billion U.S. dollars.

""I believe that the economic cooperation between Europe and China is something very important. China is strong, and that is why Europe has to develop itself and be strong also,"" Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of the LVMH group, told Xinhua on Monday before the closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

When addressing the entrepreneurs at the closing ceremony, Xi urged the EU to join China to ""oppose attempts to turn business relations into political, ideological or security issues.""

""We should turn China and Europe into each other's key partners for business cooperation, priority partners for cooperation in science and technology, and trustworthy partners for cooperation in industrial and supply chains,"" Xi said.

Xi's remarks came as Washington is maneuvering to rally its allies in the West to ""de-risk"" from China, and slow down the country's high-tech progress, alongside escalating protectionist rhetoric concerning the so-called ""Chinese overcapacity"" in clean energy sectors.

In the trilateral meeting with French and EU leaders, Xi rejected the claim of ""China's overcapacity"" from the perspective of comparative advantage and in light of global demand.

""China's new energy industry has made real progress in open competition and represents advanced production capacity. It not only increases global supply and alleviates the pressure of global inflation, but also contributes significantly to global climate response and green transition,"" Xi said.

Amid complaints from some Western politicians about China's electric vehicles disrupting ""global prices,"" even prominent U.S. media outlets like Bloomberg have noted that the primary concern for advanced economies revolves around the efficiency and competitiveness of Chinese electric carmakers. This encompasses factors such as their technological expertise and modern transportation infrastructure.

As to the ""overcapacity problem,"" studies have shown that the clean energy sector faces significant challenges in meeting global demand.

At the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.

In 2023, a year with a record-high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.

""On clean energy, China is a partner for us,"" Luc Remont, chairman and CEO of the French national electricity company EDF, told Xinhua before Monday's closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

""The Chinese clean energy industry is welcomed in Europe to expand its capacities within Europe as well to serve the European market. Simultaneously, European industries are actively investing in China to bolster capacities within the country,"" Remont said.

Xi's trip is his first visit to Europe in nearly five years, and coincides with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France.

The two sides should stay committed to the spirit that guided the establishment of their diplomatic ties, namely, independence, mutual understanding, long-term vision and mutual benefit, and enrich it with new features of the new era, Xi said during talks with Macron at Elysee Palace.

Noting that history has proven time and again that at the end of the day, conflicts can only be resolved through negotiation, Xi said when he jointly met the press with Macron that China calls on all parties to resume engagement and dialogue to build mutual trust.

As the world goes through transformation and turbulence not seen in a century, China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a ""new Cold War"" or bloc confrontation, he said.

Xi pointed out that today's world is far from being tranquil. ""China and France, as permanent members of the UN Security Council, should speak out for peaceful settlement of hotspot issues and contribute to a world of lasting peace and common security. China will work with France to advocate, on the occasion of the Paris Olympic Games, a cessation of hostilities around the world during the Games,"" he said.

""The fact that France and China, who are both permanent members of the Security Council, can work together is very important, given the reality that the world is facing two conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza,"" said Pascal Boniface, founding director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

China and France have also long collaborated on combating climate change and environmental degradation, said Boniface, adding that he is glad to witness both sides' efforts to promote a more peaceful world and strengthen multilateralism, which is currently facing significant challenges.

The Chinese president said in a written speech upon arrival that he hopes China and France will light up their way forward with the torch of history, open a brighter future of China-France relations and make new contributions to world peace, stability and development.

""I hope this visit will help cement our long-standing friendship, enhance political trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields,"" he said, adding that it is a great pleasure to begin his third state visit to the French Republic at the invitation of Macron.

There was no power supply to 5,400 clients in around 90 populated localities in the Sumy region, 1,600 clients in 30 populated localities in the Chernigov region, and 3,800 clients in 52 populated localities in the Kiev-controlled part of the Zaporozhye region, the statement said.

About 102,000 households had no power supply in the Kharkov region, consistent with schedules, on Tuesday, same as on Monday.

Additionally, a thunderstorm and high winds cut power supply to 53 populated localities in the Zhitomir, Sumy and Chernigov regions on Tuesday morning, Ukrenergo said. Some 1,000 clients in seven populated localities, 600 clients in five populated localities, and 4,300 clients in 42 populated localities have no power supply in those regions, respectively. Power supply disrupted by bad weather has resumed to over 10,000 clients in the Kiev region.

Thus, there is no power supply to 472 populated localities across Ukraine.

Laszlo Kemencei lives as sustainably as possible on his small farm in eastern Hungary. He believes the land is effectively borrowed from his young daughter, so he must do all he can to preserve it for the future.

Kemencei, 28, wife Cintia and Boroka, almost two, moved to the farm outside Ladanybene three years ago. They keep horses, pigs and chickens on an area of 4.5 hectares, which they partly lease for grazing.

They do not use pesticides, keep their animals free range, and dig the land as little as possible to preserve the structure and moisture of the rich soil. They grow their own vegetables and slaughter or barter the meat they need, while trading the rest with families who choose a similar lifestyle.

Kemencei says while becoming fully self-sufficient seems an unrealistic goal, they rely minimally on external resources.

""This land, we have not inherited from our fathers, but we have it on a lease from our children ... so we try to live and farm the land in a sustainable way,"" he says, sitting in their cosy kitchen where a chunk of pork sizzles in the oven.

While there are no statistics on how many families are following a similar lifestyle in Hungary - part of their choice is not necessarily to engage with central institutions - anecdotal evidence suggests it is a growing trend.

Some want to rein in the costs of living, while for others it is to escape a consumer-driven society or live a more environmentally friendly life.

Kemencei estimates there are around 1,000 families trying to embrace some form of sustainability, either alone or as part of informal barter arrangements, or as part of more structured eco-villages.

He said a loose grouping called Sustainable Regression had around 600 to 800 members - although not all have committed to all aspects of sustainable living.

Reuters spoke to six other families, many of whom had left jobs in the formal economy, who were now growing much of their own food. Some had their own energy and water supplies.

Akos Varga and wife Gabi, both in their late 50s, sold their IT and solar panel business four years ago to live a freer life on a farm in Nagybereny, in western Hungary.

Varga believes small, self-sustaining communities where mutual trust matters will spread.

""We thought we had achieved what we wanted and asked ourselves if this is really happiness. And we could not say yes to that,"" Varga said. ""We were seeking being close to nature.""

BARTER TRADE

For Kemencei, the trusted networks matter too. A small pot-bellied pig traded with a friend is eaten from nose to tail. A rooster is swapped with another friend who is a beekeeper.

""We sometimes slaughter chickens for barter trade ... but only from a place where we know the farming is similar to ours,"" Kemencei said.

""We don't want to change the world here ... or become some kind of superheroes, there are plenty of those out there, we would like to produce most of what we need.""

Currently, they do not live off-grid. They have the internet, and buy electricity and gas for heating. But their water comes from a well and they hope to install solar panels and a wind turbine when they can afford it, Kemencei said.

They can get by on about 250,000 forints ($680) per month, outside of emergencies. They buy milk, sugar and other basics that they cannot grow themselves.

The family have a walipini greenhouse for plants - a hole in the ground covered with polyethylene glazing. The name means ""place of warmth"" in the language in Bolivia where the practice comes from.

""We should reduce our wants just a little, as now we live in a world where we sit on a galloping horse and when the horse dies, we just jump on another one,"" he says.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)

PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday underscored the importance of bolstering cooperative ties between China and France as well as the European Union (EU), particularly amid escalating protectionism and raging conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

Xi, who is on a six-day trip to France, Serbia and Hungary through Friday, said China-EU cooperation is ""complementary and mutually beneficial"" in essence during a trilateral meeting here with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The two sides have extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation in green and digital transition, Xi said, noting it is ""necessary"" for them to properly address economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultation, and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns.

""The EU is a pillar of the global economy and its members are some of China's largest trading partners,"" said Keith Bennett, an international relations consultant in London.

""Therefore, whether from the standpoint of bilateral economic and political relations, world peace and security, or major-country diplomacy, China-Europe relations are a key part of the global order,"" said Bennett.

Despite skepticism from some quarters in Europe about the benefits of trade and economic cooperation with China, empirical evidence highlights the fruitful results of China-EU economic and trade cooperation in the past decades.

Official data show that the EU stands as China's second-largest trading partner, ranking high in both imports and exports. Likewise, China is the EU's second-largest trading partner, primary source of imports, and third-largest export destination.

Meanwhile, Chinese and European enterprises continue to be upbeat about each other's markets, as statistics showed that the stock of two-way investment has exceeded 250 billion U.S. dollars.

""I believe that the economic cooperation between Europe and China is something very important. China is strong, and that is why Europe has to develop itself and be strong also,"" Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of the LVMH group, told Xinhua on Monday before the closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

When addressing the entrepreneurs at the closing ceremony, Xi urged the EU to join China to ""oppose attempts to turn business relations into political, ideological or security issues.""

""We should turn China and Europe into each other's key partners for business cooperation, priority partners for cooperation in science and technology, and trustworthy partners for cooperation in industrial and supply chains,"" Xi said.

His remarks came as Washington is maneuvering to rally its allies in the West to ""de-risk"" from China, and slow down the country's high-tech progress, alongside escalating protectionist rhetoric concerning the so-called ""Chinese overcapacity"" in clean energy sectors.

In the trilateral meeting with French and EU leaders, Xi rejected the claim of ""China's overcapacity"" from the perspective of comparative advantage and in light of global demand.

""China's new energy industry has made real progress in open competition and represents advanced production capacity. It not only increases global supply and alleviates the pressure of global inflation, but also contributes significantly to global climate response and green transition,"" Xi said.

Amid complaints from some Western politicians about China's electric vehicles disrupting ""global prices,"" even prominent U.S. media outlets like Bloomberg have noted that the primary concern for advanced economies revolves around the efficiency and competitiveness of Chinese electric carmakers. This encompasses factors such as their technological expertise and modern transportation infrastructure.

As to the ""overcapacity problem,"" studies have shown that the clean energy sector faces significant challenges in meeting global demand.

At the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.

In 2023, a year with a record-high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.

""On clean energy, China is a partner for us,"" Luc Remont, chairman and CEO of the French national electricity company EDF, told Xinhua before Monday's closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

""The Chinese clean energy industry is welcomed in Europe to expand its capacities within Europe as well to serve the European market. Simultaneously, European industries are actively investing in China to bolster capacities within the country,"" he said.

Xi's trip is his first visit to Europe in nearly five years, and coincides with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France.

The two sides should stay committed to the spirit that guided the establishment of their diplomatic ties, namely, independence, mutual understanding, long-term vision and mutual benefit, and enrich it with new features of the new era, Xi said during talks with Macron at Elysee Palace.

As the world goes through transformation and turbulence not seen in a century, China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a ""new Cold War"" or bloc confrontation, Xi said.

""The fact that France and China, who are both permanent members of the Security Council, can work together is very important, given the reality that the world is facing two conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza,"" said Pascal Boniface, founding director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

China and France have also long collaborated on combating climate change and environmental degradation, said Boniface, adding that he is glad to witness both sides' efforts to promote a more peaceful world and strengthen multilateralism, which is currently facing significant challenges.",bbrtv.com,news,bbrtv.com,,0.1137254901960785,452774342,1,,

János Lázár, Minister of Construction and Transport, held a press conference at the industrial park in Makó (southern Hungary, near Szeged) on Monday, where he stressed that the development of the Southern Great Plain region is a priority for the government.

The Ministry of Construction and Transport is working on two priority projects in Csongrád county: the extension of the drinking water and wastewater network of the Makó industrial park and the infrastructure development related to BYD's investment in Szeged. The infrastructure development of several hundred billion forints needed for the automotive investment in Szeged will be implemented entirely by the ministry. This includes the connection of the new car plant to the M5 motorway, the construction of a new terminal and rail link to the Szeged-Budapest line, and the construction of the necessary drinking water and wastewater capacity, the minister said.

János Lázár stressed, adding that Makó is one of them. This is guaranteed by the M43 motorway and the fact that the government is planning to renovate the railway line connecting the city with Szeged, and is also considering the construction of a new suburban railway, a tram-train, the minister noted.

The technical hand-over is scheduled for October, the trial operation will start this year and the plant will be operating at full capacity next year, the minister underlined.

China is the biggest investor in Hungary today, he noted. In addition to the Chinese industrial investments in the county, the politician highlighted the construction of the Budapest-Belgrade railway line. This is a ""pilot project"" for China in Europe, because it is the first time that Chinese safety and control technology is being used on the European Union's rail network, he said.

the politician said. In connection with the development of Benepack Hungary Kft. in the industrial park, the development of the drinking water and sewage network was launched recently with a budget of around HUF 3 billion (EUR 7.7 million). In addition, the natural gas and electricity capacities supplying the area will be expanded, the minister added.

Mayor Éva Erzsébet Farkas noted at the event that Benepack Hungary Kft. will produce aluminum cans at its new plant. The investor chose Makó because it wants to serve its beer and soft drink production partners in the neighboring countries, mainly Romania and Serbia. Last May, the municipality decided to allocate 10.1 hectares of land in the industrial park for the construction of the plant. Construction of the 25,000 square meter production hall and associated service facilities started in February.",hungarytoday.hu,news,Hungary Today,,0.003921568627450966,452772993,13,https://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/438119503_1436864743874833_8921256867996353046_n.jpg,

Xi, who is on a six-day trip to France, Serbia and Hungary through Friday, said China-EU cooperation is ""complementary and mutually beneficial"" in essence during a trilateral meeting here with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The two sides have extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation in green and digital transition, Xi said, noting it is ""necessary"" for them to properly address economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultation, and accommodate each other's legitimate concerns.

""The EU is a pillar of the global economy and its members are some of China's largest trading partners,"" said Keith Bennett, an international relations consultant in London.

""Therefore, whether from the standpoint of bilateral economic and political relations, world peace and security, or major-country diplomacy, China-Europe relations are a key part of the global order,"" said Bennett.

Despite skepticism from some quarters in Europe about the benefits of trade and economic cooperation with China, empirical evidence highlights the fruitful results of China-EU economic and trade cooperation in the past decades.

Official data show that the EU stands as China's second-largest trading partner, ranking high in both imports and exports. Likewise, China is the EU's second-largest trading partner, primary source of imports, and third-largest export destination.

Meanwhile, Chinese and European enterprises continue to be upbeat about each other's markets, as statistics showed that the stock of two-way investment has exceeded 250 billion U.S. dollars.

""I believe that the economic cooperation between Europe and China is something very important. China is strong, and that is why Europe has to develop itself and be strong also,"" Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of the LVMH group, told Xinhua on Monday before the closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

When addressing the entrepreneurs at the closing ceremony, Xi urged the EU to join China to ""oppose attempts to turn business relations into political, ideological or security issues.""

""We should turn China and Europe into each other's key partners for business cooperation, priority partners for cooperation in science and technology, and trustworthy partners for cooperation in industrial and supply chains,"" Xi said.

His remarks came as Washington is maneuvering to rally its allies in the West to ""de-risk"" from China, and slow down the country's high-tech progress, alongside escalating protectionist rhetoric concerning the so-called ""Chinese overcapacity"" in clean energy sectors.

In the trilateral meeting with French and EU leaders, Xi rejected the claim of ""China's overcapacity"" from the perspective of comparative advantage and in light of global demand.

""China's new energy industry has made real progress in open competition and represents advanced production capacity. It not only increases global supply and alleviates the pressure of global inflation, but also contributes significantly to global climate response and green transition,"" Xi said.

Amid complaints from some Western politicians about China's electric vehicles disrupting ""global prices,"" even prominent U.S. media outlets like Bloomberg have noted that the primary concern for advanced economies revolves around the efficiency and competitiveness of Chinese electric carmakers. This encompasses factors such as their technological expertise and modern transportation infrastructure.

As to the ""overcapacity problem,"" studies have shown that the clean energy sector faces significant challenges in meeting global demand.

At the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris Agreement targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.

In 2023, a year with a record-high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.

""On clean energy, China is a partner for us,"" Luc Remont, chairman and CEO of the French national electricity company EDF, told Xinhua before Monday's closing ceremony of the Sixth Meeting of the China-France Business Council.

""The Chinese clean energy industry is welcomed in Europe to expand its capacities within Europe as well to serve the European market. Simultaneously, European industries are actively investing in China to bolster capacities within the country,"" he said.

Xi's trip is his first visit to Europe in nearly five years, and coincides with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France.

The two sides should stay committed to the spirit that guided the establishment of their diplomatic ties, namely, independence, mutual understanding, long-term vision and mutual benefit, and enrich it with new features of the new era, Xi said during talks with Macron at Elysee Palace.

As the world goes through transformation and turbulence not seen in a century, China and France should uphold independence and jointly prevent a ""new Cold War"" or bloc confrontation, Xi said.

RenewablesNow discussed the topic with Simen Bomnes Valamo, Director Market Intelligence at Kyoto Group on the sidelines of the recently held Energy Tech Summit 2024 in Bilbao, Spain.

Kyoto Group AS is a Norwegian company that develops solutions to capture and manage energy from renewable energy sources and apply it to reduce the carbon footprint for industrial process heat. Its proprietary development is Heatcube, a thermal energy storage solution that uses electricity from surplus solar or wind generation and molten salt to produce heat in the form of steam. The product is offered to industrial customers, providing them with technology to lower both their costs and CO2 emissions for producing process heat using renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Heatcube, which can be configured with storage capacities from 16 MWh to over 120 MWh, is being installed commercially in Hungary.

Q: As it appears that a considerable portion of industrial energy demand is driven by the need for heat, not electricity, do you think thermal energy storage is the missing piece in the puzzle to link renewable energy production and industrial processes on a larger scale?

Correct. Heat is the dominating part of the industrial energy demand. The industry will need to decarbonise this heat demand and to do so, they will need a viable and affordable solution to fuel switch with and Thermal Energy Storage is the most prominent solution to do so. Thermal Energy Storage systems like Heatcube connect the varying renewable energy production with the stable energy demand in the industry - it enables electrification of the industrial heat demand with the lowest possible cost while at the same time solving the flexibility challenges in the power system.

Q: How do you see the product's future role in the decarbonisation of industrial processes?

Half of the global primary energy consumption is in the form of heat. Almost all this heat is produced by combustion of fossil fuels, making up 40% of the global CO2 emissions. In other words, decarbonisation of heat production is key to reaching any emission reduction targets. The lowest-cost solution for decarbonisation of industrial heat production is electrification with renewable power. However, the industry needs a stable and continuous heat supply while renewables produce energy only when the sun shines and the wind blows. This is exactly what Kyoto Group solves with our Thermal Energy Storage solution - Heatcube. Heatcube sources renewable electricity whenever it is available, either off-grid or through the power market, stores the energy in the form of heat and discharges this heat for use in industrial processes whenever the industry needs it.

Q: The solution bets on using the abundance of renewable energy in off-peak hours. How does it increase the value of grid stabilisation and promote grid balancing?

One of the biggest challenges with the future power system is the increasing need for flexibility that arises from intermittent renewables. Historically, the primary source of flexibility in the power system has been fossil-based power production that is now being replaced with intermittent production. As Heatcube can provide heat 24/7 while using electricity only 4-10 hours of the day, it provides new flexibility to the system and creates value for the grid in two ways. First, it enables load shifting from the hours with high grid load and low power supply to the hours of the day when there is abundance of power production, matching the electricity consumption with the electricity production. Secondly, Heatcube is highly responsive and with the flexibility in storage it can offer ancillary services for the grid operators on a continuous basis. The ability to offer balancing services to the grid benefits not only the grid operators but also the industrial customers who are being remunerated for the service.

Q: What is your opinion about the integration of AI-driven technologies, do you think they could contribute to overcoming the challenges in improving grid flexibility and resilience? Are you using AI-based technologies for that and what are Kyoto Group's endeavours in that direction?

In the transition towards a more distributed energy system, it follows a necessary integration of smart technologies to fully enable the system flexibility potential and we believe that AI-based solutions will play a central role in this. The power system requirement is reflected in the power markets that are moving towards more flexible products. This is why we have developed an AI-based platform for the operation of Heatcube, ensuring full utilisation of the opportunities in the current power market structure and preparing for future energy market changes.

In Kyoto Group we see AI as an integral part of the future energy system, and we have based our product development on AI technologies. Our commercial Heatcube installation in northern Denmark is the world's first AI-powered Thermal Energy Storage asset with fully digitalised operation and energy trading. With an AI-based platform for the operation of Heatcube we can optimise performance and minimise operational costs, while also enabling easy integration of AI-based energy trading systems.

Q: Last year, Kyoto Group received an order to install Heatcube commercially in Hungary to reduce natural gas supply for a client? How do you estimate the technology's potential on a large-scale industrial basis?

Yes, we are installing a Heatcube in Hungary to reduce the natural gas use for KALL Ingredients, a corn processing company using steam to produce sugar products, where Heatcube will reduce their annual CO2 emissions by up to 8,000 tonnes. This is the second commercial installation of Heatcube and we have announced several additional projects that are in the final stage of development. This demonstrates the attractiveness and profitability of Heatcube in the market today and we are continuously maturing the pipeline of projects to be realised in the coming years. The market for green industrial heat is immense, with our Heatcube we target industrial heat in the temperature range 135-400 degrees Celsius which represents a serviceable market of more than 11,000 TWh/year. This is equal to 370,000 Heatcubes installed.",renewablesnow.com,news,Renewablesnow.com,Veselina Petrova,0.4666666666666666,452768620,23,https://cdn.aiidatapro.net/media/ce/de/a0/t780x490/cedea0365cc69fd125dc2d5cdfc3aeee.jpg,

Not long afterward, street protests calling for free speech, due process, accountability, and democracy brought about the end of the Communist regimes in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Within a few years, the Soviet Union itself would no longer exist.

Also on June 4, 1989, the Chinese Communist Party ordered the military to remove thousands of students from Tiananmen Square. The students were calling for free speech, due process, accountability, and democracy. Soldiers arrested and killed demonstrators in Beijing and around the country. Later, they systematically tracked down the leaders of the protest movement and forced them to confess and recant. Some spent years in jail. Others managed to elude their pursuers and flee the country forever.

In the aftermath of these events, the Chinese concluded that the physical elimination of dissenters was insufficient. To prevent the democratic wave then sweeping across Central Europe from reaching East Asia, the Chinese Communist Party eventually set out to eliminate not just the people but the ideas that had motivated the protests. In the years to come, this would require policing what the Chinese people could see online.

Nobody believed that this would work. In 2000, President Bill Clinton told an audience at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies that it was impossible. ""In the knowledge economy,"" he said, ""economic innovation and political empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand in hand."" The transcript records the audience reactions:

While we were still rhapsodizing about the many ways in which the internet could spread democracy, the Chinese were designing what's become known as the Great Firewall of China. That method of internet management -- which is in effect conversation management -- contains many different elements, beginning with an elaborate system of blocks and filters that prevent internet users from seeing particular words and phrases. Among them, famously, are Tiananmen, 1989, and June 4, but there are many more. In 2000, a directive called ""Measures for Managing Internet Information Services"" prohibited an extraordinarily wide range of content, including anything that ""endangers national security, divulges state secrets, subverts the government, undermines national unification,"" and ""is detrimental to the honor and interests of the state"" -- anything, in other words, that the authorities didn't like.

From the May 2022 issue: There is no liberal world order

The Chinese regime also combined online tracking methods with other tools of repression, including security cameras, police inspections, and arrests. In Xinjiang province, where China's Uyghur Muslim population is concentrated, the state has forced people to install ""nanny apps"" that can scan phones for forbidden phrases and pick up unusual behavior: Anyone who downloads a virtual private network, anyone who stays offline altogether, and anyone whose home uses too much electricity (which could be evidence of a secret houseguest) can arouse suspicion. Voice-recognition technology and even DNA swabs are used to monitor where Uyghurs walk, drive, and shop. With every new breakthrough, with every AI advance, China has gotten closer to its holy grail: a system that can eliminate not just the words democracy and Tiananmen from the internet, but the thinking that leads people to become democracy activists or attend public protests in real life.

But along the way, the Chinese regime discovered a deeper problem: Surveillance, regardless of sophistication, provides no guarantees. During the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese government imposed controls more severe than most of its citizens had ever experienced. Millions of people were locked into their homes. Untold numbers entered government quarantine camps. Yet the lockdown also produced the angriest and most energetic Chinese protests in many years. Young people who had never attended a demonstration and had no memory of Tiananmen gathered in the streets of Beijing and Shanghai in the autumn of 2022 to talk about freedom. In Xinjiang, where lockdowns were the longest and harshest, and where repression is most complete, people came out in public and sang the Chinese national anthem, emphasizing one line: ""Rise up, those who refuse to be slaves!"" Clips of their performance circulated widely, presumably because the spyware and filters didn't identify the national anthem as dissent.

Even in a state where surveillance is almost total, the experience of tyranny and injustice can radicalize people. Anger at arbitrary power will always lead someone to start thinking about another system, a better way to run society. The strength of these demonstrations, and the broader anger they reflected, was enough to spook the Chinese Communist Party into lifting the quarantine and allowing the virus to spread. The deaths that resulted were preferable to public anger and protest.

Like the demonstrations against President Vladimir Putin in Russia that began in 2011, the 2014 street protests in Venezuela, and the 2019 Hong Kong protests, the 2022 protests in China help explain something else: why autocratic regimes have slowly turned their repressive mechanisms outward, into the democratic world. If people are naturally drawn to the image of human rights, to the language of democracy, to the dream of freedom, then those concepts have to be poisoned. That requires more than surveillance, more than close observation of the population, more than a political system that defends against liberal ideas. It also requires an offensive plan: a narrative that damages both the idea of democracy everywhere in the world and the tools to deliver it.

On February 24, 2022, as Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, fantastical tales of biological warfare began surging across the internet. Russian officials solemnly declared that secret U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine had been conducting experiments with bat viruses and claimed that U.S. officials had confessed to manipulating ""dangerous pathogens."" The story was unfounded, not to say ridiculous, and was repeatedly debunked.

Nevertheless, an American Twitter account with links to the QAnon conspiracy network -- @WarClandestine -- began tweeting about the nonexistent biolabs, racking up thousands of retweets and views. The hashtag #biolab started trending on Twitter and reached more than 9 million views. Even after the account -- later revealed to belong to a veteran of the Army National Guard -- was suspended, people continued to post screenshots. A version of the story appeared on the Infowars website created by Alex Jones, best known for promoting conspiracy theories about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and harassing families of the victims. Tucker Carlson, then still hosting a show on Fox News, played clips of a Russian general and a Chinese spokesperson repeating the biolab fantasy and demanded that the Biden administration ""stop lying and [tell] us what's going on here.""

Chinese state media also leaned hard into the story. A foreign-ministry spokesperson declared that the U.S. controlled 26 biolabs in Ukraine: ""Russia has found during its military operations that the U.S. uses these facilities to conduct bio-military plans."" Xinhua, a Chinese state news agency, ran multiple headlines: ""U.S.-Led Biolabs Pose Potential Threats to People of Ukraine and Beyond,"" ""Russia Urges U.S. to Explain Purpose of Biological Labs in Ukraine,"" and so on. U.S. diplomats publicly refuted these fabrications. Nevertheless, the Chinese continued to spread them. So did the scores of Asian, African, and Latin American media outlets that have content-sharing agreements with Chinese state media. So did Telesur, the Venezuelan network; Press TV, the Iranian network; and Russia Today, in Spanish and Arabic, as well as on many Russia Today-linked websites around the world.

This joint propaganda effort worked. Globally, it helped undermine the U.S.-led effort to create solidarity with Ukraine and enforce sanctions against Russia. Inside the U.S., it helped undermine the Biden administration's effort to consolidate American public opinion in support of providing aid to Ukraine. According to one poll, a quarter of Americans believed the biolabs conspiracy theory to be true. After the invasion, Russia and China -- with, again, help from Venezuela, Iran, and far-right Europeans and Americans -- successfully created an international echo chamber. Anyone inside this echo chamber heard the biolab conspiracy theory many times, from different sources, each one repeating and building on the others to create the impression of veracity. They also heard false descriptions of Ukrainians as Nazis, along with claims that Ukraine is a puppet state run by the CIA, and that NATO started the war.

Outside this echo chamber, few even know it exists. At a dinner in Munich in February 2023, I found myself seated across from a European diplomat who had just returned from Africa. He had met with some students there and had been shocked to discover how little they knew about the war in Ukraine, and how much of what they did know was wrong. They had repeated the Russian claims that the Ukrainians are Nazis, blamed NATO for the invasion, and generally used the same kind of language that can be heard every night on the Russian evening news. The diplomat was mystified. He grasped for explanations: Maybe the legacy of colonialism explained the spread of these conspiracy theories, or Western neglect of the global South, or the long shadow of the Cold War.

But the story of how Africans -- as well as Latin Americans, Asians, and indeed many Europeans and Americans -- have come to spout Russian propaganda about Ukraine is not primarily a story of European colonial history, Western policy, or the Cold War. Rather, it involves China's systematic efforts to buy or influence both popular and elite audiences around the world; carefully curated Russian propaganda campaigns, some open, some clandestine, some amplified by the American and European far right; and other autocracies using their own networks to promote the same language.

To be fair to the European diplomat, the convergence of what had been disparate authoritarian influence projects is still new. Russian information-laundering and Chinese propaganda have long had different goals. Chinese propagandists mostly stayed out of the democratic world's politics, except to promote Chinese achievements, Chinese economic success, and Chinese narratives about Tibet or Hong Kong. Their efforts in Africa and Latin America tended to feature dull, unwatchable announcements of investments and state visits. Russian efforts were more aggressive -- sometimes in conjunction with the far right or the far left in the democratic world -- and aimed to distort debates and elections in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and elsewhere. Still, they often seemed unfocused, as if computer hackers were throwing spaghetti at the wall, just to see which crazy story might stick. Venezuela and Iran were fringe players, not real sources of influence.

Slowly, though, these autocracies have come together, not around particular stories, but around a set of ideas, or rather in opposition to a set of ideas. Transparency, for example. And rule of law. And democracy. They have heard language about those ideas -- which originate in the democratic world -- coming from their own dissidents, and have concluded that they are dangerous to their regimes. Their own rhetoric makes this clear. In 2013, as Chinese President Xi Jinping was beginning his rise to power, an internal Chinese memo, known enigmatically as Document No. 9 -- or, more formally, as the Communiqué on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere -- listed ""seven perils"" faced by the Chinese Communist Party. ""Western constitutional democracy"" led the list, followed by ""universal human rights,"" ""media independence,"" ""judicial independence,"" and ""civic participation."" The document concluded that ""Western forces hostile to China,"" together with dissidents inside the country, ""are still constantly infiltrating the ideological sphere,"" and instructed party leaders to push back against these ideas wherever they found them, especially online, inside China and around the world.

From the December 2021 issue: The bad guys are winning

Since at least 2004, the Russians have been focused on the same convergence of internal and external ideological threats. That was the year Ukrainians staged a popular revolt, known as the Orange Revolution -- the name came from the orange T-shirts and flags of the protesters -- against a clumsy attempt to steal a presidential election. The angry intervention of the Ukrainian public into what was meant to have been a carefully orchestrated victory for Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian candidate directly supported by Putin himself, profoundly unnerved the Russians. This was especially the case because a similarly unruly protest movement in Georgia had brought a pro-European politician, Mikheil Saakashvili, to power the year before.

Shaken by those two events, Putin put the bogeyman of ""color revolution"" at the center of Russian propaganda. Civic protest movements are now always described as color revolutions in Russia, and as the work of outsiders. Popular opposition leaders are always said to be puppets of foreign governments. Anti-corruption and prodemocracy slogans are linked to chaos and instability wherever they are used, whether in Tunisia, Syria, or the United States. In 2011, a year of mass protest against a manipulated election in Russia itself, Putin bitterly described the Orange Revolution as a ""well-tested scheme for destabilizing society,"" and he accused the Russian opposition of ""transferring this practice to Russian soil,"" where he feared a similar popular uprising intended to remove him from power.

Putin was wrong -- no ""scheme"" had been ""transferred."" Public discontent in Russia simply had no way to express itself except through street protest, and Putin's opponents had no legal means to remove him from power. Like so many other people around the world, they talked about democracy and human rights because they recognized that these concepts represented their best hope for achieving justice, and freedom from autocratic power. The protests that led to democratic transitions in the Philippines, Taiwan, South Africa, South Korea, and Mexico; the ""people's revolutions"" that washed across Central and Eastern Europe in 1989; the Arab Spring in 2011; and, yes, the color revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia -- all were begun by those who had suffered injustice at the hands of the state, and who seized on the language of freedom and democracy to propose an alternative.

This is the core problem for autocracies: The Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and others all know that the language of transparency, accountability, justice, and democracy appeals to some of their citizens, as it does to many people who live in dictatorships. Even the most sophisticated surveillance can't wholly suppress it. The very ideas of democracy and freedom must be discredited -- especially in the places where they have historically flourished.

In the 20th century, Communist Party propaganda was overwhelming and inspiring, or at least it was meant to be. The future it portrayed was shiny and idealized, a vision of clean factories, abundant produce, and healthy tractor drivers with large muscles and square jaws. The architecture was designed to overpower, the music to intimidate, the public spectacles to awe. In theory, citizens were meant to feel enthusiasm, inspiration, and hope. In practice, this kind of propaganda backfired, because people could compare what they saw on posters and in movies with a far more impoverished reality.

A few autocracies still portray themselves to their citizens as model states. The North Koreans continue to hold colossal military parades with elaborate gymnastics displays and huge portraits of their leader, very much in the Stalinist style. But most modern authoritarians have learned from the mistakes of the previous century. Freedom House, a nonprofit that advocates for democracy around the world, lists 56 countries as ""not free."" Most don't offer their fellow citizens a vision of utopia, and don't inspire them to build a better world. Instead, they teach people to be cynical and passive, apathetic and afraid, because there is no better world to build. Their goal is to persuade their own people to stay out of politics, and above all to convince them that there is no democratic alternative: Our state may be corrupt, but everyone else is corrupt too. You may not like our leader, but the others are worse. You may not like our society, but at least we are strong. The democratic world is weak, degenerate, divided, dying.

Instead of portraying China as the perfect society, modern Chinese propaganda seeks to inculcate nationalist pride, based on China's real experience of economic development, and to promote a Beijing model of progress through dictatorship and ""order"" that's superior to the chaos and violence of democracy. Chinese media mocked the laxity of the American response to the pandemic with an animated film that ended with the Statue of Liberty on an intravenous drip. China's Global Times wrote that Chinese people were mocking the January 6 insurrection as ""karma"" and ""retribution"": ""Seeing such scenarios,"" the publication's then-editor wrote in an op-ed, ""many Chinese will naturally recall that Nancy Pelosi once praised the violence of Hong Kong protesters as 'a beautiful sight to behold.' "" (Pelosi, of course, had praised peaceful demonstrators, not violence.) The Chinese are told that these forces of chaos are out to disrupt their own lives, and they are encouraged to fight against them in a ""people's war"" against foreign influence.

Russians, although they hear very little about what happens in their own towns and cities, receive similar messages about the decline of places they don't know and have mostly never visited: America, France, Britain, Sweden, Poland -- countries apparently filled with degeneracy, hypocrisy, and Russophobia. A study of Russian television from 2014 to 2017 found that negative news about Europe appeared on the three main Russian channels, all state-controlled, an average of 18 times a day. Some of the stories were obviously invented (European governments are stealing children from straight families and giving them to gay couples! ), but even the true ones were cherry-picked to support the idea that daily life in Europe is frightening and chaotic, that Europeans are weak and immoral, and that the European Union is aggressive and interventionist. If anything, the portrayal of America has been more dramatic. Putin himself has displayed a surprisingly intimate acquaintance with American culture wars about transgender rights, and mockingly sympathized with people who he says have been ""canceled.""

The goal is clear: to prevent Russians from identifying with Europe the way they once did, and to build alliances between Putin's domestic audience and his supporters in Europe and North America, where some naive conservatives (or perhaps cynical, well-paid conservatives) seek to convince their followers that Russia is a ""white Christian state."" In reality, Russia has very low church attendance, legal abortion, and a multiethnic population containing millions of Muslim citizens and migrants. The autonomous region of Chechnya, which is part of the Russian Federation, is governed, in practice, by elements of Sharia law. The Russian state harasses and represses many forms of religion outside the state-sanctioned Russian Orthodox Church, including evangelical Protestantism. Nevertheless, among the slogans shouted by white nationalists marching in the infamous Charlottesville, Virginia, demonstration in 2017 was ""Russia is our friend."" Putin sends periodic messages to this constituency: ""I uphold the traditional approach that a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a mother is a mother, and a father is a father,"" he told a press conference in December 2021, almost as if this ""traditional approach"" would be justification for invading Ukraine.

Michael Carpenter: Russia is co-opting angry young men

This manipulation of the strong emotions around gay rights and feminism has been widely copied throughout the autocratic world, often as a means of defending against criticism of the regime. Yoweri Museveni, who has been the president of Uganda for more than three decades, passed an ""anti-homosexuality"" bill in 2014, instituting a life sentence for gay people who have sex or marry and criminalizing the ""promotion"" of a homosexual lifestyle. By picking a fight over gay rights, he was able to consolidate his supporters at home while neutralizing foreign criticisms of his regime, describing them as ""social imperialism"": ""Outsiders cannot dictate to us; this is our country,"" he declared. Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary, also ducks discussion of Hungarian corruption by hiding behind a culture war. He pretends that ongoing tension between his government and the U.S. ambassador to Hungary concerns religion and gender: During Tucker Carlson's recent visit to Hungary, Carlson declared that the Biden administration ""hates"" Hungary because ""it's a Christian country,"" when in fact it is Orbán's deep financial and political ties to Russia and China that have badly damaged American-Hungarian relations.

The new authoritarians also have a different attitude toward reality. When Soviet leaders lied, they tried to make their falsehoods seem real. They became angry when anyone accused them of lying. But in Putin's Russia, Bashar al-Assad's Syria, and Nicolás Maduro's Venezuela, politicians and television personalities play a different game. They lie constantly, blatantly, obviously. But they don't bother to offer counterarguments when their lies are exposed. After Russian-controlled forces shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, the Russian government reacted not only with a denial, but with multiple stories, plausible and implausible: It blamed the Ukrainian army, and the CIA, and a nefarious plot in which dead people were placed on a plane in order to fake a crash and discredit Russia. This tactic -- the so-called fire hose of falsehoods -- ultimately produces not outrage but nihilism. Given so many explanations, how can you know what actually happened? What if you just can't know? If you don't know what happened, you're not likely to join a great movement for democracy, or to listen when anyone speaks about positive political change. Instead, you are not going to participate in any politics at all.

Anne Applebaum: The American face of authoritarian propaganda

Fear, cynicism, nihilism, and apathy, coupled with disgust and disdain for democracy: This is the formula that modern autocrats, with some variations, sell to their citizens and to foreigners, all with the aim of destroying what they call ""American hegemony."" In service of this idea, Russia, a colonial power, paints itself as a leader of the non-Western civilizations in what the analyst Ivan Klyszcz calls their struggle for ""messianic multipolarity,"" a battle against ""the West's imposition of 'decadent,' 'globalist' values."" In September 2022, when Putin held a ceremony to mark his illegal annexation of southern and eastern Ukraine, he claimed that he was protecting Russia from the ""satanic"" West and ""perversions that lead to degradation and extinction."" He did not speak of the people he had tortured or the Ukrainian children he had kidnapped. A year later, Putin told a gathering in Sochi: ""We are now fighting not just for Russia's freedom but for the freedom of the whole world. We can frankly say that the dictatorship of one hegemon is becoming decrepit. We see it, and everyone sees it now. It is getting out of control and is simply dangerous for others."" The language of ""hegemony"" and ""multipolarity"" is now part of Chinese, Iranian, and Venezuelan narratives too.

In truth, Russia is a genuine danger to its neighbors, which is why most of them are re-arming and preparing to fight against a new colonial occupation. The irony is even greater in African countries like Mali, where Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group have helped keep a military dictatorship in power, reportedly by conducting summary executions, committing atrocities against civilians, and looting property. In Mali, as in Ukraine, the battle against Western decadence means that white Russian thugs brutally terrorize people with impunity.

And yet Mali Actu, a pro-Russian website in Mali, solemnly explains to its readers that ""in a world that is more and more multipolar, Africa will play a more and more important role."" Mali Actu is not alone; it's just a small part of a propaganda network, created by the autocracies, that is now visible all over the world.

The infrastructure of antidemocratic propaganda takes many forms, some overt and some covert, some aimed at the public and some aimed at elites. The United Front, the fulcrum of the Chinese Communist Party's most important influence strategy, seeks to shape perceptions of China around the world by creating educational and exchange programs, controlling Chinese exile communities, building Chinese chambers of commerce, and courting anyone willing to be a de facto spokesperson for China. The Confucius Institutes are probably the best-known elite Chinese influence project. Originally perceived as benign cultural bodies not unlike the Goethe-Institut, run by the German government, and the Alliance Française, they were welcomed by many universities because they provided cheap or even free Chinese-language classes and professors. Over time, the institutes aroused suspicion, policing Chinese students at American universities by restricting open discussions of Tibet and Taiwan, and in some cases altering the teaching of Chinese history and politics to suit Chinese narratives. They have now been mostly disbanded in the United States. But they are flourishing in many other places, including Africa, where there are several dozen.

These subtler operations are augmented by China's enormous investment in international media. The Xinhua wire service, the China Global Television Network, China Radio International, and China Daily all receive significant state financing, have social-media accounts in multiple languages and regions, and sell, share, or otherwise promote their content. These Chinese outlets cover the entire world, and provide feeds of slickly produced news and video segments to their partners at low prices, sometimes for free, which makes them more than competitive with reputable Western newswires, such as Reuters and the Associated Press. Scores of news organizations in Europe and Asia use Chinese content, as do many in Africa, from Kenya and Nigeria to Egypt and Zambia. Chinese media maintain a regional hub in Nairobi, where they hire prominent local journalists and produce content in African languages. Building this media empire has been estimated to cost billions of dollars a year.

For the moment, viewership of many of these Chinese-owned channels remains low; their output can be predictable, even boring. But more popular forms of Chinese television are gradually becoming available. StarTimes, a satellite-television company that is tightly linked to the Chinese government, launched in Africa in 2008 and now has 13 million television subscribers in more than 30 African countries. StarTimes is cheap for consumers, costing just a few dollars a month. It prioritizes Chinese content -- not just news but kung-fu movies, soap operas, and Chinese Super League football, with the dialogue and commentary all translated into Hausa, Swahili, and other African languages. In this way, even entertainment can carry China-positive messages.

This subtler shift is the real goal: to have the Chinese point of view appear in the local press, with local bylines. Chinese propagandists call this strategy ""borrowing boats to reach the sea,"" and it can be achieved in many ways. Unlike Western governments, China doesn't think of propaganda, censorship, diplomacy, and media as separate activities. Legal pressure on news organizations, online trolling operations aimed at journalists, cyberattacks -- all of these can be deployed as part of a single operation designed to promulgate or undermine a given narrative. China also offers training courses or stipends for local journalists across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, sometimes providing phones and laptops in exchange for what the regime hopes will be favorable coverage.

The Chinese also cooperate, both openly and discreetly, with the media outlets of other autocracies. Telesur, a Hugo Chávez project launched in 2005, is headquartered in Caracas and led by Venezuela in partnership with Cuba and Nicaragua. Selectively culled bits of foreign news make it onto Telesur from its partners, including headlines that presumably have limited appeal in Latin America: ""US-Armenia Joint Military Drills Undermine Regional Stability,"" for example, and ""Russia Has No Expansionist Plans in Europe."" Both of these stories, from 2023, were lifted directly from the Xinhua wire.

Iran, for its part, offers HispanTV, the Spanish-language version of Press TV, the Iranian international service. HispanTV leans heavily into open anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial: One March 2020 headline declared that the ""New Coronavirus Is the Result of a Zionist Plot."" Spain banned HispanTV and Google blocked it from its YouTube and Gmail accounts, but the service is easily available across Latin America, just as Al-Alam, the Arabic version of Press TV, is widely available in the Middle East. After the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an international group dedicated to fighting disinformation, found that Iran was creating additional hacking groups to target digital, physical, and electoral infrastructure in Israel (where it went after electoral rolls) and the United States. In the future, these hacking operations may be combined with propaganda campaigns.

RT -- Russia Today -- has a bigger profile than either Telesur or Press TV; in Africa, it has close links to China. Following the invasion of Ukraine, some satellite networks dropped RT. But China's StarTimes satellite picked it up, and RT immediately began building offices and relationships across Africa, especially in countries run by autocrats who echo its anti-Western, anti-LGBTQ messages, and who appreciate its lack of critical or investigative reporting.

RT -- like Press TV, Telesur, and even CGTN -- also functions as a production facility, a source of video clips that can be spread online, repurposed and reused in targeted campaigns. Americans got a firsthand view of how the clandestine versions work in 2016, when the Internet Research Agency -- now disbanded but based then in St. Petersburg and led by the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, more famous as the mercenary boss of the Wagner Group who staged an aborted march on Moscow -- pumped out fake material via fake Facebook and Twitter accounts, designed to confuse American voters. Examples ranged from virulently anti-immigration accounts aimed at benefiting Donald Trump to fake Black Lives Matter accounts that attacked Hillary Clinton from the left.

Since 2016, these tactics have been applied across the globe. The Xinhua and RT offices in Africa and around the world -- along with Telesur and HispanTV -- create stories, slogans, memes, and narratives promoting the worldview of the autocracies; these, in turn, are repeated and amplified in many countries, translated into many languages, and reshaped for many local markets. The material produced is mostly unsophisticated, but it is inexpensive and can change quickly, according to the needs of the moment. After the October 7 Hamas attack, for example, official and unofficial Russian sources immediately began putting out both anti-Israel and anti-Semitic material, and messages calling American and Western support for Ukraine hypocritical in light of the Gaza conflict. The data-analytics company Alto Intelligence found posts smearing both Ukrainians and Israelis as ""Nazis,"" part of what appears to be a campaign to bring far-left and far-right communities closer together in opposition to U.S.-allied democracies. Anti-Semitic and pro-Hamas messages also increased inside China, as well as on Chinese-linked accounts around the world. Joshua Eisenman, a professor at Notre Dame and the author of a new book on China's relations with Africa, told me that during a recent trip to Beijing, he was astonished by how quickly the previous Chinese line on the Middle East -- ""China-Israel relations are stronger than ever"" -- changed. ""It was a complete 180 in just a few days.""

Not that everyone hearing these messages will necessarily know where they come from, because they often appear in forums that conceal their origins. Most people probably did not hear the American-biolabs conspiracy theory on a television news program, for example. Instead, they heard it thanks to organizations like Pressenza and Yala News. Pressenza, a website founded in Milan and relocated to Ecuador in 2014, publishes in eight languages, describes itself as ""an international news agency dedicated to news about peace and nonviolence,"" and featured an article on biolabs in Ukraine. According to the U.S. State Department, Pressenza is part of a project, run by three Russian companies, that planned to create articles in Moscow and then translate them for these ""native"" sites, following Chinese practice, to make them seem ""local."" Pressenza denied the allegations; one of its journalists, Oleg Yasinsky, who says he is of Ukrainian origin, responded by denouncing America's ""planetary propaganda machine"" and quoting Che Guevara.

Like Pressenza, Yala News also markets itself as independent. This U.K.-registered, Arabic-language news operation provides slickly produced videos, including celebrity interviews, to its 3 million followers every day. In March 2022, as the biolabs allegation was being promoted by other outlets, the site posted a video that echoed one of the most sensational versions: Ukraine was planning to use migratory birds as a delivery vehicle for bioweapons, infecting the birds and then sending them into Russia to spread disease.

Yala did not invent this ludicrous tale: Russian state media, such as the Sputnik news agency, published it in Russian first, followed by Sputnik's Arabic website and RT Arabic. Russia's United Nations ambassador addressed the UN Security Council about the biobird scandal, warning of the ""real biological danger to the people in European countries, which can result from an uncontrolled spread of bioagents from Ukraine."" In an April 2022 interview in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, and me that the biobirds story reminded him of a Monty Python sketch. If Yala were truly an ""independent"" publication, as it describes itself, it would have fact-checked this story, which, like the other biolab conspiracies, was widely debunked.

Read: Anne Applebaum and Jeffrey Goldberg interview Volodymyr Zelensky

But Yala News is not a news organization at all. As the BBC has reported, it's an information laundromat, a site that exists to spread and propagate material produced by RT and other Russian facilities. Yala News has posted claims that the Russian massacre of Ukrainian civilians at Bucha was staged, that Zelensky appeared drunk on television, and that Ukrainian soldiers were running away from the front lines. Although the company is registered to an address in London -- a mail drop shared by 65,000 other companies -- its ""news team"" is based in a suburb of Damascus. The company's CEO is a Syrian businessman based in Dubai who, when asked by the BBC, insisted on the organization's ""impartiality.""

Another strange actor in this field is RRN -- the company's name is an acronym, originally for Reliable Russian News, later changed to Reliable Recent News. Created in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, RRN, part of a bigger information-laundering operation known to investigators as Doppelganger, is primarily a ""typosquatter"": a company that registers domain names that look similar to real media domain names -- Reuters.cfd instead of Reuters.com, for example -- as well as websites with names that sound authentic (like Notre Pays, or ""Our Country"") but are created to deceive. RRN is prolific. During its short existence, it has created more than 300 sites targeting Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Links to these sites are then used to make Facebook, Twitter, and other social-media posts appear credible. When someone is quickly scrolling, they might not notice that a headline links to a fake Spiegel.pro website, say, rather than to the authentic German-magazine website Spiegel.de.

Doppelganger's efforts, run by a clutch of companies in Russia, have varied widely, and seem to have included fake NATO press releases, with the same fonts and design as the genuine releases, ""revealing"" that NATO leaders were planning to deploy Ukrainian paramilitary troops to France to quell pension protests. In November, operatives who the French government believes are linked to Doppelganger spray-painted Stars of David around Paris and posted them on social media, hoping to amplify French divisions over the Gaza war. Russian operatives built a social-media network to spread the false stories and the photographs of anti-Semitic graffiti. The goal is to make sure that the people encountering this content have little clue as to who created it, or where or why.

Russia and China are not the only parties in this space. Both real and automated social-media accounts geolocated to Venezuela played a small role in the 2018 Mexican presidential election, for example, boosting the campaign of Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Notable were two kinds of messages: those that promoted images of Mexican violence and chaos -- images that might make people feel they need an autocrat to restore order -- and those that were angrily opposed to NAFTA and the U.S. more broadly. This tiny social-media investment must have been deemed successful. After he became president, López Obrador engaged in the same kinds of smear campaigns as unelected politicians in autocracies, empowered and corrupted the military, undermined the independence of the judiciary, and otherwise degraded Mexican democracy. In office, he has promoted Russian narratives about the war in Ukraine along with Chinese narratives about the repression of the Uyghurs. Mexico's relationship with the United States has become more difficult -- and that, surely, was part of the point.

None of these efforts would succeed without local actors who share the autocratic world's goals. Russia, China, and Venezuela did not invent anti-Americanism in Mexico. They did not invent Catalan separatism, to name another movement that both Russian and Venezuelan social-media accounts supported, or the German far right, or France's Marine Le Pen. All they do is amplify existing people and movements -- whether anti-LGBTQ, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-Ukrainian, or, above all, antidemocratic. Sometimes they provide a social-media echo. Sometimes they employ reporters and spokespeople. Sometimes they use the media networks they built for this purpose. And sometimes, they just rely on Americans to do it for them.

Here is a difficult truth: A part of the American political spectrum is not merely a passive recipient of the combined authoritarian narratives that come from Russia, China, and their ilk, but an active participant in creating and spreading them. Like the leaders of those countries, the American MAGA right also wants Americans to believe that their democracy is degenerate, their elections illegitimate, their civilization dying. The MAGA movement's leaders also have an interest in pumping nihilism and cynicism into the brains of their fellow citizens, and in convincing them that nothing they see is true. Their goals are so similar that it is hard to distinguish between the online American alt-right and its foreign amplifiers, who have multiplied since the days when this was solely a Russian project. Tucker Carlson has even promoted the fear of a color revolution in America, lifting the phrase directly from Russian propaganda. The Chinese have joined in too: Earlier this year, a group of Chinese accounts that had previously been posting pro-Chinese material in Mandarin began posting in English, using MAGA symbols and attacking President Joe Biden. They showed fake images of Biden in prison garb, made fun of his age, and called him a satanist pedophile. One Chinese-linked account reposted an RT video repeating the lie that Biden had sent a neo-Nazi criminal to fight in Ukraine. Alex Jones's reposting of the lie on social media reached some 400,000 people.

Given that both Russian and Chinese actors now blend in so easily with the MAGA messaging operation, it is hardly surprising that the American government has difficulty responding to the newly interlinked autocratic propaganda network. American-government-backed foreign broadcasters -- Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Farda, Radio Martí -- still exist, but neither their mandate nor their funding has changed much in recent years. The intelligence agencies continue to observe what happens -- there is a Foreign Malign Influence Center under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence -- but they are by definition not part of the public debate. The only relatively new government institution fighting antidemocratic propaganda is the Global Engagement Center, but it is in the State Department, and its mandate is to focus on authoritarian propaganda outside the United States. Established in 2016, it replaced the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, which sought to foil the Islamic State and other jihadist groups that were recruiting young people online. In 2014-15, as the scale of Russian disinformation campaigns in Europe were becoming better known, Congress designated the GEC to deal with Russian as well as Chinese, Iranian, and other propaganda campaigns around the world -- although not, again, inside the United States. Throughout the Trump administration, the organization languished under the direction of a president who himself repeated Russian propaganda lines during the 2016 campaign -- ""Obama founded ISIS,"" for example, and ""Hillary will start World War III.""

Today the GEC is run by James Rubin, a former State Department spokesperson from the Bill Clinton era. It employs 125 people and has a budget of $61 million -- hardly a match for the many billions that China and Russia spend building their media networks. But it is beginning to find its footing, handing out small grants to international groups that track and reveal foreign disinformation operations. It's now specializing in identifying covert propaganda campaigns before they begin, with the help of U.S. intelligence agencies. Rubin calls this ""prebunking"" and describes it as a kind of ""inoculation"": ""If journalists and governments know that this is coming, then when it comes, they will recognize it.""

The revelation in November of the Russian ties to seemingly native left-wing websites in Latin America, including Pressenza, was one such effort. More recently, the GEC published a report on the African Initiative, an agency that had planned a huge campaign to discredit Western health philanthropy, starting with rumors about a new virus supposedly spread by mosquitoes. The idea was to smear Western doctors, clinics, and philanthropists, and to build a climate of distrust around Western medicine, much as Russian efforts helped build a climate of distrust around Western vaccines during the pandemic. The GEC identified the Russian leader of the project, Artem Sergeyevich Kureyev; noted that several employees had come to the African Initiative from the Wagner Group; and located two of its offices, in Mali and Burkina Faso. Rubin and others subsequently spent a lot of time talking with regional reporters about the African Initiative's plans so that ""people will recognize them"" when they launch. Dozens of articles in English, Spanish, and other languages have described these operations, as have thousands of social-media posts. Eventually, the goal is to create an alliance of other nations who also want to share information about planned and ongoing information operations so that everyone knows they are coming.

It's a great idea, but no equivalent agency functions inside the United States. Some social-media companies have made purely voluntary efforts to remove foreign-government propaganda, sometimes after being tipped off by the U.S. government but mostly on their own. In the U.S., Facebook created a security-policy unit that still regularly announces when it discovers ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" -- meaning accounts that are automated and/or evidently part of a planned operation from (usually) Russian, Iranian, or Chinese sources -- and then takes down the posts. It is difficult for outsiders to monitor this activity, because the company restricts access to its data, and even controls the tools that can be used to examine the data. In March, Meta announced that by August, it would phase out CrowdTangle, a tool used to analyze Facebook data, and replace it with a tool that analysts fear will be harder to use.

X (formerly Twitter) also used to look for foreign propaganda activity, but under the ownership of Elon Musk, that voluntary effort has been badly weakened. The new blue-check ""verification"" process allows users -- including anonymous, pro-Russian users -- to pay to have their posts amplified; the old ""safety team"" no longer exists. The result: After the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine last summer, a major environmental and humanitarian disaster caused by Russian bombing over many weeks, the false narrative that Ukraine had destroyed it appeared hundreds of thousands of times on X. After the ISIS terrorist attack on a concert hall in Moscow in March, David Sacks, the former PayPal entrepreneur and a close associate of Musk's, posted on X, with no evidence, that ""if the Ukrainian government was behind the terrorist attack, as looks increasingly likely, the U.S. must renounce it."" His completely unfounded post was viewed 2.5 million times. This spring, some Republican congressional leaders finally began speaking about the Russian propaganda that had ""infected"" their base and their colleagues. Most of that ""Russian propaganda"" is not coming from inside Russia.

Over the past several years, universities and think tanks have used their own data analytics to try to identify inauthentic networks on the largest websites -- but they are also now meeting resistance from MAGA-affiliated Republican politicians. In 2020, teams at Stanford University and the University of Washington, together with the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council and Graphika, a company that specializes in social-media analytics, decided to join forces to monitor false election information. Renée DiResta, one of the leaders of what became the Election Integrity Partnership, told me that an early concern was Russian and Chinese campaigns. DiResta assumed that these foreign interventions wouldn't matter much, but she thought it would be useful and academically interesting to understand their scope. ""Lo and behold,"" she said, ""the entity that becomes the most persistent in alleging that American elections are fraudulent, fake, rigged, and everything else turns out to be the president of the United States."" The Election Integrity Partnership tracked election rumors coming from across the political spectrum, but observed that the MAGA right was far more prolific and significant than any other source.

The Election Integrity Partnership was not organized or directed by the U.S. government. It occasionally reached out to platforms, but had no power to compel them to act, DiResta told me. Nevertheless, the project became the focus of a complicated MAGA-world conspiracy theory about alleged government suppression of free speech, and it led to legal and personal attacks on many of those involved. The project has been smeared and mischaracterized by some of the journalists attached to Musk's ""Twitter Files"" investigation, and by Representative Jim Jordan's Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. A series of lawsuits alleging that the U.S. government sought to suppress conservative speech, including one launched by Missouri and Louisiana that has now reached the Supreme Court, has effectively tried to silence organizations that investigate both domestic and foreign disinformation campaigns, overt and covert. To state baldly what is happening: The Republican Party's right wing is actively harassing legitimate, good-faith efforts to track the production and dissemination of autocratic disinformation here in the United States.

Over time, the attack on the Election Integrity Partnership has itself acquired some of the characteristics of a classic information-laundering operation. The most notorious example concerns a reference, on page 183 of the project's final post-2020-election report, to the 21,897,364 tweets gathered after the election, in an effort to catalog the most viral false rumors. That simple statement of the size of the database has been twisted into another false and yet constantly repeated rumor: the spurious claim that the Department of Homeland Security somehow conspired with the Election Integrity Partnership to censor 22 million tweets. This never happened, and yet DiResta said that ""this nonsense about the 22 million tweets pops up constantly as evidence of the sheer volume of our duplicity""; it has even appeared in the Congressional Record.

The same tactics have been used against the Global Engagement Center. In 2021, the GEC gave a grant to another organization, the Global Disinformation Index, which helped develop a technical tool to track online campaigns in East Asia and Europe. For a completely unrelated, separately funded project, the Global Disinformation Index also conducted a study, aimed at advertisers, that identified websites at risk for publishing false stories. Two conservative organizations, finding their names on that latter list, sued the GEC, although it had nothing to do with creating the list. Musk posted, again without any evidence, ""The worst offender in US government censorship & media manipulation is an obscure agency called GEC,"" and that organization also became caught up in the endless whirlwind of conspiracy and congressional investigations.

As it happens, I was caught up in it too, because I was listed online as an ""adviser"" to the Global Disinformation Index, even though I had not spoken with anyone at the organization for several years and was not aware that it even had a website. A predictable, and wearisome, pattern followed: false accusations (no, I was not advising anyone to censor anyone) and the obligatory death threats. Of course, my experience was mild compared with the experience of DiResta, who has been accused of being, as she put it, ""the head of a censorship-industrial complex that does not exist.""

These stories are symptomatic of a larger problem: Because the American extreme right and (more rarely) the extreme left benefit from the spread of antidemocratic narratives, they have an interest in silencing or hobbling any group that wants to stop, or even identify, foreign campaigns. Senator Mark Warner, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told me that ""we are actually less prepared today than we were four years ago"" for foreign attempts to influence the 2024 election. This is not only because authoritarian propaganda campaigns have become more sophisticated as they begin to use AI, or because ""you obviously have a political environment here where there's a lot more Americans who are more distrustful of all institutions."" It's also because the lawsuits, threats, and smear tactics have chilled government, academic, and tech-company responses.

One could call this a secret authoritarian ""plot"" to preserve the ability to spread antidemocratic conspiracy theories, except that it's not a secret. It's all visible, right on the surface. Russia, China, and sometimes other state actors -- Venezuela, Iran, Hungary -- work with Americans to discredit democracy, to undermine the credibility of democratic leaders, to mock the rule of law. They do so with the goal of electing Trump, whose second presidency would damage the image of democracy around the world, as well as the stability of democracy in America, even further.",theatlantic.com,news,The Atlantic,Anne Applebaum,0.02745098039215677,452686485,13,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/RP_Ta0NG3eeEL04hTbhkL4ruV38=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/2024/05/WEL_Applebaum_PropagandaHP-1/original.png,

of the legal opinion, and also welcoming the adoption by the UNGA 77th Session a request for an

advisory opinion from the ICJ on the legal implications of the Israeli occupation's policies and practices

in Palestine, including East Al-Quds, and the consequences of this occupation and the illegal practices

associated with it, and thanks the Member States that supported the State of Palestine in this endeavor

by submitting legal pleadings in this regard before the ICJ,

Considering all resolutions and recommendations of reports issued by the UN, the Human Rights

Council (HRC), commissions of inquiry, and special rapporteurs relating to Israeli violations of human

rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Al-Quds and other Arab territories occupied

since 1967, as well as resolutions issued by the Non-Aligned Movement, the African Union, and the

League of Arab States, all of which affirm that the Israeli colonial occupation of Palestinian land and

discrimination against Palestinians are the ""root causes"" of the recurring tensions, instability and

prolongation of conflict in the region, and call for ensuring the accountability of the occupying state

for its violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including

putting an end to Israel's impunity,

Recalling the Nakba as a historical human tragedy and catastrophe in the context of a colonial plan

that began with the Balfour Declaration in 1917 and included systematic Jewish immigration to

Palestine and the commission of the crime of ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people at the hands of

Zionist gangs since 1947, which led to the forcible displacement of nearly a million Palestinian Arabs

from their land, robbery of their property and cultural heritage, the attempt to tear apart their social

fabric, the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian towns and villages, and the continuation of the Nakba

by continuing the racist Israeli colonial occupation, its aggression against the Palestinian people and

their land and the denial of their legitimate rights, including their right to return and self-determination,

Condemning the continuation of the illegal Israeli military occupation of the occupied territory of the

State of Palestine, and all of its intensive and systematic colonial activities in all their manifestations,

and renewing its call to the international community and international organizations to work to

immediately end this settler colonial occupation and the apartheid regime it established, and

denouncing all systematic and widespread Israeli crimes and violations and the escalation against the

defenseless Palestinian people, including field executions, arbitrary detention, torture, forced

displacement, house demolitions, land confiscation and other acts of violence, as well as the apartheid

policies that it established to consolidate its colonization of the land of the State of Palestine, and

stressing the responsibility of the international community to hold Israel, the colonial occupation

power, accountable and taking practical steps, including imposing penalties for all these crimes, in

accordance with international law and international humanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva

Convention, to ensure their non-recurrence by activating the legal and international frameworks that

provide protection for the Palestinian people,

Commending the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and their just and valiant struggle to achieve

their legitimate national aspirations and realize their inalienable rights, including the right to selfdetermination, independence, sovereignty over their land, and the return of refugees to their homes,

1. Reaffirms the centrality of the Palestine Cause, with Holy Al-Quds at its heart for the entire Islamic

Ummah, the Arab and Islamic identity of occupied Al-Quds, and the necessity of defending the sanctity

of the Islamic and Christian holy places therein; also affirms at the same time that this Cause is similar

to all other just causes of peoples struggling to break free from colonialism and gain their rights.

2. Condemnsin the strongest terms the genocide being committed by the Israeli occupation forces against

the Palestinian people in the besieged Gaza Strip and the entire occupied Palestinian territory, including

Al-Quds, including killing, bombing, starvation, and destruction of civilian objects and infrastructure,

which claimed the lives of over 34500 Palestinian citizens, and injured over 77500 others, the majority

of whom are women and children, in addition to the displacement of over 1.7 million Palestinians, and

reiterates its absolute rejection of any justification for this barbaric aggression that targets civilians,

and insists on starving them, depriving them of basic materials and safe access to humanitarian aid,

and forcibly deporting them under any pretext in contravention of all international norms and laws, and

the most basic human principles and values, and allows the continuation of the crime of genocide.

3. Emphasizes the significant efforts undertaken by the Arab-Islamic Ministerial Group, headed by the

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,, Chair of the 32nd Session of the Arab Summit and the 14th Session of the

Islamic Summit Conference, and the Extraordinary Joint Arab and Islamic Summit, with the

membership of Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye, Indonesia and Nigeria, on behalf of all

Member States of the OIC and the League of Arab States, with the aim of ending the crimes of genocide

committed by Israel against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, and ending the long-standing

Israeli colonial occupation of the State of Palestine, achieve the vision of the two-state solution, and

thus reach lasting and comprehensive peace in accordance with international law and UN resolutions,

and calls on them to continue their efforts in this regard in order to stop the barbaric aggression against

the Palestinian people and end the causes that lead to its continuation, and to adopt a new approach to

enable the Palestinian people to exercise their rights, including ending the colonial occupation and

granting the State of Palestine its independence.

4. Calls on the OIC Member States to exercise diplomatic, political and legal pressure and to take any

deterrent measures to stop the crimes of the Israeli colonial occupation, and the genocidal war it is

waging against the Palestinian people, including by imposing sanctions at all international economic,

sports and cultural levels, expelling Israel from international organizations and forums, refraining from

supporting its candidacy to international positions, and freezing the assets of persons and entities

proven to have been involved in the crimes committed against the Palestinian People; urges the OIC

Member States to consider imposing sanctions on persons/entities that support Israel in its crimes

against the Palestinian people, and requests the OIC General Secretariat to consider this measure in

all its aspects and to report thereon to the Member States;

5. Demands an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and cessation of the all-out aggression against the

Palestinian people in Gaza, the provision of humanitarian, medical, and relief aid, the provision of

water and electricity, and the opening of humanitarian corridors to deliver urgent aid to the Gaza Strip

in an unimpeded and adequate manner; Warns of the danger of continuing the crime of genocide and

ethnic cleansing, including starvation, deprivation of water, and preventing entry of fuel, which led to a genuine disaster for all health and humanitarian sectors; and Calls for an immediate investigation

into these crimes, including the horrific mass graves that were recently discovered in many locations

in the Gaza Strip, and stresses the responsibility of all States to confront and stop this crime, and to

strictly comply with the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice, and rejects

characterizing the genocide committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people as selfdefense or justifying it under any pretext;

6. Deplores the positions of some countries that apply double standards and support the brutal aggression

against the Palestinian people, granting the Israeli occupation immunity and providing it with impunity,

and affirms that these positions are inconsistent with international law and UN resolutions and will

only increase the cycle of violence and destruction, fuel extremism, and escalate the conflict in the

region, and punish the Palestinian people, including inflammatory speeches that call for genocide and

strip the Palestinian people of their humanity.

7. Urgently calls on the OIC Member States to do everything necessary at all levels to stop and confront

the crimes committed by the occupation against the Palestinian people, hold their perpetrators, be they

civilian or military, accountable and bring them to justice, provide all forms of financial support and

humanitarian relief, and work to lift the siege imposed on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip since

over 16 years.

8. Condemns the crime of forced disappearance committed by the occupation forces since the beginning

of the current aggression against thousands of Palestinian citizens in the Gaza Strip and throughout the

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including women, children, and the elderly, in addition to the abuse,

oppression, torture, and humiliating and degrading treatment to which they are subjected, and calls on

the OIC Member States to act at all levels to uncover the fate of the abductees, release them

immediately, ensure protection for them, and demand an independent and transparent investigation into

this crime, including the policy of executing Palestinian detainees in its prisons. (Jordan)

9. Stresses that it fully and absolutely rejects and stands collectively against any attempts at individual or

collective forced transfer, displacement, exile, or deportation of the Palestinian people, whether inside

the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, including Al-Quds, or outside their territories to any other destination,

whatever it is, as this amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity, and emphasized the

collective response to these attempts.

10. Emphasizes the central significance of the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 2720

and the necessity for the United Nations Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance and Reconstruction

in Gaza to assume her responsibilities in the meticulous implementation of the said resolution and the

establishment of a mechanism within the Gaza Strip to facilitate entry of humanitarian assistance and

avoid Israeli obstacles, in full cooperation and coordination with United Nations agencies operating in

the Gaza Strip, especially UNRWA, to allow for the immediate flow of humanitarian aid through all

crossings between Israel, the colonial occupation authority and the Gaza Strip, while holding the Israeli

occupation responsible as an occupying authority.

11. Supports the role of the Arab Republic of Egypt in providing and facilitating entry of humanitarian

aid into Gaza, supports all the steps it takes to confront the consequences of the brutal Israeli

aggression on Gaza, as well as its efforts to bring aid into the Gaza Strip in an immediate, sustainable

and adequate manner, in addition to its role in ending the aggression

12. Condemns the systematic and widespread colonial policies of the Israeli government and all frantic

colonial activities in all their manifestations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Al-Quds, which constitutes a grave violation of international law as a war crime and a crime against

humanity and undermines the chances of reaching a political settlement based on the two-state solution,

and expresses its deep concern about the successive settlement announcements of Israel, the colonial

occupying power, and all other colonial practices that endanger international peace and security.

13. Condemns also the system of oppression established by the Israeli colonial occupation, including the

ongoing arbitrary detention campaigns that affect all the Palestinian people, including children and

women, in addition to the policy of administrative detention that violates an inherent human right and

expresses deep concern about the unjust, inhumane conditions to which Palestinian prisoners,

specifically children, are exposed in Israeli detention centers, their continued detention, torture and

deprivation of appropriate health care, and the humiliating treatment of their families by Israel, the

colonial occupation authority, including depriving them of visits, confirmsthe illegitimacy of the racist

Israeli judicial system that permits such illegal and inhumane policies, and calls on all international

bodies, the Red Cross, and the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions to assume their

responsibilities in this regard.

14. Condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist acts committed by the Israeli settlers against defenseless

Palestinian citizens and their property, which have escalated dangerously under the protection of the

Israeli colonial occupation forces by arming them and inciting the killing of Palestinians, and in this

regard calls for the settlers to be held accountable for the crimes they commit against the Palestinian

people and their property, and to work to classify the Jewish settlement movements and their

accomplices as terrorist groups, organizations, and armed militias and include them on global terrorist

lists, including the UN lists, calls on the General Secretariat, in cooperation with the State of Palestine,

to prepare this list and circulate it to the Member States to take the necessary measures, and welcomes

the decisions of countries that imposed sanctions on several settlers on the grounds of committing

terrorist acts, crimes and attacks against Palestinian citizens, and considers it a step in the right

direction towards imposing comprehensive sanctions on the settler colonial system on the land of the

State of Palestine.

15. Affirms that peace and security in the Middle East region, as a strategic option and necessity, will not

be achieved except with the complete withdrawal of Israel, the occupying power, from the territory of

the State of Palestine occupied since 1967, especially Al-Quds Ash-Sharif, in accordance with

international law and what is stipulated in the relevant international resolutions, and the Arab Peace

Initiative, with all its elements and its natural sequence, as stated in the Beirut Summit in 2002, which

stipulated that peace with Israel must be preceded by ending its occupation of the Palestinian and Arab

Image by greyj via iStock

The European Commission is offering up to EUR 850 million ($914.8 million) in funding for cross-border energy infrastructure projects such as carbon capture facilities, energy storage facilities, gas pipelines, hydrogen market hubs and power grid interconnections.

This is the first grant offer under the revised Trans-European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) Regulation, which took effect June 2022 aligning with the European Union's goal of turning into a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, the Commission said in a press release.

Projects eligible for the inaugural rollout must be among the preapproved list of so-called projects of common interest (PCIs) and projects of mutual interest (PMIs), formulated under the TEN-E Regulation and published November 28, 2023, as Regulation 2022/869. For the first time, offshore electricity grids and hydrogen projects can qualify for TEN-E support.

TEN-E projects receive EU assistance through the 2021-27 Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Energy, which has a budget of nearly EUR 6 billion ($64.6 billion).

""While fossil fuel projects have been excluded in principle from eligibility to PCI/PMI status and CEF Energy, new types of projects such as offshore electricity grids and hydrogen projects have become eligible"", the Commission noted.

Accepted proposals for CEF Energy funding under the revised TEN-E Regulation are for project studies and construction works. In the inaugural offer, developers have until October 22, 2024, to make submissions. Results are planned to be made known next year, the Commission said.

The pre-approved list aims to scale up cleaner energy in the 27-member region, as well as help member states whose grid is still linked to Russia to migrate their power distribution system to continental Europe.

The pre-approved projects include north-south power interconnections in the Baltics, Central Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe and Western Europe; offshore grids in the Atlantic, North Sea, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and Western Europe; hydrogen production-distribution networks in the Baltics, Central Eastern, Southeastern and Western Europe; and carbon capture and storage networks in the Baltics, the Mediterranean, the North Sea and between Croatia and Hungary.

As a PCI, the migration of the grids of the three remaining EU countries connected to the Russian grid is targeted to be completed by February 2025. Last year the Commission and the three nations -- the Baltic Sea neighborhood of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- signed a declaration to fast-track the integration by nearly a year compared to what was agreed under a political declaration in 2018.

The new declaration also involves Poland. The grid migration plan for the Baltic states will use a new project linking the power supply systems of Lithuania and Poland, called the Harmony Link Interconnector.

""The three Baltic States are the last remaining EU Member States with electricity networks that are still synchronized with Russia and Belarus"", the Commission said in a statement December 24, 2023, announcing the signing of the new declaration. ""Their synchronization is a strategic project of common interest.

""Over the past 12 years, it has received significant political, technical, and financial EU support exceeding EUR 1.2 bn [$1.3 billion] worth of grants"".

The statement added, ""Under the political declaration, the Member States concerned also committed to speeding up the development of the 'Harmony Link Interconnector', one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects between Lithuania and Poland"".

Harmony Link is a submarine line about 330 kilometers long (205.1 miles) using a high-voltage direct current cable that would connect Poland's Zarnoviec substation and Ltihuania's Darbėnai substation. The second power interconnection between Lithuania and Poland after the LitPol project (operational since 2016), Harmony Link is expected to be completed 2028.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.388235294117647,452673176,7,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/EU-Offers-915MM-Grants-for-CrossBorder-Energy-Infra-Projects-176634-582x327.webp,

In this Q&A, Crisis Group experts Enrica Picco and Charles Bouëssel examine the issues at stake and the possible threats to the country's stability after the vote.

Chad is due to hold a presidential election on 6 May. What is at stake?

The 6 May presidential election will be the last stage in a transition marked by deep political and social tensions. The election has characteristics of previous contests in 2011, 2016 and 2021, when President Idriss Déby Itno (1990-2021), father of current president Mahamat Déby Itno, easily defeated members of the muzzled urban opposition, who have little support in the rural areas where 76 per cent of Chadians live. The younger Déby is the clear favourite to win this time around. He faces no strong opponent, apart from Succès Masra, head of the Les Transformateurs party. Masra lost much of his popularity in January, however, when he accepted the post of prime minister. A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power. He continues to attract large crowds to his campaign events, at which he openly criticises Déby and assures voters that his victory is possible. But few believe the vote will be close. On 23 March, the civil society platform Wakit Tama called on Chadians to boycott the election, describing it as a ""masquerade"" designed to perpetuate a ""dynastic dictatorship"". Post-election protests are possible, though the threat of police repression could dissuade many people from taking to the streets.

Beyond its democratic significance, this election marks the end of the political transition that began in April 2021, just after the elder Déby's death. Fearing a power vacuum, a group of generals appointed one of his sons, Mahamat, who was 37 at the time, to head a Transitional Military Council. Initially scheduled to last eighteen months, the transition has gone on for more than three years. Deviating from its usual practice, the African Union (AU) did not sanction N'Djamena for the unconstitutional change of power, arguing that Chad had made a significant contribution to fighting terrorism. In return, the AU demanded that the transitional leaders be ineligible to run in the elections that would follow.

Pressure on the opposition has increased in recent months, reaching a peak ... with the brutal death of opposition figure Yaya Dillo.

Despite this request, the transitional president announced that he would run. Pressure on the opposition has increased in recent months, reaching a peak on 28 February with the brutal death of opposition figure Yaya Dillo, leader of the Parti Socialiste Sans Frontières and Mahamat Déby's cousin. The government claims that Dillo was killed resisting arrest but members of the opposition say he was extrajudicially murdered in a military operation. During the same operation, the president's uncle, Salleh Déby, was also arrested. Dillo's death is a flagrant example of the growing dissension within the Zaghawa clan, of which the Déby family is a part. This clan represents just over 5 per cent of the Chadian population, but it has controlled the country for 30 years with the support of other northern elites belonging to the Gorane and Arab ethnic groups.

A number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility. The new electoral code, adopted during a parliamentary session lasting just two hours on 22 February, abolishes the National Election Management Agency's obligation to post the results at each polling station, instead providing only for publishing regional tallies, which will prevent observers from verifying results by adding up the numbers at polling stations. The Agency is mainly made up of members or close associates of the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS). The Constitutional Council, which validates candidacies and results, offers little guarantee of independence, as the younger Déby has appointed a former MPS executive, Jean Bernard Padaré, at its helm.

The Constitutional Council also rejected ten candidacies, including those of two prominent opposition figures: Ahmat Hassaballah Soubiane, a politician and diplomat of Arab origin, and Nassour Koursami, a Zaghawa and leader of the Groupe de concertation des acteurs politiques, a platform created in 2021. Following this decision, the opposition pointed out that all ten rejected candidates were from the north and centre of the country. These two rural regions are Mahamat Déby's electoral strongholds; according to the opposition, the Council sought to eliminate his potential competition there.

What were the transition's objectives, and have they been achieved?

When the transition began, many Chadians nurtured hopes of a change of power, after three decades of authoritarian rule dominated by the Déby family. Mahamat Déby showed signs of democratic openness, initiating negotiations with the opposition and civil society, and allowing several long-time dissident activists, such as Abel Maïna, Makaïla Nguebla, Tahirou Hissein Dagga and Habib Ben, to return to the country after years in exile. The president also promised a national dialogue to discuss institutional reform, a new constitution and a fresh presidential election.

Mahamat Déby also reached out to the many politico-military movements seeking a role in charting the country's future. He agreed to hold talks in Doha in March 2022, under the good offices of the Qatari authorities, where representatives of 52 movements met to negotiate participation in the national dialogue. The accord struck in Doha allowed the return of more exiles, such as Timan Erdimi, Idriss Déby's cousin and head of the rebel Union of Resistance Forces. But the two strongest rebel groups refused to sign, arguing that the government had not taken into consideration their demands regarding the conditions of their disarmament and the return of their fighters from abroad. These are the Libyan-based Front pour l'alternance et la concorde au Tchad, whose offensive on N'Djamena in April 2021 claimed the elder Déby's life, and the Conseil du commandement militaire pour le salut de la République, based in the Tibesti region, also on the Libyan border.

Launched in August 2022, the national dialogue was short-lived, dashing the democratic hopes of the early months. In the absence of a guarantee that Mahamat Déby would not run for president, one of their main demands, the main leaders of the civil and political-military opposition refused to take part. The dialogue therefore took place without the forces most in favour of regime change, such as Masra's Les Transformateurs and Wakit Tama, both of which have considerable constituencies in urban areas. The dialogue wound up extending the transition by two years. It also allowed the transitional leaders, including Déby, to stand for election. Despite this violation of its conditions imposed at the transition's outset, the AU member states were unable to reach consensus on sanctioning Chad.

In reaction to what it perceived as a betrayal, the opposition opted for a show of strength, calling for mass mobilisation against the regime. On 20 October 2022, the day that was to mark the end of the planned eighteen-month transition, thousands took to the streets, storming public buildings in N'Djamena and provincial towns such as Moundou, Doba, Koumra and Sahr. The brutal repression by the security forces resulted in 128 deaths, 518 injuries and over 900 arrests, according to the Chadian Human Rights Commission, creating a climate of fear and driving most prominent dissidents to go silent, return to exile or join the government.

The Economic Community of Central African States launched a mediation led by the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Faced with this crisis, the Economic Community of Central African States launched a mediation led by the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Félix Tshisekedi. But this effort failed to create the conditions for genuine national reconciliation. The agreement signed in Kinshasa in October 2023 between the Chadian government and the opposition involved only one party, Les Transformateurs, and consisted mainly of allowing Masra's return after a year in exile. This gesture had great symbolic significance, considering the polarisation of political discourse in the country following the previous October's crackdown. But there was more to the story: a few days after Masra came back to N'Djamena, parliament passed a general amnesty covering the 2022 events. This law dropped all charges against opposition figures who had been arrested, but it also buried Chadians' demands for enquiries shedding light on the responsibility of political and military leaders for the repression. Two months after this amnesty, Mahamat Déby appointed Masra as prime minister, greatly disappointing the erstwhile dissident's supporters.

The previous month, a constitutional referendum had enshrined the country's hyper-centralised presidential system, despite the opposition's objections. The national dialogue had envisaged that Chadians would be able to choose between a unitary but decentralised state and a federation. But the commission in charge of drafting the new constitution, made up largely of people affiliated with the regime, offered them no such choice; indeed, their draft strengthened the existing system. Notwithstanding images of largely empty polling stations on 17 December 2023, the government declared the new constitution approved by 86 per cent of voters, with a participation rate of 62 per cent. National and international observers, who had noted very low turnout at the polling stations they visited, expressed doubts that the official results were credible.

Finally, at the end of February, Mahamat Déby announced that the presidential election, initially scheduled for October, would take place earlier in the year, presenting this measure as fulfilling his pledge to complete the transition faster than neighbouring countries that have undergone unconstitutional changes of government. Opponents denounced the move as an attempt to speed up his own consolidation of power by burnishing his legitimacy as president on the national and international stage. It also decoupled the presidential and legislative elections, which were to have been held at the same time. The parliamentary vote is still slated for October, but there has been no confirmation for some time. Chadians have not voted for parliamentary representatives since 2011, and many fear that the decoupling is, in effect, another indefinite postponement.

What has happened to Chad's foreign policy over the past three years of transition?

Mahamat Déby has focused on security, looking to ensure that rebel movements cannot use neighbouring countries as rear bases. He has strengthened links with President Faustin-Archange Touadéra in the Central African Republic and with Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar in Libya. These closer ties have enabled Chad to carry out military operations against rebels on Central African and Libyan territory. Déby has also positioned himself on the regional chessboard by preserving his relationship with France while opening the door to new security and economic partnerships with the United Arab Emirates, Hungary and, more recently, Russia, although the contours of this last agreement remain unclear.

The recent wave of coups d'état in western Sahelian states, along with the outbreak of war in Sudan ... have made Chad look like an island of stability in the greater Sahel.

The recent wave of coups d'état in western Sahelian states, along with the outbreak of war in Sudan in April 2023, have made Chad look like an island of stability in the greater Sahel, as well as one of the few reliable allies for Western powers. Chad also prides itself on being the first country among those in the region that are undergoing political transitions, such as Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger and Gabon, to organise elections. N'Djamena has used its position to pre-empt international criticism of the transition's authoritarian drift.

Positioning himself in the Western camp has not prevented Mahamat Déby from playing an ambiguous geopolitical game. There are some 3,000 French soldiers in Chad and, aware of the unpopularity of France and the West, particularly among Chadian youth, Déby has purposely cast doubt on whether he will let such arrangements continue. About a hundred U.S. special forces personnel stationed at the Adji Kosseï air base near N'Djamena have been assisting the French army in fighting jihadists in the Sahel. On 4 April, the chief of staff of the Chadian air force, Amie Ahmed Idriss, asked the U.S. to halt these activities, claiming that the U.S. has not provided the necessary documents to justify its presence. (The request came on the heels of a similar one from the junta in Niger, where the U.S. has about 1,000 troops and is negotiating the terms of their withdrawal.) The U.S. special forces personnel left the Chadian capital a few days later. Washington now awaits the election result, after which it will reassess its partnership with N'Djamena.

Does regime continuity pose a risk to Chad's stability?

Even if the measures taken by Mahamat Déby to reinforce his power have enabled Chad to enjoy relative stability, they have not shielded it from other threats, internal and external, which are closely interlinked and whose evolution is unpredictable.

Inside the country, the balance among the ruling elite has never been so delicate, for several reasons. Mahamat Déby's tight grip on the army during the transition led more than a hundred generals close to his father to retire. Meanwhile, the younger Déby set up a new praetorian guard, the Rapid Intervention Force. These moves have heightened tensions within the Chadian government, due to the place that members of non-Zaghawa groups, especially Goranes (from whom Mahamat's mother is descended) and Arabs loyal to Mahamat Déby, have acquired in the army. Although Mahamat Déby has so far used the existing patronage system to calm tempers, these decisions could exacerbate frictions within the Zaghawa clan, whose cohesion has been put to the test since Dillo died, triggering a struggle for control of the country.

Chad's position in the Sudanese conflict is another major source of tension within the regime in N'Djamena. After first adopting a position of neutrality, Mahamat Déby subsequently authorised the UAE to supply arms and equipment to General Mohamed ""Hemedti"" Hamdan Dagalo's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) from Chadian territory. In parallel, Chad obtained a $1.5 billion loan, representing over 80 per cent of the state budget, as well as military equipment of its own. Intense disputes ensued within the Zaghawa clans. With strong family ties in both Chad and Sudan, this ethnic group is sharply divided. While some in N'Djamena approve of supporting the RSF, the Sudanese branch, based in North Darfur, has chosen the camp of its enemy, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan's regular Sudanese army. If clashes between the RSF and Zaghawa militias in Darfur escalate, the latter may seek revenge by backing a coup against the government in N'Djamena, as has happened in the past. The rumours of impending fighting in North Darfur, particularly around the town of El-Fasher, which is home to a large part of Darfur's Zaghawa community, greatly increase this risk.

In addition, social and communal tensions remain high in Chad. The transitional government has offered no real solution to the socio-economic crisis that has afflicted Chadians for years. Recent measures, such as an agreement with teachers, a reduction in transport taxes and subsidies on utilities, have not calmed social discontent. On the contrary, civil service wage arrears, rising fuel prices and water and electricity cuts have provoked repeated strikes. At the same time, inter-communal tensions are on the rise throughout the country. The south and centre are beset with conflict between herders and farmers, exacerbated by longstanding identity-based divisions, leading to the resurgence of secessionist grievances. The eastern provinces, meanwhile, are under unprecedented pressure from the arrival of over 600,000 Sudanese refugees, despite efforts by Chadian authorities since Sudan's war began to allow national and international humanitarian organisations to deliver aid. Competition for access to resources, particularly land, and rising inflation are likely to increase tensions in one of the country's poorest regions, where in March inter-communal clashes claimed dozens of lives in the space of a few days.

The struggle among world powers for influence in the Sahel is both an asset and a risk for Chad.

The struggle among world powers for influence in the Sahel is both an asset and a risk for Chad. President Déby used a trip to Moscow in January not only to send a strong signal to Paris, which immediately reaffirmed its security commitment to Chad, but also to play domestic politics. Aware of rising anti-French sentiment, he described his meeting with President Vladimir Putin as a ""historic act of sovereignty and independence"". Part of Chadian civil society welcomed these words, but also called on him to go further and join the Alliance of Sahel States, a bloc formed in September 2023 by the pro-Russian juntas of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, with which Déby maintains good relations. While for the moment the diversification of security partnerships has helped consolidate the regime through funding and military equipment, new fronts of instability could open. Divisions could emerge between pro-Russian and pro-Western regime elements, while the politico-military opposition could decide to seek support from either Moscow or Western capitals. In other words, the Chadian authorities' mixed messages vis-à-vis the anti-French sentiment in the country could backfire by making the country's alliances a source of domestic contention.

Chad's future beyond the 6 May election will depend on the measures taken to address these threats. Within Chad, social and political tensions are fuelled by the governance deficit that has plagued the country for decades. Young people in particular are demanding a more inclusive and equitable state. Organising legislative elections, the date of which has yet to be firmly set, will be the first major test for the president elected on 6 May. These elections' credibility will depend on them being held within a reasonable timeframe and according to the principles of transparency, notably with an audit of the voter roll. Such measures could be the first step toward re-establishing the rules of the democratic game in the country and laying the foundations for genuine national reconciliation. In the medium term, these efforts could also enable the new president to restore social confidence and break the cycle of violence linked to the inter-communal conflicts that are multiplying throughout the country, by involving local communities more in dispute resolution and strengthening the capacities of the security and judicial apparatus.

With so much turmoil in its vicinity, N'Djamena will have to adopt a cautious stance in the short term with regard to its positioning in the Sudanese conflict and its relations with Sahelian countries. If the new president decides to continue diversifying his security partners, he will have to lay his cards on the table and ensure coordination among the various players, such as French and Hungarian military personnel (and, possibly, Russians as well if the agreement between the two countries allows for it), particularly in training and supporting the army. Doing so will help avoid the rise of misinformation and inflammatory rhetoric in the country or, even worse, direct confrontation between its allies.",allafrica.com,news,allAfrica,,0.1215686274509804,452667319,1,https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,eng-9541697

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is keen to participate in Black Sea Cable project, if it proves feasible, ADB Director General for Central and Western Asia Eugenue Zhukov said in an exclusive interview with Trend on the sidelines of the ADB annual meeting in Tbilisi.

ADB director general noted that the Bank is a keen supporter of regional cooperation, because it is probably one of the few MDBs where the regional cooperation is mandated in its charter documents.

""In the case of Central Asia and Caucasus, in early 2000s we established Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC). Since that time, total investments in regional cooperation, including connectivity, have exceeded $50 billion. There is of course ongoing study on the Black Sea cable, going from Azerbaijan to Georgia, from Black Sea to Romania and the rest of the European Union. Feasibility study ongoing now. We hope that it is preliminary finished by mid or end of this year. So if the study demonstrates that the project is feasible, we are very keen to participate in that. I think it is a very large project and if it is going to happen, I think there will be room for many IFIs to participate. Then if we look to the east, indeed we saw that a few days ago in Tashkent, the governments of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan signed a preliminary MoU on the possible underwater cable crossing the Caspian Sea from Uzbekistan to Kazakhstan and to Azerbaijan on the so-called green energy corridor. Uzbekistan has been investing quite a lot to produce renewable energy, solar and wind, in the western parts of the country, while most of the economic base is actually in east of Uzbekistan. We think that these projects have potential to produce green energy, which then can be supplied for this proposed green corridor, but we believe that a lot of investments will be needed for this to happen,"" he said.

On December 17, 2022, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania, and Hungary signed a strategic partnership agreement that provides for the construction of an energy bridge from the Caucasus region to Europe.

As per the agreement, a 1,000 MW Black Sea Energy submarine electric cable spanning 1,195 kilometers is set to be constructed. The cable is intended to transmit 'green' electricity generated in Azerbaijan, routed through Georgia and the Black Sea to Romania, and further distributed to Hungary and the rest of Europe.

The Iberdrola group, a leading Spanish multinational electric utility company, inaugurated the plant, Europe's largest, in 2022. With around 1.5 million solar panels imported from China, the plant's clean energy output is substantial, catering to the needs of 334,000 households and creating over 1,500 jobs.

As exemplified by the Spanish PV plant, China's rapid progress in the renewable energy sector has played a pivotal role in advancing the European Union's (EU) green transition.

WIN-WIN GREEN COOPERATION

The European Green Deal, launched by the European Commission in 2019, targets net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To achieve this, the EU has pledged to increase the binding renewable energy share to at least 42.5 percent by 2030. However, with the current renewable energy share at approximately 23 percent, innovation is urgently needed.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, an association for the European solar PV sector, has warned that Europe must ramp up its solar deployment to meet the necessary targets, while WindEurope, a major wind energy association, also stressed the need for immediate action.

China's green energy equipment manufacturing industry is well-established and competitive. Chinese solar products and wind turbines would be indispensible for EU to achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets, said Qin Yan, a lead analyst at Refinitiv and researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

In fact, many European countries have reaped the benefits of green energy collaboration with China in recent years.

Pedro Amaral Jorge, president of the Portuguese Renewable Energy Association, highlighted the growing cooperation between China and Portugal in the solar energy sector, as Portugal aims to install approximately 8 gigawatts (GW) of solar power by 2026 or 2027 and reach 22 GW by 2030.

""To achieve the objectives set for increasing installed capacity, cooperation with China must increase,"" Jorge told Xinhua in an interview.

In Croatia, the Chinese-built Senj Wind Farm, inaugurated in December 2021, produces about 530 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green electricity each year and reduces Croatia's carbon dioxide emissions by about 460,000 tonnes per year.

""These are projects where the benefit of cooperation with large countries like China, which have the knowledge and potential to realize such large projects, can be seen,"" said Mladen Plese, Croatian political analyst and Asia expert, in an interview with Xinhua.

For Zlatko Prpic, chief engineer of the Senj Wind Farm, the project, the largest of its kind in Croatia so far, represents a ""miracle"" and a shining example of China-Croatia cooperation.

China's Norinco International, a civil engineering company, has been the main contractor and builder of the farm.

As Croatia and the EU ramp up their transition to green and renewable energy, it presents a significant opportunity for Norinco International and other Chinese firms to demonstrate their cutting-edge technology and equipment in large-scale projects, Prpic said.

BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR COOPERATION

The United Nations has urged countries to accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and infrastructure.

In the global drive towards a greener future, China assumes a pivotal role in facilitating the transition for both developed and developing nations, experts said.

""The future of Europe and the world hinges on them,"" said Plese, underlining the necessity for a united front transcending borders and political affiliations in combating climate change.

""China is developing technology and we need the cooperation of Chinese companies in that area as well,"" he said. ""Croatia has the potential for similar green energy projects and cooperation with China is still welcome.""

The 2021 report from the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU highlighted the impressive growth of China's PV cells and modules industry over the past decade. With affordable prices and significant economies of scale, Chinese enterprises emerge as the prime choice to complement the EU industrial chain, meeting the region's escalating demand for PV products.

The project involves the installation of 5,400 solar panels on the building's 10,000-square-meter steel roof. Under the Belgian regulations on the preservation of cultural heritage, the look and feel of the original building cannot be altered, so the design team at ESE customized a batch of special solar panels manufactured in China.

""It is a very good example of how to secure a listed building by using state-of-the-art architectural solutions,"" said Paul Thielemans, director of public relations at the Anderlecht Abattoir.

Climate change cooperation, which enjoys bright prospects, has emerged as a focal point in the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Europe.

In April, a delegation of climate envoys from the EU and member states including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark visited China and had productive discussions with their Chinese counterparts. Both sides were committed to intensifying climate dialogue and cooperation to bolster global climate governance.

Recent claims from some Western countries labeling China as having ""overcapacity"" lack substance and coherence. Upon closer examination, the following facts debunk such rhetoric and reveal the truth.

China's advanced production capacities in the new energy sector are in high demand globally, providing a diverse range of consumer products while serving as a pivotal player in the fight against climate change. Its competitive edge has been honed through diligent efforts and genuine expertise, rooted in market competition, innovation, and entrepreneurship. These strengths open up significant opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation.

Fallacy: China's new energy sector faces overcapacity.

Fact: China's burgeoning new energy sector stands as a beacon of technological prowess and a pivotal force in the global push for sustainable development. Contrary to prevailing notions of overcapacity, the critical deficit lies in the dearth of new energy infrastructure worldwide.

On a global scale, the shortfall in new energy capacity looms large. Projections from the International Energy Agency indicate a staggering demand surge, with new energy vehicle sales anticipated to soar to 45 million by 2030, a fourfold increase from 2022 levels. Last year's G20 Leaders' Declaration underscored the urgency, calling for a tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030.

China's new energy vehicle sector bears testament to this burgeoning demand, with both production and sales witnessing sustained and robust growth in recent years. In the first quarter, profits within China's automotive manufacturing sector surged by an impressive 32 percent year-on-year. Such performance underscores the dynamism of the nation's electric vehicle segment.

Fallacy: China's industrial policy twists global market.

Fact: China's utilization of industrial policies is characterized by equity, inclusivity, and strategic alignment. Across the globe, industrial policies serve as a staple tool to bolster specific sectors, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) permitting their implementation while mandating adherence to non-discriminatory principles.

China's ascendancy in the realm of new energy products is underpinned by a constellation of factors, heralding a competitive edge. Key among these are early investments in research and development, the establishment of a robust industrial ecosystem, access to a sprawling domestic market, the rapid evolution of infrastructure, and a vibrant marketplace teeming with competition across state-owned, private, and foreign enterprises, and rapid technological iterations.

The success narrative of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) epitomizes this trajectory, underscored by its pioneering technology and leading market position, forged through a relentless pursuit of innovation and strategic foresight. In 2023, CATL's commitment to research and development materialized in an investment totaling approximately 18.4 billion yuan (about $2.59 billion). Notably, the company has consistently maintained the industry's highest growth rate in patent applications.

In recent years, China has been substantially reducing subsidies within the new energy vehicle (NEV) sector. In stark contrast, nations like the United States, Britain, and France extend robust subsidy support for electric vehicles.

According to Liu Hongzhong, vice director of the China Society of World Economics, the landscape of industrial policies has undergone a notable shift since 2008, with developed nations rolling out a plethora of initiatives. However, many of these, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, bear the hallmarks of discriminatory practices, often wielded as geopolitical instruments under the guise of risk mitigation.

Critics argue that the United States has long been a global leader in the use of industrial policies and government subsides. Its extensive subsidies, coupled with clauses tinged with discrimination, contravene established market and international trade norms, thereby distorting the global industry chains. Notably, the U.S. is providing a staggering 52.7 billion U.S. dollars for semiconductor manufacturing subsidies and 369 billion dollars in tax incentives and subsidies for clean energy industries, including electric vehicles.

Fallacy: China's new energy products impact global economy.

Fact: China's export of new energy products has emerged as a crucial pillar supporting global economic expansion and price equilibrium. China's pivotal role in driving energy transitions, fostering economic growth, and enhancing livelihoods globally cannot be overstated.

Against a backdrop of sluggish global growth and heightened inflationary pressures in recent years, Chinese products have stood out for their hallmark attributes of quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. This has translated into tangible support for stabilizing global industrial and supply chains, effectively bolstering the availability of goods worldwide and mitigating inflationary strains.

Despite the competitive pricing of China's new energy exports, they fall within acceptable trade parameters and do not meet the technical definition of dumping. As exports increase, the prices of China's new energy vehicles also increase. Li Dawei, a researcher at the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, emphasized that these products maintain prices aligned with their inherent value, underscoring China's adherence to fair trade practices.

China's reach in the wind power and photovoltaic markets extends across more than 200 countries and regions, significantly driving down the global cost of clean energy adoption. Furthermore, collaborative endeavors in green energy ventures with over 100 nations have facilitated greater accessibility and affordability of local electricity supply.

China's advanced capacity contributes a lot to the world's economic development, greatly enriches the global supply and provides more choices for consumers.

Fallacy: China's new energy sector threatens jobs of other nations.

Fact: China's new energy sector is not just a source of domestic growth but also a catalyst for job creation globally, as firms extend their reach through overseas plant establishments and collaborative ventures. However, it is some other countries' protectionist policies, rather than such initiatives, that pose a threat to employment prospects.

Leveraging their technological prowess, Chinese new energy enterprises have intensified international collaborations, setting up production facilities in various countries such as Thailand, Hungary, and Germany, thereby generating thousands of employment opportunities. For instance, CATL, a leading battery manufacturer, commenced cell production at its inaugural overseas plant in Germany in December 2022, expected to create up to 2,000 new jobs locally. Moreover, with a substantial investment of 7.34 billion euros, CATL is in the process of constructing a production hub in Hungary.

The sharing of technology from CATL has also spurred job growth elsewhere, exemplified by U.S. automaker Ford's establishment of a factory in Michigan for manufacturing lithium iron phosphate batteries. This venture is anticipated to employ approximately 1,700 individuals.

Meanwhile, Chinese enterprises' overseas investments in clean energy encompass diverse domains like wind power, photovoltaic generation, and hydropower. In the first three quarters of 2023, Chinese firms committed an impressive $3.8 billion to overseas renewable energy projects, surpassing the combined sum of the preceding two years, according to a report issued at a forum on South-South cooperation in renewable energy held in late March. Such projects also mean tens of thousands of job opportunities as well as boosting the industrial development of partner countries.

However, the European Union's anti-subsidy measures, threatening punitive tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, have stirred apprehension. Hildegard Mueller, president of the Association of the Automotive Industry in Germany, cautioned that the potential trade conflict resulting from these measures may imperil German jobs reliant on business ties with China.

The world doesn't want less of China's capacity, but wants more funding and products to speed up energy transition and reduce poverty. Just as shown by the ongoing 2024 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition, China's new energy enterprises will advance innovation and develop more high-quality products and services to the world.",bjreview.com,news,BEIJING REVIEW,,0.1764705882352942,452652334,4,https://www.bjreview.com/Business/202404/W020240429380218150998.jpg,

After recent signs of progress, the outlook appears to dim as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to resist international pressure to halt the war. But Israeli media reports that CIA chief William Burns, a main mediator in the talks, will meet with Netanyahu on Monday. Israel has closed its main crossing point for delivering badly needed humanitarian aid for Gaza after Hamas militants attacked it and killed three soldiers. The defense minister warns of ""a powerful operation in the very near future in Rafah and other places across all of Gaza.""

Israel orders Al Jazeera to close its local operation and seizes some of its equipment

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Israel has ordered the local offices of Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite news network to close. The move Sunday escalates a long-running feud between the broadcaster and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government as Doha-mediated cease-fire negotiations with Hamas hang in the balance. Al Jazeera went off Israel's main satellite and cable providers in the hours after the order. However, its website and multiple online streaming links still operated Sunday. The network has reported the Israeli-Hamas war nonstop since the militants' initial cross-border attack Oct. 7 and has maintained 24-hour coverage in the Gaza Strip amid Israel's grinding ground offensive that has killed and wounded members of its own staff.

Denial and uncertainty are looming over a Biden-Trump rematch 6 months out from Election Day

WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- It's six months before Election Day, and Joe Biden and Donald Trump are locked in a presidential rematch. The race is highly in flux as many voters are only just beginning to embrace the reality of the 2024 contest. Wars, trials, the independent candidacy of Robert Kennedy Jr. and deep divisions across America have created much uncertainty. At the same time, domestic policy fights over abortion, immigration and the economy are raging. On top of that, public polling consistently shows that voters don't like their election year options. But whether voters want to believe it or not, the general election matchup is all but set.

What a judge's gag order on Trump means in his hush money case

NEW YORK (AP) -- Virtually every day of his hush money criminal trial, Donald Trump talks about how he can't talk about it. He's told reporters outside the courtroom that a gag order in the case is ""totally unconstitutional"" and ""a disgrace."" The order bars him from making out-of-court, public comments on witnesses, jurors and some others connected to the case. The judge found that Trump repeatedly violated the order and he fined Trump $9,000. The judge also warned that jail could follow if Trump keeps it up. The order doesn't stop Trump from talking about the allegations against him or commenting on the judge or the elected top prosecutor. And it doesn't stop him from testifying in court if he chooses.

A Holocaust survivor will mark that history differently after the horrors of Oct. 7

KIBBUTZ MEFALSIM, Israel (AP) -- Israel will start marking Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday evening. But this year, after the unprecedented Oct. 7 attack by the militant Hamas group, the somber commemoration carries a heavier weight than usual for many Holocaust survivors. Judith Tzamir is a Holocaust survivor from Germany now living in Israel, and she will join 55 other survivors for a memorial march in Poland, called March of the Living. The event recreates the 2-mile march from Auschwitz to Birkenau death camps. The event usually draws Holocaust survivors, Jewish participants, students, leaders and politicians from Israel and around the world. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also march.

Biden has rebuilt the refugee system after Trump-era cuts. What comes next in an election year?

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The American refugee program long served as a haven for people fleeing violence around the world. Today, it's rebounding from dwindling arrivals under the Trump administration. President Joe Biden's administration has worked to streamline the process of screening and placing people in America, and resettlement agencies have opened more sites around the country.

Floods in southern Brazil kill at least 75 people over 7 days, with 103 people missing

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- Authorities say massive floods in Brazil's southern Rio Grande do Sul state have killed at least 75 people over the last seven days and another 103 are reported missing. Damage from the rains has forced more than 80,000 people from their homes. Approximately 15,000 have taken refuge in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters. Landslides, flooded roads and collapsed bridges have left devastation in their are leaving a wake of devastation in the state. Operators reported electricity and communications cuts. More than 800,000 people are without water supply, according to the civil defense agency.

China's president arrives in Europe to reinvigorate ties at a time of global tensions

PARIS (AP) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping is kicking off a three-country trip to Europe with the continent divided over how to deal with Beijing's growing power and the U.S.-China rivalry. European carmakers are losing ground to subsidized Chinese electric vehicles. Diplomats fret about alleged Chinese spies in European capitals. And China's continued defense trade with Russia worries anyone in Europe who supports war-ravaged Ukraine and fears that the Russian army won't stop there. But Europe and China have hefty economic ties and Xi appears determined to rebuild and deepen relations with European leaders. Xi starts Sunday in France, then heads to Serbia and Hungary.

Methodists end anti-gay bans, closing 50 years of battles over sexuality for mainline Protestants

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- When the United Methodist Church removed anti-gay language from its official rules last week, it marked the end of a half-century of debates over LGBTQ inclusion in America's mainline Protestant denominations. The moves sparked joy from progressive delegates, but the church faces many of the same challenges as the Lutheran, Presbyterian and Episcopal denominations that took similar routes over the past few decades. There have been schisms, and strained relations with international churches. And each of the mainline denominations faces the long-term aging and shrinking of their memberships.

This enabled Texas by itself to provide a natural gas lifeline to Europe after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine destabilized energy markets, in part due to a near ten percent decline in Russian oil and gas production.

The U.S. could then export significant gas supplies because the U.S. produces 13.3 million barrels a day of crude oil, and 17 million barrels a day of crude oil and condensates, the highest ever, a result in large part due to the new technology of fracking.

The benefits of ""drill, baby, drill"" are clear. The U.S. in 2023 annually produced 180 million more barrels of oil than the previous 2019 peak. However, with growth in population of 15 million people, and GDP growth of $5.1 trillion, and oil supplies up only 3.6%, oil prices still shot up.

Despite increased U.S. production, sanctions on Russian did initially take oil off the market. But the other reason why oil prices have also shot up by 50% despite increased U.S. supply is that since 2021 there have been 200 executive actions taken by the U.S. government to preclude further enhanced coal, oil and gas production, largely as part of a policy of getting to zero net greenhouse gases by 2035.

And this occurred even though the U.S. already cut back significantly on green-house gas emissions. For example, gas production in the Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico has surged 345% while methane emissions have been already cut 76%. Fully meeting methane emission goals in the area would fulfill the reductions needed to meet the overall requirement for keeping global temperatures low, including for example, Exxon's plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.

The pursuit of lower fossil fuel production in the U.S. impedes Ukraine's war effort. Since 2021, West Texas U.S. crude oil prices climbed from $60/b to $83/b to where they are today. Pump prices also surged to over $3.50 a gallon on average, nearly a 50% increase compared to 2019.

This, in turn, was a key part of the nearly 20% increase in the cost of essentials since 2021, which also led to the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, to where an average mortgage now requires a 7% loan rate rather than 3% in 2021.

Why would the U.S. government not seek to keep oil and gas production high and inflation low, particularly with a national election coming up where inflation and the cost of living are high on the concern of many Americans? With lower energy prices, Americans might be more willing to help Ukraine even as the country seeks a sound energy policy consistent with both environmental standards and robust economic growth.

However, even more importantly, a sound U.S. energy strategy could help the U.S. win the war against Russia and simultaneously place Ukraine at the center of a new invigorated energy policy (1) transforming Ukraine into an independent energy gas station for all of Europe and (2) eliminating the leverage Mocow seeks in enhancing Europe's dependence on energy supplies from Russia, most notably natural gas to Germany.

The strategic situation is Europe involves more than Ukraine. Much evidence has recently appeared confirming that beyond its aggression against Ukraine Russia is waging war against Europe as a whole. Apart from military operations in Ukraine, many NATO members now warn about Russian military attacks against other European states within 3-5 years. On top of Russian military attacks massive Russian information and espionage operations against Europe are occurring regularly.

However, the bedrock instrument of Russian policy for the last generation has been its energy penetration of Europe that provides the financial basis for its other operations and in many cases leads directly into the political-economic subversion of governments from Germany, Italy, and Austria through the Balkans into Belarus and Ukraine.

One major example of the process whereby dependence upon Russian energy translates into Russian political warfare is Moldova. Lacking its own indigenous energy sources and having already been victimized in 1992 by Moscow's seizure of its province Transnistria (the land beyond the Dniester River), Moldova has been the target of repeated Russian efforts to destroy its sovereignty and integrity for over 30 years.

Indeed, in 2023 Russia apparently planned a coup there just as it tried to attack it in 2014 during the seizure of Crimea. In all of Moscow's pressure against Moldova it has taken that state's energy dependence upon Russia as the point of departure for all of its probes and as a basis for financing these operations.

Balkan coups led by Russian agents either in Russia or in countries like Transnistria are a regular tactic of the Russian government. Russia instigated coups in Macedonia, Montenegro in 2015-16 and evidently attempted to stage another coup in Bulgaria in 2016 using the extensive influence it has gained there. Outgoing Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov has just commented that we should ""expect Russia to do 'whatever possible'"" to preserve its influence here.

Here too Russian leverage begins with energy. In Bulgaria, leaked documents have repeatedly confirmed Russia's concealed control over the Turk Stream pipeline bringing Russian gas from Türkiye to Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary. As the Center for the Study of Democracy in Bulgaria reported in 2020, also on the basis of leaked corporate documents, since 2019, before construction of this pipeline began, Russia was using Saudi, Belarussian and European companies to evade U.S. sanctions against the Turk Stream pipeline. Consequently, Russia ships the gas, builds the pipeline, and finances it through proxy entities.

The proper response to this war on Europe must go beyond the resolute, regular, consistent, and decisive provision of the weaponry Ukraine needs to win, i.e., restore its integrity and realize its full sovereignty. Whether Ukraine can achieve these objectives has come under serious question recently, but however the outcome the U.S. and its allies' strategy must also comprise a permanent reduction of European energy dependence upon Russia, an objective fully within the U.S. capability.

Both these replies to Moscow are not only feasible but also must necessarily form parts of a coherent strategy, something to which the Biden Administration seems to be allergic or at least unable to put forward. For example, Moldova's ability to ward off Russian pressures begins with ridding itself of Russian energy leverage. To the degree that it has currently done so it has utilized foreign energy sources and EU subsidies. This is clearly inadequate for the long term. But there are viable alternatives that can be brought into play for Moldova and for much if not all of the Balkans.

The pipelines bringing Russian gas to Moldova traverse Ukraine in conformity with long-standing agreements between Moscow and Kyiv. However, since Europe is scheduled to eliminate all Russian gas by 2027, including LNG, and stocks for 2025 are already abundant, Ukraine now feels it can safely terminate its contract with Gazprom to bring oil to the Balkans and Eastern Europe through pipelines located in Ukraine. Ukraine, despite the war, has been on and off exporting electricity to states like Romania since the war began and the advent of peace could certainly see a regeneration of those exports. Moreover, should its energy capabilities be restored it can then utilize the existing pipeline infrastructure to export considerable amounts of hydrocarbons or other energy sources to the Balkans. Such visions may seem far-fetched or even utopian when Russia is now pulverizing whatever it can of Ukraine's energy sector, in the context of Ukraine's necessary strikes on Russian oil refineries.

Nevertheless, those strikes also reflect Russia's growing alarm that its own energy sector is being targeted and at risk of being excluded from its natural historical market, Europe. Indeed, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov now complains that the West wants to defeat Russia to oust it from energy markets, showing Russia's concerns about being supplanted by a revived Ukraine.

These factors duly suggest the requisite course of action to negate Russia's aerial power and offensive while also strengthening Moldova and other Balkan countries and reducing Russia's energy presence in the Balkans. In the military domain transferring the air defense capabilities to Ukraine that enable it to negate Russian attacks on its energy and electrical infrastructure and armed forces will not only diminish the likelihood of a successful Russian ground and air offensive but also rehabilitate that infrastructure and spur energy production.

Providing these capabilities would also enhance Kyiv's threat to Crimea and the Russian energy facilities that Russia illegally seized there in 2014. Ukraine can also use the respite provided by these weapons to begin delivering energy to Moldova or Romania and throughout the Balkans. By transferring weapons to Ukraine that it desperately needs (now that the assistance package has passed the House of Representatives), Ukraine can relatively quickly address its requirements and those of the Balkans to enhance stability and security while also defeating Russia's political warfare in the Balkans.

While these moves are being made and before their impact makes itself felt in Ukraine and the Balkans; we need to continue to ensure the ongoing supply of energy to states like Moldova, using American energy. U.S. gas supplies are the biggest in the world, and continued exports of LNG remain a critical ingredient to help reformulate U.S. security policy, which should start with a reversal of the administration's ban on new permit for LNG exports.

At the same time we should be employing all the means of power at our disposal to create a new energy order for Europe to promote the long-term diversification of energy suppliers to Europe and the concurrent revival of energy infrastructure and connectivity promised by programs like the Three Seas Initiative. This program is ideally suited to undertake the long-term economic and energy integration of all of Eastern Europe, including the Balkans and Ukraine among others, by fostering new means of connectivity and new infrastructure, prominently including energy pipelines from the Baltic to the Black Sea. But it requires strong diplomatic and economic support to move forward. Otherwise, it will fail to realize its potential and we will lose a strong instrument that can help build a stabler, more secure, and enduring European order.

China and India are growing greenhouse gas emissions (1.3 b/tons) from 2020-2 that exceed by 120% what the U.S. eliminated between 20007-2022 (1 b/tons) by a factor of 130%. And in Europe, with gas and coal declining markedly after an initial increase at the time of the Ukraine war, and despite a 19% record drop in GHG emissions, failure to have sufficient substitutes for Russian natural gas has seen wood and biomass burning increase in Europe where it is now 60% of ""renewables."" On the other hand, U.S. energy production especially oil and natural gas, can make the U.S. the swing world producer and markedly reduce the leverage of both OPEC and Russia.

Certainly, if such an initiative recovers its momentum, it will provide a basis for expanding Ukraine's energy ties, including Ukrainian energy exports of fossil fuels, electricity, nuclear power, and green energy to all of its neighbors, including Moldova. In that event we will have taken a major step, utilizing our military assistance, energy capabilities, and diplomatic strategy towards providing and executing a well-conceived and truly strategic conception to strengthen Ukraine, undermine Russian economic and military capabilities, and intensify European integration.

All three of those outcomes contribute materially to the long-standing American interest in what President George H.W. Bush memorably called a Europe whole and free.

Moreover, all these actions are now easily within our reach. What is needed is decisive strategic leadership to act according to this strategic plan. Russia's aggression against Ukraine represents not only a crisis but a once in a generation opportunity to advance vital American interests for which we fought three wars (including the Cold War), and we can do so with peaceful means. For too long we have acted without a strategy for victory, and if we continue to squander this opportunity neither history nor future generations will forgive us.

Now the other part of the story is that our ally Ukraine wants to curtail Russian, not U.S., oil, and gas production to impede Russia's war machine. But some within the Administration are pushing Ukraine not to attack Russian refineries. Apparently, the administration believes if Russian oil and gas supply are harmed, energy prices would rise even higher to say nothing of whether such attacks on Russian soil would trigger Putin's often threatened escalation to the use of nuclear weapons.

Ironically, despite sanctions, Russia surprisingly produces 10.7mb/d of crude today, very close to the production in 2022 of 11.3mb/d. With prices 50% higher, however, Russian revenue is $7 billion a month higher or annually $84 billion higher than in 2021. This enables Moscow to better fund the war against Ukraine.

Therefore, if the U.S. wants to defeat the Russians and secure a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine territory, a key strategy (as President Reagan implemented) must certainly include curtailing Russian energy production, as nearly two-thirds of revenue to the Russian government comes from oil and gas sales.

Russian oil production at the time of the 2022 invasion was 11.3 million barrels a day while the EIA projects Russian production for all of 2024 will remain at 10.7 million barrels a day, the third largest in the world. Energy sanctions apparently have not done enough to deter Russia because they do not yet appear to be effective. This is also because Russia has reoriented its sales to China, Turkye and India, while evading sanctions by using unregistered and uninsured tankers for transport, dropping exports to Europe from 20 million cubic meters per month to 4 million.

Sanctions were designed to punish Russia and keep its energy revenue down, but pushing Ukraine not to attack Russian oil refineries moves in the opposite direction, keeping Russian oil and gas production and supply as well as revenues high. At the same time, the U.S. Administration is also spending hundreds of billions to keep U.S. reliable fossil fuel production down but more unreliable renewable energy production up.

One of President Reagan's key measures was to dramatically increase U.S. (and Saudi) oil production to significantly lower the prices of oil and gas and literally take away multiple tens of billions of dollars from the Soviet exchequer.

At the time, oil and gas exports were the most important source of foreign exchange for the entire Soviet government, along with arms sales. Lowering oil prices from today's $83-7/barrel to even $60 would substantially cut Moscow's revenue.

The U.S. has the resources to increase the world-wide oil and gas supply significantly, even if Russian domestic energy production were curtailed by Ukraine attacks. Thus, both U.S. energy policy and U.S. Ukraine war strategy illustrate how an all of government approach requires the left and right hand to work in sync rather in contradiction to each other.

However, one views global climate change and the role of fossil fuel production, you cannot reduce access to U.S. energy sources from where currently 60% of all electricity comes and expect prices not to stimulate inflation and then interest rates with a deleterious impact on the U.S. economy. This, in turn, makes it more difficult for Congress to appropriate billions to support Ukraine's defense. On top of which, natural gas can substitute for call and improve the environment simultaneously.

As Robert Zubrin wrote many years ago, from 1974 through 2008, every major spike in U.S. oil prices has been followed by a recession in the United States. For the U.S. with a $34 trillion debt now that is accumulating at $1 trillion every 90-100 days, bringing inflation down and interest rates as well is important. The U.S. in 2023 paid more in interest payments on the debt than we spent for the entire U.S. Department of Defense. To prevent further economic erosion, the U.S. must increase its own oil and gas production if simultaneously the U.S. wants to curtail Russian production as a deterrent strategy against Russia.

However, when the United States pushes against Ukraine attacks against Russian energy facilities, a key part of Ukraine toolbox is taken away, allowing Russian domestic production, and refining as well as exports of oil and gas to continue. Although not exporting as much to Europe compared to 2022, Russia exports more oil and gas now to India, China, and Türkiye, all of whom have pushed aside sanctions against purchasing Russian energy, while the previous assumptions of declining tanker availability have also not been borne out.

One recent report concludes ""Russia, along with other countries not participating in sanctions, have established shipping services designed to avoid G7 sanctions and price caps, leading to more export outlets being available to Russia.... we expect Russia's production to average 10.7 million b/d in 2023 and remain mostly unchanged in 2024.""

Whatever the U.S. thought sanctions would do to help the war to stop Russian aggression, our energy policy has left Russian oil and gas production only marginally reduced (1.3mb/d vs. 10.7 mb/d) and generated U.S. inflation at over 20% since 2021. This is not a sound policy and needs to be overhauled.

Within the European Union, Hungarian residents had to pay the least for electricity at the end of last year, and the country fared similarly well when it comes to the price of gas, too.

As per the latest Eurostat report, the price of electricity and the cost of gas in the EU started to rise just before the Ukraine war and reached a massive peak in 2022. Costs began to fall in the second half of 2023, as the price of supplying energy managed to stabilise at the beginning of the year.

At the same time, when compared to tariffs prior to the climax in 2022, the costs of energy, supply, and network are still relatively high.

Residential electricity prices fell between 2022 and 2023 in 23 European Union member states. The average household electricity price in the region was EUR 28.5/100 kWh in the second half of 2023, down from EUR 29.4/100 kWh in the first half.

Gas prices showed a similar trend in some countries in the region, mainly due to lower energy costs and cuts in taxes. 12 countries reported price increases, while the other 12 countries using gas reported price decreases. The average household gas price fell to EUR 11.3/100 kWh in the second half of 2023, down from EUR 11.9/100 kWh in the previous six months.

In Poland, prices were 32 percent higher, in Slovakia and Germany 22 percent higher, while Greece, Denmark, and Bulgaria saw the largest price decreases, around 40 percent reduction in the case of each country. In the industrial sector, all but three countries reported decreases, indicating a clear downward trend in gas prices.

Eurostat highlights that Hungary had the lowest average household electricity prices with EUR 11.3/100 kWh in the second half of 2023. The second lowest price of electricity was in Bulgaria (EUR 11.9), and the third lowest in Malta (EUR 12.8).

Whereas, the price of electricity was highest in Germany (EUR 40.2/100 kWh), Ireland (EUR 37.9), and Belgium (EUR 37.8).

Hungary had the lowest average price of household gas (EUR 3.3/100 kWh) in the first half of 2023. Hungary was followed by Croatia with EUR 4.6/100 kWh and Romania with EUR 5.6/100 kWh.

Or follow us on Google News!

The carbon neutral goal is an elusive one, but progress has been reported in some unexpected spots. One of those is the European nation of Cyprus, which was hovering around rock bottom for renewable energy just a few years ago. Now the country has been picking up steam. In the latest development, Cyprus is trialing a new large scale, long duration compressed air energy storage system that leverages the water pressure of the ocean for maximum effectiveness.

Among European nations, Iceland hit the 100% renewable energy target all the way back in 2015. However, since Iceland is not a member of the European Union, the race to be the first EU nation to ditch fossil fuels from the power generation landscape is still wide open.

For a while there it looked like Cyprus was almost ready to give up the ghost. Nevertheless, on February 24 the Guardian took note of renewable energy progress in the EU, listing Cyprus among the nations reporting big gains.

There is still a long way to go, as the Guardian puts it. A rundown of the data from 2022 shows EU electricity consumption averaging about 41% from renewable resources, with Sweden and Denmark leading the pack at 83.3% and 77.2% respectively. Down at the bottom were Malta (10.1%), Hungary (15.3%), the Czech Republic (15.5%), and Luxembourg (15.9%), with Cyprus easing ahead of the bottom-dwellers at 18%.

A healthy dose of long duration energy storage would help nations like Cyprus climb the renewable energy ladder more quickly. Unlike lithium-ion battery systems that typically last about 4-6 hours, a long duration energy storage system can produce clean kilowatts for longer periods, lasting up to full days, weeks, or even seasons. At that level, intermittent sources -- namely, wind and solar energy -- could provide for nuclear-style stability, continuity, and reliability at a fraction of the cost of a new nuclear power plant.

The long duration energy storage field has been attracting furious activity on the part of investors and innovators, with some of the latest activity focusing on new long duration technologies that deploy the physics of heat transfer.

The natural systems of the Earth are also rich territory for long duration innovators. Pumped hydropower, for example, has been getting a second look in recent years. This decades-old, mature technology is a perfect fit for wind and solar power. It relies on the force of gravity to shunt water from an upper reservoir to a lower generating station. Ideally, the upper reservoir is refilled only when excess renewable energy is available to run the pumps (see our long duration archive here).

Compressed air is another long duration technology that has been getting a workout in the 2000s. Some of the earlier compressed air attempts have fallen by the wayside, but new iterations keep popping up.

Compressed air systems can leverage underground rock formations or human-made structures as storage platforms, though each has drawbacks. In underground storage the containerization is durable and readymade, and there is less potential conflict with land use on the surface. However, rock formations are geo-specific. Human-made platforms can potentially cover a much wider range of site options, but they are expensive and can run into roadblocks from competing land uses.

One solution that has crossed the CleanTechnica radar is underwater storage. Back in 2022 we took note of a bladder-based energy storage system that is sort of an underwater version of pumped hydro, leveraging water pressure instead of gravity.

Another take on deploying water pressure for energy storage comes from the Israeli startup BaroMar, which has come up with a simple sounding tank-based compressed air system. The system is designed for use at coastal areas and islands adjacent to deep water. The plan is to locate the tanks in depths of around 500 feet, where the water pressure is sufficient and conflicts with marine life are less in evidence.

""The hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water enables construction of long-lasting large tanks at very low cost,"" BaroMar explains. Also assisting on the cost-cutting end of things is a design strategy focusing on eliminating underwater moving parts and subsystems. The tanks are constructed on shore, using marine-proven concrete and steel, then towed into place.

That sounds simple enough, though the devil is in the details. Earlier this week, the engineering firm Jacobs let word slip that it BaroMar selected it to produce the preliminary design for the Cyprus project, billed as a ""first-of-its-kind underwater large-scale, long-duration energy storage pilot project.""

Jacobs observes that BaroMar's energy storage solution deploys mature technologies in the fields of power, energy, and marine engineering. However, combining them with the hydrostatic pressure of seawater is a delicate act.

""This project requires extensive geophysical, geotechnical and bathymetric surveying, investigation, feasibility studying and permitting for tank installation at deep depths for onshore mechanical and electrical equipment needs,"" explained Jacobs Vice President Fiachra Ó Cléirigh.

As described by Jacobs, the Cyprus project will consist of large, rigid tanks ballasted on the seabed with a combined capacity of 4 megawatt-hours.

""The tanks are designed to resist loads imposed by the marine environment as well as the compressed air and hydrostatic water pressure, during both installation and operational conditions,"" Jacobs adds.

Excess electricity from wind and solar resources will be shunted by subsea cable to the tanks, where it feeds compressors. When more electricity is needed, the compressed air is fed back to land where it is expanded and fed into a generator.

Last September the nonprofit organization ISRAEL21c interviewed BaroMar founder Yonadav Buber, who explained that undersea tanks are less expensive to construct because the pressure of seawater acts as a stabilizer. Though site selection is limited to coasts and islands, these same locations are notoriously crowded. Opportunities for large scale, land-based energy storage are difficult to find.

""This is a really genius solution, because it circumvents the problem in a very elegant way. It also creates the possibility of more or less endless energy storage, because we're talking about the seabed, which is not exactly hot real estate,"" Buber told ISRAEL21c writer Naama Barak.

Buber emphasized that the technology components are mature and are not in need of extensive development, unlike some of the other new long duration energy storage technologies emerging today. He noted that marine-related regulatory and engineering requirements are the main challenges that lie between the pilot project and commercial deployment.

When Buber spoke to ISRAEL21c last fall, he indicated that Cyprus meets the three main client categories targeted by BaroMar. One consists of renewable energy producers with surpluses on hand, and the second consists of large scale energy consumers including port facilities and other large industrial complexes.

""And our third type of customer is governments,"" Buber added. ""We're in discussions, for example, with the government of Cyprus, to make them the first member state of the European Union to run on 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.""

Whether or not that ambitious goal is possible remains to be seen. However, in February our friends over at PV Magazine reported that Cyprus already expects to curtail a good 28% of its renewable energy production in 2024, so it clearly has a hefty surplus on hand.

PV Magazine cited a lack of energy storage facilities and the absence of sufficient interconnections with other countries as the main drivers of renewable energy overproduction in Cyprus.

If you're thinking green hydrogen could help soak up some of those excess clean kilowatts, Cyprus is one step ahead of you. In 2022 Cyprus earned the title of ""laggard"" in a rundown of EU national hydrogen strategies, but the very next year a consortium of 27 nations organized to tap Cyprus to host the EU's first ""Hydrogen Valley"" in Cyprus. We'll be keeping an eye out for next steps but so far the focus is on green hydrogen sourced from water, leveraging power from renewable resources.

Undoubtedly, Moscow was displeased with the high-level April 4 trilateral meeting in Brussels, where Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan held talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, EU High Representative Josep Borrell, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power. And the fact that it coincided with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) 75th anniversary celebrations surely intensified the Kremlin's frustration. Baku's reaction before and after the meeting mirrored that of Moscow's. Despite receiving dual assurances in phone calls from Brussels and Washington a day prior, Azerbaijan contended that its exclusion from the US-EU-Armenia talks would hinder the Azerbaijani-Armenian peace process. Unofficial government-linked media went as far as suggesting that the trilateral meeting transcended political and economic cooperation, alleging that the West was readying military support to Armenia. Iran, another influential player in the South Caucasus, expressed its own, albeit less overtly critical, dissatisfaction, asserting that regional matters should be resolved within the framework of the 3+3 format (comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Iran, and Turkey). Though, should Azerbaijan's assertions regarding military collaboration materialize, Iran's opposition to Western involvement in the region will likely harden.

Deteriorating Russian-Armenian ties

The EU and US officials' sit-down with Pashinyan reciprocated the Armenian government's noteworthy shift toward the West in recent months. That apparent Armenian reorientation dates back at least to the 2020 Second Karabakh War, which ended with Azerbaijan's victory over Armenian forces but during which time Russia -- Armenia's primary strategic ally -- remained ostensibly neutral and did not militarily intervene. Moreover, when the Azerbaijani army seized a number of key positions within Armenia's sovereign territory a year later and then regained control of the majority of the Armenian-populated territories located within the remaining parts of Karabakh in 2023, Russia also did not lift a finger. Moscow's failure to act resulted in a deterioration of its relations with Yerevan. As one of the first major steps, Armenia declared a freeze on its participation in the Moscow-led regional alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). More recently, Armenian leaders have called for the withdrawal of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) border guard forces from Yerevan's Zvartnots airport. One ruling party parliamentarian went even further, implying that the Russian military base in Gyumri should be closed ""when time comes.""

Though its Russian ally's disengagement was a major factor in Armenia's shift toward the West, so were the series of recent Georgian advancements toward EU membership. On Dec. 14, 2023, the European Council officially granted candidate status to Georgia. Observing Georgia's complicated yet incremental movement along the path of European integration, the Armenian leadership chose to follow suit, emphasizing shared values with the West and expressing an openness to aligning more closely with its South Caucasus neighbors.

Strategic importance of the South Caucasus

The EU-US-Armenia trilateral meeting must also be considered in the context of the South Caucasus as a strategic transregional corridor. Notably, in addition to providing Armenia with 270 million euros in grants, the Western partners in Brussels pledged that Armenia would play a crucial role in the Black Sea Submarine Cable Project, scheduled to become operational in 2029. This 3-gigawatt, high-voltage electricity transmission line is a key element of the EU's broader Global Gateway Initiative, aimed in part at countering China's Belt and Road Initiative. The project's launch, in December 2022, was attended by leaders from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania, and Hungary, initially focusing on linking the electricity systems of these countries.

Once operational, the submarine electricity cable will certainly contribute to much-needed diversification of Armenia's energy supply. But Yerevan must also take some serious short-term steps to reduce its dependence on Russia. Unlike Georgia, Armenia has been unable to import natural gas Azerbaijan due to the multi-decade conflict between two countries. Consequently, this has led to Armenia's increasing reliance on Russia not only in terms of gas imports but also because it has progressively granted Russian Gazprom ever greater control over the country's domestic pipeline infrastructure as payment in kind for its mounting debts. Today, Russia fully owns Armenia's domestic natural gas infrastructure, including the transportation and distribution networks. A successful completion of peace talks with Azerbaijan could offer an opening for Armenia to be able to diversify away from Russian gas by finally being able to purchase volumes from its eastern neighbor.

Armenia also relies on Russian nuclear technology for 25% of its power generation from Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant. According to recent reports, Armenia and Russia agreed to modernize the existing Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant to extend its lifespan until 2036; though the two sides are also exploring the possibility of building a new Rosatom-designed VVR 1200 reactor unit at this facility or elsewhere. Due to safety concerns, Metsamor's continued operation has long been a bone of contention between Yerevan and the EU. One alternative is partnering with French or American companies to build smaller, modular reactors. The recent trilateral meeting may contribute to the realization of the latter.

Challenges ahead in escaping Russia's orbit

Clearly, Armenia will not find it easy to substantially reduce its ties to Russia. As noted above, the country is overwhelmingly reliant on Russian energy. Moreover, Russian state-owned companies continue to dominate the Armenian economy, and the country formally remains a member of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). Furthermore, heated political rhetoric aside, the lease on Russia's military base in Armenia does not expire until 2044, Russian FSB agents are present on Armenia's borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan, and Armenia remains a treaty member of the CSTO.",mei.edu,news,Middle East Institute,,0.04313725490196085,452617158,7,https://www.mei.edu/sites/default/files/2024-05/Armenia-EU-US%20meeting%2C%20April%202024%20-%20cropped.jpg,eng-9541995

""Sharing Memories"" is Meta's annual Holocaust Remembrance Day project in Israel, and its main goal is to connect the younger generation to the testimonies of Holocaust survivors and raise awareness of their financial situation.

Every year, about 20 celebrities and content creators, with hundreds of thousands of followers, participate in the project, meeting with survivors and recording their testimonies. The videos of these meetings are then shared as reels on Instagram, helping creators connect their young audiences to the stories of the survivors.

In the project, which the Latet organization also takes part in, several celebrities have participated, including dancer Anna Aronov, singer/songwriter Odeya Azulay, actress/singer Ania Bukstein, dancer/actress Dana Frieder, actress/singer Meshi Kleinstein, American actor and comedian Michael Rapaport, pastry chef Or Shpitz and actor/comedian Orel Tsabari.

'These two holocausts are totally different since I know everyone in Be'eri'

Haim Ra'anan, 89

It took them 20 hours, beginning at 6:30 a.m. on that terrible Shabbat, to be evacuated from the kibbutz. Haim Ra'anan, an 89-year-old Holocaust survivor, hid in the shelter in his house in Kibbutz Be'eri with his caregiver, son and grandson.

They could not leave the shelter or utter a sound, as the rumors that reached them via WhatsApp were horrifying: Terrorists had raided the kibbutz, invaded homes, murdered and kidnapped their friends.

It also took a long time for the evacuation to take place. ""The soldiers put me in a wheelchair and started taking me out,"" he says. ""Walking 300 or 400 meters to the kibbutz gate took us an hour and a half.

""As we evacuated, we heard the shooting and saw the explosions and burning apartments, but you didn't even think about it because you were still in survival mode. We crossed the street where my grandchildren live.

""When I passed the homes of my grandchildren, I asked the soldiers if they had already evacuated these homes and what had happened to them. Actually, it was only when I got onto the bus that I realized they were fine. I can't express how fortunate I am. Next door to my granddaughter's apartment, a father and his baby were murdered by gunfire,"" Ra'anan says.

""My home wasn't invaded by terrorists, but terrorists attempted and even succeeded in invading the houses of all my grandchildren. Fortunately, they are all safe. The house of one of my granddaughters was set on fire, but they escaped through a window to another neighbor's apartment. It was a miracle.""

Wallenberg -- then and now

Ra'anan was born in Hungary in 1935, and when WWII began, his father was in Israel making preparations for his family's aliyah. ""For the entire period of my childhood, the one I actually never had, I grew up without my father,"" he says.

Since he was a child during those dark war days, he does not remember much of them. ""The only picture I have from that time is of my mother and me in the Jewish ghetto, with a yellow badge on our clothes.""\

He only remembers how they were saved with the help of certificates issued for them by Raoul Wallenberg, the Righteous Among the Nations. ""They helped us get out of the ghetto and move to another area of Budapest. Thanks to them, we survived.""

Ra'anan is currently living in a sheltered housing complex located on Raoul Wallenberg Street in Tel Aviv.

Today, he has 19 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. During the Holocaust, he was the same age as one of his grandchildren with whom he locked himself in the shelter on Oct. 7. In spite the many parallels, Ra'anan sees a clear distinction between the experiences:

""These two holocausts are entirely different stories for me. The six million feel differently than my kibbutz's 200 residents who were murdered, kidnapped or injured. I knew everyone in Be'eri.""

""My real holocaust was when my grandson was kidnapped""

Tzili Wenkert, 83

""When Hamas kidnapped Omer, my grandson, all of my pain suddenly burst open. He is such a gorgeous boy, so cute and so kind. I feel as if someone has smashed me with a big hammer. This is the real holocaust,"" says Tzili Wenkert, 83, a Shoah survivor.

""My adorable, kindhearted grandson is a hard worker and a student - what has he done?"", she continues in deep sorrow. ""He is not in good health, he suffers from colitis, a condition that requires medication. There is no way of knowing whether the medication that was sent reached him. No one knows anything.""

When Wenkert was six weeks old, in August 1941, she was taken to a small room in the ghetto with her parents, where they lived for three and a half years with her grandfather, grandmother and two aunts.

""We lived in very poor conditions. Due to the cold winter and the lack of electricity, the family had to sell its belongings to buy food and wood. I remember the Nazis bombarding the ghetto and many people dying from the attacks, hunger, diseases and the freezing temperatures.""

Even with poverty, hunger and constant worry, her family tried to hold Shabbat dinners and even sometimes bought an emaciated chicken for everyone. Wenkert's mother knew how to sew. She made her children's clothes from her grandfather's shirt, and boots out of his hat.

As a child, Wenkert became ill with dysentery, but there were no medicines and no physicians in the ghetto. ""My grandmother did things that grandmothers do, and she saved me. I was unable to walk, but I survived and recovered.""

Torn to pieces

After the war, Wenkert and her family returned to her father's hometown. In addition to the hardships and poverty of that time, she remembers getting a little sister while being three and a half years old. ""We rented a small apartment with no electricity and applied to make aliyah to Israel.""

However, the communist regime in Romania prevented her family from moving to Israel, and it was only after she got married that she made aliyah in 1965, together with her husband, who was a Holocaust survivor as well. ""I wanted to come home to the State of Israel. It was not an easy transition for me; my husband passed away at a young age and I was left alone with the children.""

She has been filled with worry and fear since Oct. 7. ""I was a baby during the Holocaust in Europe, and I had a family. But now, who will protect me? Everyone is in distress. There is pain in my heart for Omer, but there is also pain in my heart for my sons -- Omer's father and Omer's uncle, who barely speaks. He has no children of his own, so his brother's children are in fact his children as well.

""I wish us better days. Almost every morning, I hope that maybe there was a miracle last night and I missed it. In my heart, I am torn to pieces. I have always thought it could have been worse. Long ago, I decided there was nothing to cry about, and I still don't cry to this day. I just feel like my nose is a little wet.""

Wenkert wishes to convey a message to her grandson: ""Please come home, Omer, stay safe, and do whatever you want. When you visit Grandma, take her abroad. It is now your turn to take her. Did you hear that, my baby?""

'Back then, we were scattered all over the world, but now we are in a country with our own army'

Pnina Ben Yosef, 84

""I remember every detail of that terrible day,"" says Holocaust survivor Pnina Ben Yosef, 84, a resident of Kfar Maimon in the ""Gaza Envelope."" As she woke up to the explosions of missiles, she thought they were heavier than usual.

""With a broken leg, I sat with a cup of coffee in front of the window and wondered why people don't attend the synagogue. It was Simchat Torah. At that moment, my daughter and grandson, who was already wearing a military uniform, broke into my home, informed me that a war had broken out, and took me to the [bomb] shelter.""

She stayed at the shelter for many hours, unaware of what was happening outside. A group of terrorists approached the moshav fence and managed to shoot down a helicopter, but soldiers killed them.

Ben Yosef considers this a miracle: ""If this had not happened, there would most likely have been a massacre here as well. In the afternoon, we received a WhatsApp message calling all gun owners to the armory. I wondered if I should ride my scooter out with my personal gun, but I was afraid.""

She remained at the shelter until Tuesday afternoon when the chairman of the local emergency team came to tell her she had to leave. She refused. After he bluntly explained that she would be a burden if she stayed, Ben Yosef left Kfar Maimon, for the first time in her life feeling that her time had passed and that she could no longer contribute.

For the Israeli public, Kfar Maimon will be remembered as the place where tens of thousands of protesters opposing the disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005 did not march as planned to Gush Katif after the Yesha Council prevented the police from breaching the perimeter.

""Had the demonstration continued and they had been successful in stopping the deportation, Oct. 7 would not have taken place. The difficult circumstances began after the deportation. We received strong fences, electric gates and shelters, but maybe now we will get tunnels and bunkers as well,"" she concludes.

Amid the events of the past year, Ben Yosef realized how much these days differed from her childhood in Europe.

""I was born after the German invasion of Poland, a year after my uncle was murdered. As a locomotive driver, my father carried supplies to the front and brought back wounded people. One day, he stopped in our town, told the family what he saw and what was happening to Jews, and told them to leave everything and run away. As they have lived there for hundreds of years and have experienced many pogroms, they believed that it would also pass eventually.

""He managed to rescue only my mother and me; the rest stayed behind and perished. We escaped to Russia. After the war, we were deported back to Poland, and it turned out that nobody was left in the family. We ended up in a refugee camp in Austria, in which we stayed until 1948, and in April we arrived in Israel.""

According to Ben Yosef, the Holocaust of European Jews is a completely distinct event from the Oct. 7 massacre.

""We were scattered all over the world during the Holocaust, we were powerless to do anything to stop the slaughter, but now we are here in our country with our own army. We were shocked and terrified, and our losses were huge, but we managed to pull ourselves together and raise our heads.""",jns.org,news,Jewish News Syndicate,,0.2627450980392156,452601697,4,https://cdn.jns.org/uploads/2024/05/Beeri-home.jpg,

Europe is less hard-working, less ambitious, more regulated and more risk-averse than the United States, Nicolai Tangen, chief executive of the Norwegian Petroleum Fund, told the Financial Times. ""Simply, Americans work harder"", he explains.

One imagines Norwegians as peaceful people who think about whales and winning Eurovision, but then you walk around the buildings in the center of Oslo and what you see is steep, vertical capitalism. A country of soldiers and bankers, or of bankers trained as soldiers. Like Tangen himself, who before becoming a fund manager in London studied interrogation techniques at the Norwegian intelligence service.

The Norwegians have built a powerful welfare state thanks to Atlantic oil, but they want to be on the side of history. Next to the one who wins it. And the Oil Fund, the fourth investment fund in the world, invests less and less in European companies and more and more in American ones, because this is how they see the future.

European financial elites feel a chronic fascination with the United States. For their employers, direct and informal like cowboys. For the labor market, less protected. For low taxes. In contrast, life expectancy in Europe is five or six years higher, as is the quality of life. Europeans have more vacation days, work an hour less each day and enjoy a more effective social network.

In recent years, the United States has distanced itself from Europe. In 2013, European GDP was equal to 90% of that of the US. In 2022 it was already 23% lower. Demographics explain the jump. Immigration has rejuvenated the workforce on the other side of the Atlantic. Europe, on the contrary, distrusts the immigrant and is getting old.

Since the pandemic, the recovery in Europe has been faltering. In the United States it has been intense and they have been able to activate all the differential levers: abundant and cheap energy and an open field for new technologies. The White House has also collaborated. It has subsidized the installation of solar panel and semiconductor factories.

In the United States, full employment has fueled wage increases, in the lowest and highest segments. With stratospheric salaries in tech jobs, where $400,000 a year is not uncommon. Of course, inflation is unforgiving and life is very expensive. A loaf of bread, $6 in California. A preschool visit to the pediatrician, $360. A nursery in New York, $3,300.

Europe lived the best time between 1985 and 2005. It was the reference model. But 2005 began what Timothy Garton Ash describes in his latest book as a downward spiral: financial crisis, Russian occupation of Crimea, Charlie Hebdo attacks, populism in Hungary and Poland, Brexit, Trump... The historian looks back, back to the good old days, and evokes Stefan Zweig's The World of Yesterday. The Austrian wrote it in 1941, convinced that the Europe he longed for and loved so much (the one before 1914) would never return.

Garton Ash's fatalism seems forced. Or maybe not? The war in Ukraine has left Europe without its usual supplier of raw materials, Russia. It has transformed China from a cheap supplier to a systemic competitor in vital industries. Europe is beginning to wonder if the quality of life it has enjoyed may not have had something to do with all this and the American protective umbrella. For the first time Europe feels that it can stand alone. What will happen if the Americans leave? Who will arrest Putin?

Emmanuel Macron is the most skilled at conveying this change of mood. In August 2022, the president spoke of the ""end of abundance"". A week ago, at the Sorbonne, he said: ""It must be understood that Europe is mortal, it can die"". And he added: ""The rules of the game have changed.""

The EU has tasked Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta (what will the Italians have that we don't have?) to clarify what the new rules of the game are and how to restore lost trust. Mario Draghi's answer is the most surprising, because of the self-criticism it implies for someone who has been a Goldman Sachs banker.

Three basic ideas, three dirty gems, of Draghi's reflection. The first, that globalization has led to imbalances that European governments have taken a long time to recognize. In particular, the EU's misguided response to the 2011 euro crisis, in which it sought short-term competitiveness with reduced wage costs and austerity that weakened domestic demand and our social model.

second The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have created an environment of geopolitical rivalries in which not everyone follows the same rules of the game and in which exporting is no longer a guarantee of success. Indeed, China and the United States use industrial policy to redirect investment into their own economies. Europe has not even considered it.

And third In the midst of a fierce race for leadership in the world of new technologies, Europe does not have a strategy to compete, neither in telecommunications nor in defense. It also does not have the resources needed for the energy transition secured (they are in the hands of China). Europe must start acting now as an economic nation, not as a more or less asymmetrical federation of different economies.

Draghi is not talking about working more, as the Norwegian banker is asking, but that won't make the road any easier.

I would like to meet Emmanuel Macron's ghost writer, the man who writes his speeches. It's true. The French president is so theatrical and pompous that when he announces the ""End of Abundance"", it is hard not to remember that he has been an investment banker at Rothschild and suspect that he may be talking about his personal wealth. Because in reality the abundance, the golden age he talks about, for most people, ended with the Great Recession of 2008 and was made of heaps of debt.

But no. Forget Macron's fortune and look inside the head of the person who wrote his televised speech on August 23. Find out to what extent the employee chased the four ideas outlined by the president on the fly and how well they fit on paper. How did he know how to capture the spirit of the times in which European leaders live, the atmosphere of the end of an era in which they move. This end that the scribe summed up in three commandments: ""End of Abundance"", that is, end of raw materials, water, technology, bank liquidity; ""End of Carelessness"", the war, the climate; ""End of Evidence"", that is, of democracy, human rights...

It is impossible not to think of these words this week, when Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, died. Calç We must remember the horizons that this man opened during the second half of the 80s, how he got us to forget about the threat of the nuclear Apocalypse and how he knew how to return democracy to millions of Central Europeans, the ""kidnapped West"" of what Milan Kundera was talking about.

Calç We must remember the euphoria and arrogance of the great American power when it finally felt alone in command. Because what went wrong to end up where we are? How to define the succession of lived events: war on terror, Great Recession of 2008, Trump, Brexit, climate crisis, pandemic and, finally, war in Ukraine.

war Six months after the invasion of Ukraine, we know that Russia has intelligence services that are experts in poisoning the opposition, but so ill-informed that they believed that the Ukrainians would throw themselves into the arms of the Russians as liberators. We have also discovered that Vladimir Putin is a man who does not care about cattle. That you have experience in the war of attrition, that you are ready to ruin the neighbor by cutting off his gas and that in the worst case, he can play with the nuclear weapon.

Europe was refounded in 1992 with an optimistic political formula. Insufficient, but hopeful, in a context in which it is wanted to believe that the old empires would disarm. He believed the mantra that borders were out of fashion so much that he ended up giving the gas key to Russia. A terrible idea.

The death of Gorbachev makes it easier for us to review the events that happened from the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification to the wild years of Boris Yeltsin in Russia. This review is summarized in two ideas. One: Gorbachev was a blessing to humanity, a pacifist, the politician of ""the European common house"". But he was a failure as a statesman, an accident of the bureaucracy that made him an empathetic individual, but who was moving forward without a specific direction. With another comrade secretary, the USSR would have survived, just like China with Deng Xiaoping. In this way we would have spared ourselves the war in Ukraine.

Idea number two. The West was cruel and vindictive towards Russia. He left it bleeding in the nineties. He lied, or did not tell the whole truth with the expansion of NATO to the East. The Americans were so blinded by success that they repeated the mistake of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany: they did not welcome Russia to the winning side and did not smooth the catastrophic transition to capitalism.

These are respectable ideas. Blaming Gorbachev for having condemned the Soviet Union to its dissolution is very similar to what Putin thinks. It is not taking into account the right of peoples and citizens to express themselves freely (even if there are those who think that before democracy there is food). The second idea is plausible. But every country has its leaders who have fallen for it. Yeltsin did not seem like a deluded man. About the shock therapy that he did so badly in Russia, it is true, it was the big mistake. But during the golden age of neoliberalism, the ones who dictated the rules were the banks that did the business. Not governments.

All this is part of the past. The problem of the present is the winter (in the real and metaphorical sense) that is presented to Europe. Monetary authorities failed to see in time the enormous liquidity released during the recovery phase of the pandemic and underestimated the extent of the disruption to supply chains. That's why we have the highest inflation in forty years. Because of this and because we are running out of energy. Correcting this inflation - raising rates, reducing credit - will be painful. But it will be more to resist a prohibitive electricity. The question is not whether we will experience a recession, but how deep it will be.

How will all this affect our beliefs about Ukraine? Will Europe maintain its support for the Ukrainians, or will it start nagging Zelenski to give up the pact? Now is when we could end up as an important Catalan politician ended up: it is possible that in the coming months the Europeans will not be enshrined.

Calç We must remember the horizons that this man opened during the second half of the 80s, how he got us to forget about the threat of the nuclear Apocalypse and how he knew how to return democracy to millions of Central Europeans, the ""kidnapped West"" of what Milan Kundera was talking about.

Calç We must remember the euphoria and arrogance of the great American power when it finally felt alone in command. Because what went wrong to end up where we are? How to define the succession of lived events: war on terror, Great Recession of 2008, Trump, Brexit, climate crisis, pandemic and, finally, war in Ukraine.

war Six months after the invasion of Ukraine, we know that Russia has intelligence services that are experts in poisoning the opposition, but so ill-informed that they believed that the Ukrainians would throw themselves into the arms of the Russians as liberators. We have also discovered that Vladimir Putin is a man who does not care about cattle. That you have experience in the war of attrition, that you are ready to ruin the neighbor by cutting off his gas and that in the worst case, he can play with the nuclear weapon.

Europe was refounded in 1992 with an optimistic political formula. Insufficient, but hopeful, in a context in which it is wanted to believe that the old empires would disarm. He believed the mantra that borders were out of fashion so much that he ended up giving the gas key to Russia. A terrible idea.

The death of Gorbachev makes it easier for us to review the events that happened from the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification to the wild years of Boris Yeltsin in Russia. This review is summarized in two ideas. One: Gorbachev was a blessing to humanity, a pacifist, the politician of ""the European common house"". But he was a failure as a statesman, an accident of the bureaucracy that made him an empathetic individual, but who was moving forward without a specific direction. With another comrade secretary, the USSR would have survived, just like China with Deng Xiaoping. In this way we would have spared ourselves the war in Ukraine.

Idea number two. The West was cruel and vindictive towards Russia. He left it bleeding in the nineties. He lied, or did not tell the whole truth with the expansion of NATO to the East. The Americans were so blinded by success that they repeated the mistake of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany: they did not welcome Russia to the winning side and did not smooth the catastrophic transition to capitalism.

These are respectable ideas. Blaming Gorbachev for having condemned the Soviet Union to its dissolution is very similar to what Putin thinks. It is not taking into account the right of peoples and citizens to express themselves freely (even if there are those who think that before democracy there is food). The second idea is plausible. But every country has its leaders who have fallen for it. Yeltsin did not seem like a deluded man. About the shock therapy that he did so badly in Russia, it is true, it was the big mistake. But during the golden age of neoliberalism, the ones who dictated the rules were the banks that did the business. Not governments.

All this is part of the past. The problem of the present is the winter (in the real and metaphorical sense) that is presented to Europe. Monetary authorities failed to see in time the enormous liquidity released during the recovery phase of the pandemic and underestimated the extent of the disruption to supply chains. That's why we have the highest inflation in forty years. Because of this and because we are running out of energy. Correcting this inflation - raising rates, reducing credit - will be painful. But it will be more to resist a prohibitive electricity. The question is not whether we will experience a recession, but how deep it will be.

How will all this affect our beliefs about Ukraine? Will Europe maintain its support for the Ukrainians, or will it start nagging Zelenski to give up the pact? Now is when we could end up as an important Catalan politician ended up: it is possible that in the coming months the Europeans will not be enshrined.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.4274509803921569,452594057,7,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_a4968.png,

Europe is less hard-working, less ambitious, more regulated and more risk-sensitive than the United States, Nicolai Tangen, chief executive of the Norwegian Oil Fund, tells the Financial Times. ""Americans simply work harder,"" he concludes.

One imagines Norwegians as peaceful people who think about whales and winning at Eurovision. But you walk through the buildings of downtown Oslo and what you discover is an abrupt, vertical capitalism. A country of soldiers and bankers. Or from bankers trained as soldiers. Like Tangen himself, who before becoming a fund manager in London studied interrogation techniques in the Norwegian intelligence service.

The Norwegians have built a welfare state thanks to Atlantic oil, but they want to be on the side of history. On the side of the one who wins it. And the Oil Fund, the fourth largest investment fund in the world, invests less and less in European companies and more and more in American companies, because that is how they see the future.

European financial elites have a chronic fascination with the United States. By its businessmen, direct and informal like cowboys. Due to the less protected labor market. Because of low taxes. On the other hand, life expectancy in Europe is five or six years higher; so is the quality of life. Europeans have more vacation days, work one hour less a day and enjoy a more effective social network.

In recent years the US has distanced itself from Europe. In 2013, European GDP was equivalent to 90% of that of the US. In 2022 it was already 23% lower. Demographics explain that jump. Immigration has rejuvenated the workforce on the other side of the Atlantic. Europe, on the other hand, is suspicious of immigrants and grows older.

Since the pandemic, the recovery in Europe has been halting. In the United States it has been intense and all its differential levers have been activated: abundant and cheap energy and open field for new technologies. The White House has also collaborated. It has subsidized the installation of solar panel and semiconductor factories.

In the United States, full employment has triggered wage increases. In the lowest and highest segments. With stratospheric salaries in technological employment, where $400,000 per year are not uncommon. Of course, inflation is unforgiving and life is very expensive. A loaf of bread, $6 in California. A preschool visit to the pediatrician, $360. A daycare in New York, $3,300.

Europe lived its best moment between 1985 and 2005. It was the reference model. But in 2005, what Timothy Garton Ash describes in his latest book as a downward turn began: financial crisis, Russian occupation of Crimea, Charlie Hebdo attacks, populism in Hungary and Poland, Brexit, Trump... The historian looks back , to the good times, and evokes Stefan Zweig's The World of Yesterday. The Austrian wrote it in 1941 convinced that the Europe he longed for (the one before 1914) was no longer going to return.

Garton Ash's fatalism seems forced. Or maybe not? The war in Ukraine has left Europe without its usual supplier of raw materials, Russia. It has transformed China from a cheap supplier to a systemic competitor in vital industries. Europe is beginning to wonder if the quality of life it has enjoyed may not have had something to do with all that and with the American protective umbrella. For the first time Europe feels that it can be left alone. What will happen if the Americans leave? Who will stop Putin?

Emmanuel Macron is the most skilled at conveying that change of mood. In August 2022, the president spoke of the ""end of abundance."" A week ago, at the Sorbonne, he said: ""We must understand that Europe is mortal, it can die."" And he added: ""The rules of the game have changed.""

The EU has commissioned Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta (what will the Italians have?) to elucidate what the new rules of the game are and how lost trust is restored. Mario Draghi's response is the most surprising, due to the self-criticism it implies for someone who has been a Goldman Sachs banker.

Three basic ideas, three raw gems, from Draghi's reflection. First, globalization has brought imbalances that European governments have been slow to recognize. In particular, the EU's erroneous response to the 2011 euro crisis, in which it sought short-term competitiveness with a reduction in wage costs and austerity that weakened internal demand and our social model.

Second. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have created an environment of geopolitical rivalries in which not everyone follows the same rules of the game and where exports are no longer a guarantee of success. In fact, China and the United States use industrial policy to redirect investment into their own economies. Europe has not even considered it.

And third. In the midst of a fierce race for leadership in new technologies, Europe does not have a strategy to compete in it, neither in telecommunications or defense. Nor does it have the necessary resources for the energy transition assured (they are in the hands of China). Europe must now begin to act as an economic nation, not as a more or less asymmetric federation of different economies.

Draghi does not talk about working more, as the Norwegian banker asks. But that's not going to make the path any easier.

I would like to meet Emmanuel Macron's ghost writer, the man who writes his speeches. It's true. The French president is so theatrical and bombastic that when he announces the ""End of Abundance"", it is hard not to remember that he has been an investment banker at Rothschild and suspect that he may be talking about his personal wealth. Because in reality the abundance, the golden age he talks about, for most people, ended with the Great Recession of 2008 and was made of piles of debt.

But no. Forget Macron's fortune and look inside the head of the person who wrote his televised speech on August 23. Find out to what extent the employee hunted down the four ideas outlined by the president and how well they fit on paper. How he knew how to capture the spirit of the times in which European leaders live, the atmosphere of the end of an era in which they move. This end that the scribe summarized in three commandments: ""End of Abundance"", that is, end of raw materials, water, technology, bank liquidity; ""End of Carelessness"", the war, the climate; ""End of Evidence"", that is to say, of democracy, human rights...
