It would appear that the Cold War is upon us again! However, seen from another perspective, there are some signs of revival in the relationship. For instance, the US has announced phase IV of its missile defence deployment, which moves missiles away from targeting Russia. After the Boston bombings, Moscow and Washington have been cooperating more intensely on counter terrorism. There has also been an exchange of letters between President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin and the two countries have announced a US-Russia summit in Moscow in September this year. Putin's downplaying of the Snowden affair and warning him against any actions that would hurt the US is also a sign of Russia's willingness to cooperate with Washington. No doubt, the US-Russia relationship is awash with contradictions. This paper attempts to explore these contradictions through a study of their bilateral interactions on various issues such as counter-terrorism, Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, missile and nuclear issues and human rights. It also examines the impact of domestic politics on their bilateral relationship.

After Obama took over as President, he tried to 'reset' the US-Russia relationship. One of the key components of this strategy was the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which mandates reductions in nuclear arms by 2018. That the Russians agreed to reduce their stockpile of nuclear arms was a significant victory for Obama. However, Moscow and Washington have not yet been able to reach an agreement on ballistic missile defence. Russia has for long been concerned about NATO's expansion to Eastern Europe as well as its plans to set up Ballistic Missile Defense systems in countries like Poland, ostensibly against attacks from Iran and North Korea. Moreover, Moscow worries that the US missile defence programme could drive China to strengthen its offensive nuclear forces capability1, which would have security consequences for Russia. Russia has, therefore, demanded legally binding guarantees from the US and NATO that these systems would not be used against it -- but so far to no avail. However, the announcement in March this year by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to scrap the final phase of the European missile defence system might somewhat assuage Russian grievances and open the way for fresh talks on nuclear arms control negotiations. Russian scholars also believe that this is a ""window of opportunity"" and it is now time for serious negotiations between Russia and the US to ""reach compromise agreements that will respond to each country's security interests and strengthen strategic stability"".2

Although Russia has refused to extend the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program which dismantles and safeguards nuclear and chemical weapons in the areas under the former USSR, the good news is that the two countries have announced that they will sign an agreement which will secure and destroy nuclear materials and prevent their spread. The agreement, however, does not include biological or chemical weapons which were covered under the Nunn-Lugar CTR program. Further, President Obama has called for reducing deployed American strategic nuclear warheads by a third if Russia agrees to do the same. While Russia's response to this announcement has not been enthusiastic so far, it will be interesting to see how matters play out in this regard.

Counter-terrorism

The US and Russia share concerns about global terrorism and have worked together on this issue. The Boston bombings opened up an opportunity for the two countries to work together on counter-terrorism. There is a recognition in the US that perhaps the bombings could have been thwarted if the US and Russia had cooperated more on terrorism. Russia had shared intelligence about the Boston bombers with the FBI. But according to several news reports, American authorities did not take this intelligence seriously because they were presented a sanitised version of information on the bombers as the Russians did not want to reveal their sources and how they had obtained the intelligence.3 But the fact that Moscow did share such intelligence is testimony to its willingness to cooperate with Washington on fighting terrorism. Russia and the US announced at the G-8 meeting held in June in Fermanagh, Northern Ireland that they will intensify their cooperation, with information exchange and combined counter-terrorism operations.

Afghanistan

This intensified cooperation becomes crucial in the light of the US drawdown in Afghanistan. Moscow supported American efforts to oust the Taliban, following the September 11 attacks, by not opposing the grant of bases by the Central Asian Republics to the US. Even today, the US and Russia have similar concerns in Afghanistan. After Islamabad denied supply routes to Afghanistan following NATO attacks on military check posts in Pakistan, Russia allowed the US to use the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) to transport important supplies to and from Afghanistan. Though some experts feel that the volume transiting through the NDN is not very much, the fact that Russia is allowing the use of NDN is significant. Further, Russia has allowed NATO to start a transit hub in Ulyanovsk, Russia to support the drawdown from Afghanistan. In the post 2014 scenario, Russia's support to the modalities of ISAF drawdown (particularly the use of the NDN) and the maintenance of any long term US presence in the country will be crucial.4 Washington and Moscow do not want Afghanistan to become a launching pad for extremists again after the US drawdown. In the post 2014 scenario, Washington will require Moscow's support for sustaining counter-terrorism, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities in the region.5

Central Asia

There are strong disagreements between the US and Russia on Central Asia. Russia has concerns about American influence and bases in Central Asia, which it considers to be part of its ""near abroad"" or sphere of influence. It is wary of American support to pro-democracy movements in the region, fearing it could result in the fall of regimes with which it has close ties and increase instability in the region. But given America's drawdown in Afghanistan, the shale gas revolution in the US, the US 'rebalance' to the Asia Pacific and, most importantly, the US economic decline, Washington's attention to this region is likely to reduce. Given that Obama has resisted the temptation to intervene in conflicts around the world, Washington may not want to or be able to sustain an intense involvement in the region -- thereby somewhat dissipating Russia's concerns.

Middle East

The Middle East, particularly since the Arab uprisings, has emerged as an area of contention between Moscow and Washington. Moscow abstained from voting on UNSC resolution 1973 which imposed a nofly zone on Libya. Moreover, it felt betrayed by the West which, according to Moscow, used the resolution to intervene in Libya. The West's action flew in the face of Russia's steadfast faith in the principle of nonintervention in other countries' internal affairs. Since then, Moscow has refused to support the West's polices towards the Arab Spring.

It is Syria which has emerged as the most vexed issue in US-Russia relations in recent times and the two countries have what President Obama describes as ""differing perspectives"" on the war though both agree on the need to end violence. Russia has criticised the US for its policy in Syria and has vetoed resolutions in the UNSC calling for sanctions against President Assad's regime. Moreover, it continues to support Assad and has announced that it will supply antiaircraft missiles and MIG fighters to Syria even as the EU has ended its arms embargo on Syria. Russia has its own problems with Islamic extremism and the growing radicalisation in the Northern Caucasus.6 Russia's concern is that Assad's fall may result in radical Islamist elements taking control in Syria. Moscow is also concerned about the fate of the Orthodox Christians in Syria. Moreover, Syria is an important arms importer for Russia and the latter's naval base in Tartu, so far, is the only base for the Russian Navy in the Mediterranean. But this is not a very big or a critical base for the Russians. They might even be willing to give it up if necessary.

Despite their differences with the US on Syria, the Russians have persevered and have been able to get the US on board for talks to be held at Geneva (the Geneva II talks) to resolve the imbroglio. Though at the moment, there seems little chance of the talks being held in the immediate future, it could possibly bring about a resolution to the Syrian crisis. The turmoil in Egypt is fuelling Russian skepticism about the 'Arab Spring'. Russia feels that the upheavals in the Middle East will only lead to instability and, probably, radical extremists gaining power.

Another issue of contention is Iran. Russia has relatively good ties with Iran though it has agreed to an arms embargo on the country and broke a contract to supply the S-300 long-range air defense missile system to Tehran. Iran and Russia, along with India, cooperated in supporting the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. After the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Moscow and Tehran might again have to cooperate to protect their interests.

Russia and the US are part of the P-5 plus 1. However, Russia and the US have serious differences over Iran's nuclear programme. Though Washington and Moscow broadly share concerns about Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, they differ on the tactics to be used against Tehran. In 2010, Russia supported UN sanctions against Iran but has refused to support further sanctions since 2011. It feels that being too harsh on Iran could have the reverse effect of making it more determined to acquire nuclear weapons or walk out of the NPT.7 Russia also has commercial interests in Iran. It helped Iran build the Bushehr nuclear plant despite US opposition. Russia wants Iran to participate in the Geneva-II talks on Syria as it feels it could contribute to resolving the crisis, a move that the West opposes.

The issue of human rights remains an impediment in Russia-US relations. US officials have time and again come down strongly on Russia for its alleged human rights abuses and growing authoritarianism. Russia, on its part, accuses the US of interfering in its internal affairs. The Russian argument is that US policy of exporting democracy is flawed and will lead to instability. Egypt is one example of this. Russia feels that each country will arrive at, through its own process, a political system that suits it best. Russia even accused the US of supporting, if not fostering, the protests against Putin in the last two years. Relations reached a new low after the US passed the Magnitsky Act, which denies visas to officials allegedly involved in the death of the Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, in prison and freezed their assets in the US. In retaliation, Russia passed the Dima Yakovlev Act banning Americans from adopting Russian children, on the grounds that adopted Russian children have faced mistreatment in the US. The US recently published a list of 18 officials banned from travelling to the US under the Magnitsky Act. But, in what is being seen as a concession to Russia, most of the Russians named are minor officials. Russia has also published a ""stoplist"" of 18 American citizens allegedly involved in human rights abuses at Guantanamo Bay and against Russian citizens. Moreover, Russia has put restrictions on the operations and funding of NGOs in the country and thrown USAID out of the country.

Domestic Politics

The domestic political atmosphere in both countries is not favourable for stronger relations. Domestic constituencies play an important role in American foreign policy. There is no strong pro-Russia lobby in the US. Russian-Americans are not a significant voting bloc. In fact, the anti-Russia lobby continues to be very strong, thereby tying the President's hands on any rapprochement. The Russian diaspora's influence is also limited. Given the poor state of economic relations, there are no large stakeholders in either country who are prepared to lobby for the relationship.

Moreover, in the US, both the liberals and the conservatives resist good ties with Russia for differing reasons; the liberals because of human rights concerns and the conservatives because they still see Russia as a foe (e.g. Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney's description of Russia as the US' ""number one geopolitical foe"" during the US elections last year). Above all, there are well-organised groups with links to the defence sector and the military-industrial complex which work against arms reduction or the development of cooperation in the military and political areas.8 In such a domestic scenario, no wonder that despite his best intentions, President Obama has been unable to push his reset policy ahead. The domestic situation in Russia is no less conducive for good ties with the US. President Putin suspects the US of trying to overthrow his regime. In fact, during his presidential campaign, Putin's supporters accused the US of financing protests against their leader. The theme of Anti-Americanism was used by Putin during his election to consolidate domestic support, particularly among his working class base. So, given the domestic imperatives in both countries, there is little political incentive to improve relations.

Economic Relations

Economic relations, key to fostering better relations in a globalised world, between Russia and the US remain minimal. Russia has a positive trade balance with the US. In 2012, bilateral trade in goods reached just over $40 billion, much below bilateral trade between the US and China, as well as with other emerging countries like India, and Brazil.9 While the US' main exports to Russia are machinery, vehicles, aircraft, meat and optic and medical instruments (just 0.6% of its total exports), Russia's main exports to the US are mineral fuel, iron and steel, precious stones, inorganic chemical and fertilizers.10 In 2010, US investments in Russia were about $9.9 billion, while Russian investments in the US were about $ 4.4 billion,11 which is again much below potential. Some of the major problems impeding trade include US concerns about weak Intellectual Property Rights enforcement in Russia, lack of transparency in Russia, inefficient government regulations and corruption.12 On the Russian side, a variety of sanctions, export controls and other trade barriers restrict its access to US technology and trade. However, with Russia's recent entry into the WTO and the repeal of the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik Amendment extending 'Permanent Normal Trade Relations' status to Russia, there is a real chance for trade to grow between the US and Russia. Some experts opine that US exports to Russia could reach $ 20 billion over the next five years.13 For Russia, this is an opportunity for it to modernise its economy and diversify its exports base.14 Some signs of a revival of economic relations are evident: ExxonMobil and Rosneft have agreed on a joint venture for exploring the Arctic and Black Sea and participation of Rosneft in joint projects with ExxonMobil in the US and Canada.15

Conclusion

The US and Russia have had an uneasy relationship ever since the end of the Cold War. While they have cooperated in some areas, the relationship continues to be driven, to some extent, by a refusal on both sides to let go off the legacies of the Cold War. While Russia believes that it has not been given the recognition due to a great power, much of the US establishment appears to see Russia as a rival. Thus, relations are characterised by distrust on both sides.

For Russia, its bilateral relationship with the US is crucial at the moment. However, this is being rapidly challenged by its relationship with China. The pro-China lobby in Russia has been growing in strength over the last few years. Moscow's closeness to Beijing is further propelled by fear of a G-2 between Washington and Beijing. While economic relations between Russia and China might seem like a win-win for both countries, Russia is aware that in the long term, it might turn into a resource adjunct for China. Therefore, for Russia to maintain viability as a power and to retain its territorial integrity, it will have to diversify its economy from natural resource exports which contribute to a substantial part of its revenue. But to move into manufacturing and modernise its economy, Russia needs finance and technology. While the finances might be available with China, the technologies required for this modernisation are available only with the West -- particularly the US. Moreover, the West can help Russia to commercialise some of the technologies that it has independently developed over the years.

On the other hand, for the US, its relations with Russia are currently not a top priority and its focus is on the Asia-Pacific. But it is important for the US that it overcomes its distrust of Russia and improves relations in the context of the emerging US-China rivalry; a Russia which is in the Chinese camp would substantially tilt the balance towards China. Russia has announced its own pivot to the Asia-Pacific. Washington needs to leverage the positive contribution Moscow can make to Asia-Pacific security and stability. A multilateral Asian security architecture to deal with the rise of a more assertive China would be substantially strengthened if Russia were to be a part of it. Also, Moscow and Washington need to strengthen their cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue to bring about some resolution. Russia with its UN Security Council veto can be a huge spoiler for the US and prevent it from achieving its objectives on international issues.

Though Moscow and Washington have differences over several issues, as outlined above, none of these are insurmountable and there are several areas where they can work together. For instance, cyberspace and counter-narcotics are areas where cooperation can be bolstered. The two countries could also cooperate in exploring the Arctic resources. Russia desperately needs technologies from the West to map, explore and extract its resources in the region.16 Russia also wants to explore its shale gas resources, for which also it needs Western technology.17 Another sphere where they can cooperate is in measures to improve their images in both countries. People to people ties between Russia and the US are at a low level. So, one way to improve bilateral relations might be to increase the number of educational, cultural and scientific exchanges.

Thus, the Russian-American relationship is at an interesting phase at this point and it could either improve or worsen depending on the political will in both countries. It will be interesting also to see how the Snowden affair is handled by both countries. If Snowden is in Russia in September, when Obama is scheduled to attend the G-20 summit and Obama decides not to have a bilateral summit with Putin in Moscow, it will cause damage to their relations. If Russia and the US establish a dialogue that is free and frank and leads to bolstering their cooperation while managing their differences, there could possibly be a paradigm shift in the relationship. The prominent Russian academician, Sergei Rogov, in a study for the Russian International Affairs Council expresses the hope that the ""transition from mutually assured destruction to mutually assured stability should lead to mutually assured security for Russia and the United States"".18 Moscow and Washington have just announced the launch of a regular dialogue in the ""two plus two"" format between foreign and defence ministers to tackle issues of strategic stability, international security and shared threats. The world will be watching because stability in the US-Russia relationship will have a positive effect on international affairs.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Regional police unveiling today result of a major auto theft investigation. Tell you more about project on coming up. Right now. It's one 3rd 20 degrees from 299 queen street west. This is toronto's breaking news cp24. Good afternoon. I'm bakari savage. Pro-palestinian protesters, their joint by labour region, faculty and staff as a defiant trespass order to leave king's college circle and cp24 says it does get is live at u of t with the latest lindsay. >> Yeah, that rally wrapped up this morning. A car in the latest now is that the university says it's going to file an injunction to have these protesters removed from the encampment. And we do have a statement from the university released just last hour or so, every part of that for you now it says the notice of motion is proceeding normally and will be accessible through the usual process once it's filed off the court at 3.30 university avenue. We continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment and hope they will bring the unauthorized encampment to a peaceful and so the encampment here today, obviously, has not been dismantled yet. And students say they are not leaving bakari until the university has their 3 main demands. And we did hear from air maki who has become one of the spokes peers, people for the encampments. And she was talking a little bit more about the negotiations that are still continuing between the university and students. And also why students are staying here. Have a listen to what she had to say. My is being used to fund the development of weapons and bombs that are being dropped on the palestinian people. >> Which is why we're here, which is why, you know, we have no other choice but to continue these negotiations. And so, you know, the injunction was on pause until tomorrow. The court said that, yeah, they're going to postpone the hearing until tomorrow. So we'll have to kind of wait and see. But this evening at 5:00, we have another meeting with the administration to hopefully get them to commit to divestment. >> United will never be defeated. >> So if there is, as you potential for maybe a peaceful resolution, bakari, between the university and the students negotiations continue tonight, starting at 5:00. In the meantime, we're waiting to hear when that court date could be scheduled, usually after an injunction is filed. It's 24 to 48 hours afterwards. So could possibly be tomorrow or the day after that. The university has been wanting these protesters to dismantle their encampment over the last 25 days because they say it's causing some safety concerns for other students who are on campus who feel unsafe. But again, the protesters here say they have no plans to do until the university meets their demands preparing. Okay, continuing our coverage live from. >> King's college circle. Cp24 slice of the skin. There was a show of support today for north york jewish girls school. It was hit by gunfire over the weekend. Mayor olivia chow along with police chief myron demkiw, were among those who attended a solidarity rally this morning by the dais. How entering school district dufferin and police responded to a call for shots fired at school early saturday morning. They did find a bullet hole in the building. No one was hurt. Organizers say that today's demonstration was meant to show that show this school students, staff and families that the community stands with him. >> Oftentimes you stories on the news its ads and try to be empathetic when it's at home. It's a whole different this is not close to home. This is I spent many hours here day and and it was pretty shocking. >> I'm here to stand with you to say that anti-semitism, it's like cancer. We have to say no. It erodes the boss of empathy and compassion between people. Is saying no to decay over so side into hate and out and absolutely have no place in toronto. >> Let me make this clear and I'm sure many of you agree, we will not be intimidated. We live in the city. We helped build this city and we plan to stay. >> People come to toronto from all over the world to escape conflict zones to escape hate. We don't want your vile hate here. We're a city of peace and respect. >> Communities then strong, we teach that everybody's there for each other and that's how we have to stand together unity in one and show that if you hurt one, you hurt us all. >> Archie was can be stronger united and we take care of each other and we know that we have many friends and allies are going to be here with us as well, who also take care of us and support us. But really, we're trying to send a wake-up call to all of toronto. What's

happening in our city is scary. It's unacceptable impacts real lives. There are children who are affected by this and we need all over all of our neighbours of all communities stand with us and say hate against any community, including the 2 has no place in the city. >> Well, police have said that it's too early to determine if the shooting as a hate crime or act of terrorism, but noted that the hate crime unit is supporting the investigation. Residents in some neighbourhoods, they've been told to expect an increased police presence. 35 20 degrees right now. Let's get early look at the roads this afternoon with traffic specialist adwoa nsiah-yeboah good afternoon been watching this long-standing problem through milton involving a collision involving a jackknifed transport truck. It looks like things are. >> Starting to slowly get better. That truck is completely out of the ditch about some good news. Unfortunately from westbound for one approaching highway. 25 still, hov lane continues to squeeze by and a bit of a delay on the approach. But the good news, we had some problems on the eastbound lanes of the 401. It was only approach to dixie actually past dixie in the express that collision. It did clear problems persist. So eastbound for one, as you make a way to scarborough to kennedy collision involving a truck does have the right lane and the on ramp from kennedy to the eastbound 4, 1, it's also occupied promise to deal with as well. This is on the northbound lanes of the don valley parkway lawrence collision still there in the left lane. And we're getting word of some flooding. This is on the niagara-bound lanes of the qew approaching here. Ontario until on scene blocking the right lane. The flooding is actually at the end of the on ramp from your ontario. So that's also adding to a very slow commute. A reminder eastbound 4, 1, at highway 6 north collision cleanup in the 2 right lanes. And if your travels that do take it to city streets. Crews on scene of a collision on the lakeshore and I'll send it back to you. Bakari. Thanks a lot. Toronto is launching a partnership that aims to address its transportation challenges. Split. >> Cutting edge technology. The city signed a memorandum of understanding with the ontario vehicle innovation network. It's going to provide eligible companies with up to $100,000 in funding to test traffic management act, which utilizes 5 eur connectivity along with artificial intelligence. The city says that the agreement supports the congestion management plan council adopted last year. Siemiatycki, professor of geography and planning as well as director of infrastructure and university of toronto joined cp24 live at noon was more on how this project could help with the city's traffic woes. >> There have been dreams going back decades that we have automated traffic lights, that it would be able to make sure that when you're coming to the light is always green for you. But keep in mind when it screened for us red for someone else and that's always been a challenge, perhaps with new ai technologies. They can get more efficient. We think we can squeeze more efficiency out of the network. But overall, we have too many cars for not enough road space. This will make some difference, but it's not going to transform the gridlock that we're experiencing today. >> The pilot project is going to start in the summer at some toronto's busiest intersections. City staff are expected to report back on some of the findings at the end of the year. Well, we are following a developing story this afternoon. Boy is dead after shooting in the east end police. They continued investigation warden avenue in kenner, acting president. This is north of danforth road to say that a male youth was shot at 1:00 this morning.

The university issued a trespass notice to the protesters on friday, which requires them to vacate the property by 8:00am tomorrow morning. >> Ut has filed for an injunction ab to call the police to come at U.S. encampment.

We are holding a with members of cupe and the ontario federation for labour tomorrow morning at 8:00am at to ensure that, you know, if there is a police escalation, we have lots of supports and students who are here, but ultimately, we're not anticipating that because ut has gone to the process of filing this motion. And this injunction with the court. And they've got the costs of hiring a very expensive, very notorious law firm to do their bidding for them.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Instead, the best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy.

Over the past three years, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have worked to articulate a ""worker-centered"" trade policy while arguing for a ""new Washington consensus"" in U.S. international economic policy that will foster global investment and cooperation on issues like climate and development. Tai, Sullivan, and other U.S. officials have succeeded in laying out a vision for American industrial policy, one that has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars of announced investment in U.S. computer chip manufacturing and clean energy technology. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also has popularized the concept of ""friendshoring"" -- the idea that U.S. allies and partners can benefit as multinational corporations diversify away from China. This term first appeared in a 2021 White House report on supply chains.

But when it comes to the brass tacks of trade -- trade deals, tariff lines, the paperwork that companies have to file at the border, and other mechanics -- U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has not articulated a coherent agenda. At times, the administration has tried to use the specter of China's economic threat to generate support for trade deals. One notable example is its signature Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which is intended to strengthen economic relations between the United States and countries across the Pacific. But geopolitical arguments for deals are failing to carry the day. Last November, deep congressional skepticism and electoral concerns spurred the administration to indefinitely postpone the IPEF trade pillar, and it is unclear whether it will complete the work even after the 2024 election.

When it comes to the brass tacks of trade -- trade deals, tariff lines, the paperwork that companies have to file at the border, and other mechanics -- U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has not articulated a coherent agenda.

Former president Donald Trump, in his current campaign to return to the White House, does have a clear vision for trade: he has announced plans to deploy tariffs and other protectionist measures to support favored U.S. industries. The architect of Trump's trade policy between 2017 and early 2021, former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, has argued that the United States should vigorously deploy tariffs and other trade restrictions both to protect U.S. industry and to force not only China, but a variety of European and Asian countries, to cease unfair trade practices. However, a number of experts have raised concerns about the economic impacts of these policies as well as the risks they would pose to U.S. geopolitical relationships.

Resetting America's trade agenda and developing a trade vision capable of drawing broad support across Washington is going to require the government to, as Steve Jobs would have said, ""think different."" Rather than treating trade deals as a geopolitical endeavor that the United States should suffer through to support America's allies and partners, or pursuing Trump's vision of simply reducing trade (the geopolitical argument), the United States should get back to a basic premise that has guided successful trade policy in the past -- that policymakers can develop and promote trade policies that advance American economic interests as well as American geopolitical interests.

Resetting America's trade agenda and developing a trade vision capable of drawing broad support across Washington is going to require the government to, as Steve Jobs would have said, ""think different.""

Given the nature of the economic challenges the United States currently faces, this approach will require policymakers to spend less time on the geopolitics and more time on the economics. That choice, in turn, will encourage a shift in the primary focus away from regional deals and toward narrower sectoral deals that address the problems of greatest concern to most Americans, such as climate, energy, and the looming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. To actually solve those problems, the United States should be open to using a new set of tools in creating trade deals, including those related to financial instruments, development, and national security. Today's biggest challenges cannot be solved simply with market access and regulatory cooperation. The next chapter in American trade policy will need to entail new types of sectoral deals between the United States and key allies and partners on a set of issues that include climate and energy, supply chains, and AI and the digital economy.

Rebooting America's trade agenda first requires understanding why the protrade consensus that prevailed from the 1990s to the mid-2010s -- the most recent era of significant U.S. trade dealmaking -- broke down.

Since the end of World War II, the United States has undertaken successful rounds of trade dealmaking during periods when trade deals had both a clear geopolitical and a clear economic logic. In the late 1940s, in the aftermath of the war, the deal that fit both U.S. geopolitical and economic interests was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Geopolitically, American policymakers saw the GATT as a tool to shore up Western alliances in the nascent days of the Cold War. From an economic perspective, trade negotiators designed the GATT to be an antidote to prevent a return to the ""beggar thy neighbor"" tariff policies of the 1930s, which postwar economists and policymakers saw as having exacerbated the Great Depression. The agreement required reductions in tariff rates and ensured that members accorded each other ""most favored nation"" trading status to put further downward pressure on tariffs over time. From a U.S. perspective, American officials also understood the GATT as a tool to help open markets to U.S. goods at a time when the United States was the world's largest net exporter and needed foreign markets to replace war-driven demand for U.S. industry. Reductions in foreign tariffs on U.S. goods provided a major direct benefit for American industry.

Since the end of World War II, the United States has undertaken successful rounds of trade dealmaking during periods when trade deals had both a clear geopolitical and a clear economic logic.

The United States pushed to expand the GATT several times during the Cold War. The so-called Kennedy Round of 1964-1967 resulted in additional tariff reductions and began to establish disciplines around dumping, the practice where a country sells a product internationally at a lower price than the product sells for in its home market. The Tokyo Round of the 1970s expanded participation in the GATT to more than one hundred countries, seeking to include much of the nonaligned developing world. It began to try to tackle nontariff barriers and ""voluntary export restraints,"" a type of measure where countries would agree to limit export quantities in exchange for avoiding tariffs. With the introduction of a Subsidies Code, the Tokyo Round also began to introduce the concept of rules around subsidies.

However, the modern trade orthodoxy that guided U.S. trade policy from the end of the Cold War through the mid-2010s crystallized in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The fall of the Berlin Wall ushered in America's unipolar moment, when America's geopolitical policymakers saw an opportunity to use trade and economic relations to anchor its former Soviet adversaries and emerging geopolitical competitors, notably China, in a U.S.-led international order. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, meanwhile, presided over a period of neoliberal economic consensus in Washington that Washington thought was an economic model appropriate for the world as well. Trade policy and trade deals (as well as other policy levers such as the International Monetary Fund) offered a tool to promote that U.S. economic model abroad. This intersection of geopolitics and economics ushered in a remarkably productive period of trade policymaking, with initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and free trade agreements (FTAs) with more than a dozen nations. Other related policies included the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which cut tariffs on imports from democratic countries in Africa in a bid to foster development and democratic progress on the continent.

The deals of this era had a clear geopolitical logic. NAFTA was designed to strengthen the North American political union and, in the eyes of both presidents Bush and Clinton, to provide an eventual pathway toward a more democratic and economically unified Western Hemisphere -- a vision that George H. W. Bush's son and later president George W. Bush, took further with the Central America-Dominican Republic FTA (CAFTA-DR) a decade after NAFTA entered into force. The WTO, and China's ultimate accession to it at the end of the decade, reflected the prevailing 1990s geopolitical view that a global trading arrangement would help draw countries like China toward the West. As Clinton said of China's accession in 1999, ""it represents the most significant opportunity that we have had to create positive change in China since the 1970s,"" noting that China was ""agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values: economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people."" Or, as George W. Bush said about U.S. legislation to enact the CAFTA-DR agreement, ""this bill is more than a trade bill. This bill is a commitment of freedom-loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the Western hemisphere.""

FTAs with Morocco (2004), Bahrain (2005), and Oman (2006), enacted in the years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, were intended to bolster American allies in the war against Islamic terrorism and with the aspiration that economic progress could reduce the terrorist threat. In a 2003 presidential speech, George W. Bush laid out his economic vision for the region, which proposed bilateral FTAs as stepping stones toward a Middle East Free Trade Area. As he remarked, ""across the globe, free markets and trade have helped defeat poverty, and taught men and women the habits of liberty.""

The economic logic behind these deals was as important as the geopolitics. From a macroeconomic perspective, the trade deals of this era reflected a view that the U.S. economy could benefit from offshoring lower-value U.S. manufacturing in order to lower consumer costs, while encouraging the domestic growth of higher-value industries like software, healthcare, and value-added manufacturing. As Clinton put it in 1993, ""this debate about NAFTA is a debate about whether we will embrace [economic] changes and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist these changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structures of yesterday."" Trade globalization was thought to create opportunities for new U.S. exports, encourage innovation by forcing companies to compete globally, and lower consumer costs. Furthering Clinton's argument in support of NAFTA and an aspirational Latin America free trade deal, policymakers also thought that an expanded U.S. trade block could deliver the economies of scale needed to compete with the emerging European Union trade block and growing intra-Asian regional trade.

With the texts of the deals themselves, trade policymakers sought to promote the then-prevailing economic consensus in Washington, which championed reduced government subsidies; nondiscrimination for goods produced by other countries; lower regulatory burdens for business, including the then-nascent digital economy; and strong intellectual property (IP) protections. Policymakers also sought to promote higher labor and environmental standards and to tackle challenges like corruption. Senior figures in Washington often spoke of these goals as raising standards internationally and writing global rules based on U.S. rules.

The WTO's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), which went into effect in 1995, for example, drastically expanded the pre-WTO GATT's disciplines regarding industrial subsidies. Throughout the text of the WTO agreements and U.S. FTAs, countries agreed to accord ""national treatment"" to each other's goods, committing not to give preference to domestically produced goods. In most U.S. FTAs, and with respect to the countries that have signed up to the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement, this nondiscrimination commitment even extended to government procurement of goods -- meaning that the U.S. government, for example, should not show a preference for U.S.-made cars over foreign cars when buying for the federal fleet. Of course, these agreements also required governments to allow U.S. companies to bid on their procurement contracts.

U.S. FTAs typically included chapters ensuring that FTA partners offered IP protections comparable to U.S. IP protections. Several also sought to codify legal immunity for digital platforms regarding content posted by their users, just as platforms have immunity in the United States from lawsuits over user-posted content. Free data flows generally were protected, and governments made other commitments to not limit the operations of digital platforms operating in their countries. Trade policymakers also regularly touted deal language that promoted workers' rights and environmental standards.

The final chapter of this era of trade policymaking was President Barack Obama's support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal between a dozen economies in the Americas and Asia negotiated by the Obama administration in 2016. The TPP expanded on earlier FTAs from the 2000s and early 2010s, including by developing new disciplines on state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation. But the Obama administration made its case for the TPP largely on geopolitical grounds, arguing that it would be an important economic counterweight to China's influence in the Pacific and an economic pillar of the administration's ""pivot to China.""

Obama signed the TPP in January 2016. But even as he pushed for congressional ratification of the deal, it was becoming clear that the trade paradigm that had dominated Washington policy discussions since the early 1990s was falling out of favor. By late 2015, key congressional leaders had begun to express skepticism of the emerging TPP provisions, and ultimately they never scheduled a vote on the deal. Both of the major presidential candidates in 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton (who had supported the early development of the TPP while serving as Obama's secretary of state) and Republican Donald Trump, opposed the deal on the campaign trail, and Trump withdrew the United States from the deal shortly after his inauguration in 2017. (The other members of the deal, led by Japan, moved forward and completed the deal, rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, in 2018.)

Obama signed the TPP in January 2016. But even as he pushed for congressional ratification of the deal, it was becoming clear that the trade paradigm that had dominated Washington policy discussions since the early 1990s was falling out of favor.

As president, Trump generally eschewed traditional trade deals in favor of a tariff-heavy approach to trade, intended to put pressure on China while protecting U.S. industries, like steel, that he deemed important. Nevertheless, he did successfully enact the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), an overhaul of the NAFTA agreement from twenty-five years earlier. And while some in the trade policy and national security communities hoped that Biden would launch negotiations to reenter the TPP, Biden has instead launched trade initiatives like the IPEF that are intended promote cooperation on trade and standards but do not provide access to the U.S. market as traditional FTAs would. And even without U.S. market access, such initiatives have proved politically controversial. In November 2023, for instance, Biden indefinitely postponed finalization of the trade-related aspects of IPEF owing to concerns by Democrats in Congress that the deal would be politically harmful and due to opposition by American labor unions. Biden also quietly postponed nascent trade talks with the United Kingdom and Kenya that began in the last months of the Trump administration, and late last year his trade representative, Katherine Tai, withdrew long-standing U.S. support for proposed digital trade rules at the WTO. Trump, in his campaign to regain the presidency this year, has doubled down on his commitment to tariffs and other protectionist measures rather than deals, floating the idea of imposing a 60 percent tariff on goods imported from China and a 10 percent tariff on products imported from everywhere else.

Of course, trade has long been a hot-button political issue. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot made his opposition to NAFTA a signature issue in his 1992 independent presidential campaign against Bill Clinton and incumbent George H. W. Bush, and trade deal approvals have always been hard fought in Congress. But for the twenty-five-year period between 1990 and the mid-2010s, geopolitical and economic logic were able to overcome that political opposition to see deals to fruition. Today, there is scant evidence that new trade deals could get through Congress, and a dwindling number of elected political leaders are willing to argue in favor of them. There are several reasons for this change in political support.

Trade has long been a hot-button political issue. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot made his opposition to NAFTA a signature issue in his 1992 independent presidential campaign against Bill Clinton and incumbent George H. W. Bush, and trade deal approvals have always been hard fought in Congress.

The first is the shifting U.S. relationship with China. Although economic research from the 1990s and early 2000s generally found that expanding U.S. trade flows had at most a limited impact on U.S. manufacturing employment, with other factors such as automation playing a larger role, research from the mid- and late 2010s found that the ""China shock"" of growing U.S.-China trade in the 2000s had substantially more disruptive impacts on jobs. Moreover, communities adversely impacted by the China shock have seen little recovery over the past decade. Adverse employment impacts from trade with China, combined with China's rise as a geopolitical competitor, have led to bipartisan support for ""derisking"" U.S. supply chains from China, fueled the arguments of trade skeptics, and renewed a focus on U.S. domestic manufacturing.

The second reason is shifts in domestic political preferences. It is true that some polling shows that the majority of Americans are supportive of trade: a 2023 poll commissioned by the Chicago Council for Global Affairs, for example, found that 74 percent of Americans say ""trade is good for the U.S. economy."" But as prominent economist Alan Blinder pointed out several years ago in Foreign Affairs, ""most Americans' belief in free trade is a mile wide but an inch deep,"" with polling responses varying widely depending on which questions are being asked and whether Americans are asked only about trade in the abstract or also about American manufacturing and jobs.

Trade policy is a classic example of an issue where a constituency that is invested deeply in and affected by an issue, such as specific U.S. industries and workers who face the risk of losses from trade, exert more influence than a majority of voters who may benefit from lower prices but who do not see their well-being as being deeply connected to trade issues. Recent polling by American Compass, a conservative organization that is skeptical of trade deals, has also shown that while a plurality of Americans thinks they personally benefit from globalization, a similar plurality thinks the United States as a whole has been harmed. Other recent polling suggests that on trade, more Americans trust Trump, with his zeal for tariffs, than trust Biden. Academic research, meanwhile, indicates that while Trump's tariffs were an economic mixed bag, they won Republicans votes at the ballot box.

A third reason is that the raw economic benefits of trade deals have become less compelling. Take the TPP as an example: even the Obama administration's own official estimate found that the TPP would add just 0.15 percent to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) after a decade, hardly a compelling economic justification for the deal. And in the years since Trump abandoned the deal, actual U.S. trade flows have still moved in a beneficial direction: China's share of U.S. goods imports declined from a high of over 20 percent in the late 2010s to approximately 15 percent last year, while the absolute value of U.S. goods imports from China fell last year to the lowest level in a decade. Trade with allies and partners also has grown: since 2017, U.S imports of goods from India are up 37 percent, up 80 percent from Indonesia, up 61 percent from the Philippines, and up a whopping 200 percent from Vietnam -- the last of these now exports goods valued at a quarter of its entire GDP to the United States. The United States became India's largest trading partner in 2023, while U.S. exports to the European Union and European imports from the United States are both up more than 25 percent over the past few years. Overall U.S. exports today substantially exceed prepandemic levels, reflecting growing global demand for U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufactured goods, as well as U.S. services.

Meanwhile, Americans traditionally thought to be adversely impacted by trade are doing well. Real wages for lower-income Americans grew strongly in 2023, and, in a reversal of the trend that has prevailed for most of the past two decades, the real wage growth for lower-income Americans over the past two years has been higher than the rate of wage growth for higher-income Americans. Women and Black Americans also saw historic gains in the labor market. A situation where both U.S. companies and U.S. workers are doing well creates little incentive to open U.S. markets to more competition. Numbers like these reinforce skepticism about the benefits of new FTAs.

Americans traditionally thought to be adversely impacted by trade are doing well. Real wages for lower-income Americans grew strongly in 2023.

But perhaps the most important reason for declining U.S. political support for new trade deals is that the economic theory of the case that underpinned the deals of the 1990s to the mid-2010s has fallen out of favor in Washington. At a fundamental level, a bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington that the United States should rebuild its manufacturing industrial base and focus more on the economic well-being of American workers. Irrespective of whether prioritizing manufacturing optimizes American economic growth, there is strong political support for doing so.

In some sectors, U.S. domestic support for reindustrialization is driven by geopolitics: Congress's bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act in 2022, which will provide more than $75 billion in incentives for manufacturing semiconductors in the United States, was driven in part by concern that a conflict between China and Taiwan could cut off America's access to the chips it needs for industrial, defense, and consumer applications. In other sectors, such as manufacturing clean energy technologies, the push for reindustrialization is driven by a combination of geopolitical desires -- ensuring that the United States is not dependent on China for green technologies -- as well as domestic economic interests in boosting manufacturing employment in emerging manufacturing sectors. Across the political aisle, Biden's trade representative Katherine Tai and Trump's former trade representative Robert Lighthizer are united in a view that a goal of trade policy should be to raise wages and well-being for workers and that, for too long, trade policy has focused on benefits to consumers.

At a macroeconomic level, this desire to reindustrialize in many respects runs counter to the economic theory that underpinned many of the major trade deals of the past, which posited that U.S. workers would move up into ""higher value"" sectors like information technology, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing as the United States offshored lower-value (and lower profit margin) types of manufacturing. Moreover, many of the tools that policymakers want to deploy to rebuild manufacturing may run up against the trade rules that the United States long supported. Many of the United States' European and Asian allies, for example, argue that the manufacturing subsidies the United States adopted in the CHIPS Act and particularly the green energy-focused Inflation Reduction Act violate the spirit and likely the letter of provisions of the WTO and U.S. trade agreements that long sought to limit industrial subsidies or at least give countries the right to retaliate against them. Likewise, ""Buy America"" provisions that direct the U.S. government to purchase American-made products run counter to trade rules on government procurement long supported by the United States.

The United States confronts a similar dynamic with respect to policymakers' preferences on technology and the digital economy. Going back to the early days of the internet and continuing through the 2019 U.S.-Japan digital agreement, U.S. trade agreements have sought to promote light-touch regulation of the tech sector, guarantee the free flow of data across borders, and protect tech companies from lawsuits for content posted online. Today, Democrats and Republicans alike are pursuing a much more aggressive regulatory approach to technology companies, including competition policy crackdowns, efforts to repeal companies' immunity for content posted online, and increased restrictions on cross-border data flows, at least to China. Some members of Congress and policy experts in the United States even want to revisit long-standing patent and copyright protections -- such as the Biden administration's current consideration of exercising ""march in rights"" to override patents to reduce drug costs -- arguing that U.S. law has become too protective of intellectual property. The rise of generative AI is also likely to prompt a profound reassessment of intellectual property protections. These shifting domestic preferences, much like America's growing preference for industrial policy, in many ways run counter to provisions historically supported in U.S. trade deals and will require a reassessment and overhaul of the trade rules America pushes for.

Faced with fading support for FTAs, over the past two years trade-focused experts, industry lobbies, and protrade officials in Washington have floated a number of ways to reboot support for trade deals. The most popular approach has been to lean heavily on geopolitical arguments for trade. Commentators and political figures from across the political spectrum have argued that geopolitical competition with China makes trade deals with allies important: a late 2023 report by the bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on China, for example, argued that to compete with China the United States should ""pursue trade agreements with strong rules of origin and high standards,"" and it suggested Taiwan and possibly the United Kingdom and Japan as partners. As the Washington Post put it more succinctly in the title of a 2023 editorial, ""To compete with China, the U.S. should put real trade deals on the table.""

Geopolitics has been the driving argument for the Biden administration's IPEF. As Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at a 2022 launch event, the IPEF ""marks an important turning point in restoring U.S. economic leadership in the region and presenting Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China's approach to these critical issues."" Commentators such as Matthias Dopfner, meanwhile, have argued that Western democratic states should create a democratic trading block that increasingly would align trade policy with values while establishing the type of large economic scale that drives the efficiency gains that have been a long-standing economic argument for trade.

The idea of a broad democratic trading bloc is appealing as a long-term vision. But there is little reason to expect that geopolitical arguments for trade will prevail in the debate -- particularly after they failed both to gain support for the TPP and to prevent Biden from postponing the IPEF trade pillar. The political and policy reality is that, aside from America's robust defense budget, Americans are wary of policies that they perceive as requiring the American taxpayer to pay for the benefit of even other democratic states, as evidenced by the comparatively low levels of U.S. foreign assistance, and, more recently, the sharp congressional debate over continuing U.S. military and economic support to Ukraine. Framing trade deals as a sort of tax the United States should pay to strengthen the democratic world against China and other autocracies is unlikely to be a winning argument in the American heartland without a healthy dose of economic self-interest thrown in as well. Moreover, a number of large emerging market democracies that would be an important part of a democratic trading block, such as India and Brazil, have traditionally pursued protectionists trade policies and seem unlikely to be interested in a broad market liberalization in the near or mid-term.

The idea of a broad democratic trading bloc is appealing as a long-term vision. But there is little reason to expect that geopolitical arguments for trade will prevail in the debate.

A handful of former officials, seeing the political success of the USMCA -- Trump's updated NAFTA -- have argued that the new agreement could be expanded to add additional members, potentially ultimately countries on both sides of the Pacific. But here, too, both the politics and the policies likely would prove challenging. Although there was broad bipartisan support for USMCA, that support reflected the fact that the United States already had a trade deal with Mexico and Canada (NAFTA) and bipartisan recognition that after twenty-five years, elements of NAFTA were in need of an update. Adding more countries, which would de facto result in the United States entering into new agreements with countries that did not have preexisting FTAs, would carry a different and almost certainly more challenging set of political dynamics. Instead, the way to reset the trade agenda is to start by resetting the economic logic of deals. If successful periods of trade policymaking have occurred in the past when the United States saw deals as advancing both its economic and its geopolitical interests, policymakers need deals that work on the economics as well as the geopolitics.

To reset the economics, policymakers should start by thinking less about traditional goals of market liberalization and more about discrete global challenges that require international economic cooperation -- and possible ways of using trade deals to address those challenges. This would almost certainly mean pivoting from a bilateral or regional approach to trade to a sectoral approach to trade that brings together different sets of international partners to address discrete challenges.

To reset the economics, policymakers should start by thinking less about traditional goals of market liberalization and more about discrete global challenges that require international economic cooperation.

Start with climate and energy. Global climate change poses an existential threat, as carbon dioxide emissions hit a new global high in 2023 despite years of international promises to address the problem. The United States accounts for only about 15 percent of total global emissions, whereas traded goods and services account for perhaps 25 percent of global emissions. Trade policy offers a powerful tool to tackle the 85 percent of emissions that originate outside the United States. Meanwhile, many U.S. allies and partners face a near-term challenge of securing their supplies of traditional fossil fuel energy, particularly following Russia's 2022 war on Ukraine. European allies, for example, have had to scramble to find substitutes for Russian oil and gas. Even the United States remains far too dependent on Russia for uranium for nuclear power.

A climate and energy agreement could bring together a group of countries with the technologies and critical materials needed to produce clean energy, such as South Korea on battery technology, Indonesia for critical minerals, and the European Union for its role in clean power. The countries could work together to coordinate clean energy supply chains and industrial policies to promote the adoption and manufacturing of clean energy technologies. They also could commit to technological cooperation on clean energy technologies, with members, for example, offering streamlined permitting for nuclear energy construction from other member states. As with any trade deal, there would be an economic give and take: the United States and Europe, for instance, could offer countries access to incentives for green energy manufacturing in exchange for reliable access to critical inputs produced with high environmental and labor standards.

A climate and energy agreement could bring together a group of countries with the technologies and critical materials needed to produce clean energy.

Meanwhile, the United States and Canada, major producers of traditional fossil fuels, could commit to providing access to fuels such as liquefied natural gas to address near-term energy security needs while the green transition is underway. The United States also could commit to maintaining high tariffs on Chinese clean energy technologies, including Chinese clean energy technologies produced in third countries, leveraging supply chain diversification away from China as an incentive for participation. It might also make efforts to lean heavily on the European Union and other allies to agree to impose similar tariffs on their imports of green energy products, such as electric vehicles (EVs), from China.

Conversely, countries could coordinate so-called carbon border adjustment mechanisms, which impose tariffs on products based on their carbon emissions, to put pressure on nonmember states like China and other highly polluting countries to reduce their emissions as well. Indeed, the United States and Europe are already discussing miniature versions of coordinated trade action for the clean economy. The proposed Global Arrangement for Sustainable Steel and Aluminum would promote trade in low-carbon steel and aluminum products, and proposed agreements on critical minerals would offer foreign battery materials makers some access to U.S. Inflation Reduction Act subsidies. These nascent steps could be bolstered and expanded into a compelling agenda.

A second sectoral area for trade policy focus would be to develop an ""economic security"" arrangement that coordinated industrial policy measures while strengthening supply chains for critical products. Countries such as Germany and Japan have joined the United States in pursuing new industrial policy measures, as in the case of the European CHIPS Act, which provides incentives for semiconductor manufacturing in Europe to match the U.S. version. Although this approach is welcome, in that it will likely spur further global production of important products like green technologies and semiconductors, poorly coordinated industrial policy measures risk triggering global subsidy fights and creating incentives for companies to play governments off against one another in a bid to maximize subsidies beyond those strictly needed to spur a project.

Meanwhile, the United States continues to face significant supply chain risks for other key products, such as medical devices and pharmaceutical ingredients. The production of many pharmaceuticals ingredients and some medical devices is concentrated on China and India. The United States, Europe, Israel, and a number of other countries, however, have a strong interest in resilience. An economic security arrangement could enable like-minded countries to coordinate industrial policy measures and promote supply chain resilience across critical products.

An economic security arrangement could enable like-minded countries to coordinate industrial policy measures and promote supply chain resilience across critical products.

A final area for a sectoral agreement is AI and the digital economy. The United States has already begun to promote shared global standards for AI development through the G7's Hiroshima process. Over time, an AI and digital economy agreement could link G7 political agreements into binding commitments for a larger number of countries to adopt. With respect to the digital economy, such agreements could establish shared standards and rules of managing data flows to strategic competitors, notably China, to prohibitions on government review of source code for apps and software developed in participating countries and expanded access to the digital economy and trusted telecommunications network infrastructure.

Sectoral agreements also would let the United States reconceptualize the tools that are included in a trade agreement. Since the first modern FTA in the 1980s, American trade agreements have focused on reducing tariffs and aligning regulations, generally around American standards. But trade -- the actual exchange of goods and services and the associated economic activity -- depends at least as much on policies and tools outside the scope of these FTAs as it does on FTA provisions: effective infrastructure, streamlined permitting processes, access to capital, and a skilled workforce. It is time for the United States to open the aperture of what a trade agreement can include to bring in a larger set of tools and potential commitments. For example, an AI and digital economy agreement should not be limited to governance and regulatory standards -- it also should include meaningful financial commitments to help developing-world partner countries procure secure Western telecommunications equipment, rather than relying on Chinese suppliers. Similarly, a climate and energy agreement should include commitments to work together on streamlining the permitting process for high-priority projects that require a footprint across participating countries.

National security tools should also be on the table. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and export controls have come to play a far more prominent role in the international economy in recent years. Here, the United States should use trade deals in an offensive rather than defensive manner, for example, using trade deals to lock in commitments by foreign governments to restrict Chinese acquisitions of strategic companies in their countries. But the United States should also use its own national security tools as an incentive. A climate and energy agreement, for example, should promise to whitelist reputable automotive companies from allied nations like Japan for streamlined CFIUS approval, ensuring that they can invest in promising EV and autonomous driving companies in the United States. A digital economy agreement could include commitments not to impose export controls on allies without advance notice and consultation.

Finally, sectoral deals will let the United States focus trade provisions on specific facilities, rather than country of production. When the Trump administration negotiated the USMCA, for example, it included novel provisions that required workers to be paid at least $16 an hour for automotive parts to qualify for USMCA tariff treatment -- essentially meaning that only certain Mexican plants qualify. Sectoral trade agreements are well suited to take this type of approach: a climate and energy agreement, for example, could offer foreign-made electric parts access to some of the subsidies contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, but only for facilities that meet the highest labor and environmental standards.

Sectoral agreements also offer a new set of opportunities -- to reframe trade deals as solving tangible problems that matter to the American people and to the world at large, and to negotiate rules that would internationalize some domestic policy changes within the United States.

Negotiating large sectoral agreements undoubtedly will be challenging, as countries argue over the scope of covered sectors, market access, and the commitments to put on the table. But sectoral agreements also offer a new set of opportunities -- to reframe trade deals as solving tangible problems that matter to the American people and to the world at large, and to negotiate rules that would internationalize some domestic policy changes within the United States.

Of course, a rebooted U.S. trade agenda is not just about deals with allies -- it also requires addressing the U.S. trade relationship with China.

For many years, the strategic paradigm of U.S. trade policy toward China was defined by the hope that economic ties would persuade China to continue on a course of gradual economic and political liberalization. By the mid-2010s, it was clear that this paradigm had failed, prompting Trump to impose sweeping tariffs in a bid to generate negotiating leverage to compel China to change its economic model. China responded to the tariffs, initially with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like agricultural products, and ultimately Trump offered tens of billions of dollars in assistance to U.S. farmers to offset the impacts of Chinese tariffs. Later, China offered a handful of concessions as part of a ""Phase 1"" trade deal, largely to avoid a threatened future tariff escalation. However, China steadfastly refused to make more fundamental changes to its economy and market, and there is no evidence that China's willingness to reform has increased in the years since.

Moreover, even in the unlikely event that China made additional trade concessions to the United States, it is far from clear that they should be accepted: the United States has a strategic interest in reducing its dependencies on China in critical goods irrespective of whether China offers better terms on trade. For example, even if China somehow offered to allow American firms to produce critical minerals or EV batteries in China on fair terms, the United States has a strategic interest in ensuring that its domestic markets are not reliant on those supplies. The United States of course should pursue appropriate, fair terms for trade in nonstrategic goods, but when it comes to critical products, the U.S. objective should be to derisk the relationship, not for American and Chinese firms to compete on a level playing field.

Even in the unlikely event that China made additional trade concessions to the United States, it is far from clear that they should be accepted.

Against that backdrop, the United States should rebalance its China tariffs to prioritize derisking rather than leverage for a deal. For example, it should raise tariffs on products where supply chain vulnerabilities remain acute, like EVs, batteries, medicines, and critical materials, while potentially offering some reductions in tariffs on nonstrategic consumer goods.

Effective derisking will require more than simple tariffs on China, however: it also will require measures to reduce the Chinese content in imports from third countries. There is a growing body of evidence, for example, that some of America's growing imports from Vietnam are of products composed mostly of Chinese components, with low-value finishing work done in Vietnam. The United States needs to revisit the so-called rules of origin that determine what a product's country of origin is for tariff purposes to begin derisking the upstream elements of critical supply chains. It also needs to figure out how to tackle China's dominance in a handful of strategic construction industries, like shipbuilding and port infrastructure, where China's impacts are global.

Though a U.S. pivot to sectoral agreements and more active management of the U.S.-China trade relationship could offer the potential to reboot the U.S. trade agenda, it will draw even more questions from U.S. allies about whether the United States has any residual support for the WTO. The WTO still serves as a basic framework for trade between nearly 200 countries, but the simple, often unspoken reality is that many American policymakers today regard the WTO as an outdated institution that reflects a different geopolitical moment. One of the WTO's core tenets is that countries would accord each other preferential ""most favored nation"" trade status, in that the United States would set similar tariffs for both competitors like China and allies like Germany. With the resurrection of great power geopolitics as a defining feature of international relations, for most American policymakers it makes little sense for the United States to promote a global trading regime. Instead, most U.S. policymakers would prefer to see the development of a U.S.-centered trading bloc or blocs among allies and partners.

That said, most of America's allies remain committed to the WTO, for understandable reasons. As the world's largest economy, the United States is relatively well-positioned to negotiate bilateral or plurilateral agreements with major trading partners. Most small and midsize countries, however, strongly benefit from a stable global trading system rather than having to negotiate hundreds of bespoke agreements. The WTO also offers smaller countries a set of rules they see as being a valuable check on both the protectionist actions of large countries and for smaller countries to manage trade among themselves. The WTO itself, meanwhile, requires consensus for major changes, making reform unlikely. Moreover, a U.S. withdrawal from the WTO would be costly. It would result in more than one hundred countries around the world having the right to impose higher tariffs on the United States. To avoid that outcome, the United States would have to negotiate an unmanageable number of new deals in a short time frame.

The WTO also offers smaller countries a set of rules they see as being a valuable check on both the protectionist actions of large countries and for smaller countries to manage trade among themselves.

Unfortunately, there is no clear path forward to resolve global differences on the WTO, given differences of both interest and opinion between the United States and its partners. The simplest path is likely for the United States and China, or perhaps the G7 on one side and China on the other, to reach a kind of mutual detente in which WTO rules would not actually govern trade between them. In many ways, this scenario would simply codify and expand the existing de facto reality between Washington and Beijing, where both Trump's 2018 tariffs on China and China's retaliation violate WTO rules, but the two governments effectively have reached a mutual understanding on tariff rates that simply exist outside the WTO system. Over the longer term, however, the world may see global trade continue to move toward discrete blocs -- and this trend is already well underway. But there is not yet any international consensus on what a vision for that future would look like.

Of course, for many Americans, and many policymakers, a rational lesson of the past few years could be that American trade policy does not need a reboot. Supply chains are diversifying away from China, U.S. exports are up, and real wages for workers are rising. Even if allies and partners complain about the lack of new American trade deals, rising actual trade volumes and closer defense relationships, like the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal with Australia and the UK and closer U.S. military cooperation with the Philippines, help to strengthen geopolitical ties. And even policymakers who want to use trade deals to strengthen geopolitical relations have to acknowledge that the correlation between economic and geopolitical relations is far from perfect. After all, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 despite decades of European policy aimed at using trade to anchor Russia economically into the West. As Lighthizer told a House committee last year, the iconic rock band the Beatles taught him that ""money can't buy me love"" and that he doubted that ""transferring our wealth to these people is going to make them like us more.""

The best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy.

The strongest argument for rebooting U.S. trade policy ultimately may not be geopolitics, nor even the economic argument that trade deals will help an already-strong U.S economy. Instead, the best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy. For trade policy to advance those goals, and win the domestic support that will be needed to make them happen, it is time to develop a trade policy designed around them.

Sardinia, Italy (CNN) -- He's a World Cup winner, who has won multiple titles with French club Paris Saint-Germain over the last seven years. Now, Kylian MbappÃ©, who is widely expected to imminently join Real Madrid, says he's looking forward to the challenge of playing in a new country.

""I want to be happy,"" MbappÃ© told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies after being crowned Best Men's Player at the inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy, on Tuesday.

""I will leave my country for the first time,"" added MbappÃ©. ""It's going to be an amazing experience and I can't wait to be in my new club. I want to win trophies ... When you speak about football, [it's about] winning trophies, being with new teammates.

""Now, I have my contract with PSG ... Everybody knows that it's soon finishing and we're going to see what happens.""

It was earlier this month that confirmation came that the 25-year-old, who is the second most expensive soccer player in history, wouldn't be extending his stay with French giant PSG.

The first time Real came calling for MbappÃ© was when the forward was just 13 years old. In his comic book, ""Je m'appelle Kylian (I'm called Kylian),"" MbappÃ© describes his dreams of one day playing in the famed white shirt of Los Blancos.

And when Real submitted a $188 million bid for the striker in August 2021 - a deal that was close to being agreed - the Frenchman admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG.

MbappÃ© eventually made a U-turn by signing a three-year contract extension with PSG in May 2022, temporarily pausing one of soccer's biggest transfer sagas.

So was it the right decision to stay in Paris?

""It was more than just staying at PSG. It was the World Cup in Qatar. It was many things around these things. It was a big decision, difficult decision ... but I don't regret anything,"" said MbappÃ©.

""Of course, in a career, you have to take difficult decisions and it's what I did, but I became the all-time top scorer with PSG. I just want to remember the best things ... It was not an easy situation and I wish nobody to live that.""

Real Madrid has long had a history of having some of the game's biggest superstars in its ranks.

The 2000-06 GalÃ¡cticos squad boasted the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo NazÃ¡rio, LuÃ­s Figo and David Beckham, before the second incarnation came in 2009 in the form of record-breaking signings Cristiano Ronaldo and KakÃ¡ - not to mention signing a young Karim Benzema from Lyon.

The young Frenchman seems to have been earmarked as the player to headline a new wave of star power alongside the likes of VinÃ­cius Jr. and Jude Bellingham. Those two players will be bidding to help Real win a record-extending 15th European Cup on Saturday when Los Merengues face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final in London's Wembley Stadium.

Will MbappÃ© be cheering on his prospective new employer and teammates?

""No - I'll just watch the final like you,"" he smiled. ""When you love football, you watch every game. I watch every game when I can ... in France, England, Spain, Germany, Italy. Every league. So, of course, I'm going to watch the Champions League.""

Champions League glory has so far eluded MbappÃ© in what is otherwise an astounding trophy-laden career. The closest he and PSG got was the 2020 final in Lisbon, when the team lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich.

""I think it's part of the journey,"" he says. ""I have, of course, many opportunities more to win the Champions League, but I think it's part of your destiny.

""We were close a few times ... It's part of the game. Now, I'm in the position that I only want to have good feelings, good memories about my journey in Paris and everything that happened in this club and don't forget about the small details.""

Paris is where MbappÃ© the boy became MbappÃ© the man.

After leaving AS Monaco as a fresh-faced 18-year-old, the superstar has achieved numerous individual and team accolades with PSG. He leaves the French capital having won six Ligue 1 titles, four French Cups, two League Cups and a record five Player of the Year awards.

And, on top of that, he's a World Cup winner.

""If I'm the player who I am now ... I have to thank PSG,"" said MbappÃ©. ""When I arrived there [at 18], I was just a young guy who wanted to be someone in world football.

""I did one year in Monaco. Of course, it was great. We won the league and went to the semifinal of the Champions [League], but I did nothing important in the world of football.

""[PSG was] an amazing opportunity. I'm French, I'm from Paris, so it was something special. Seven years ... That's a lot in a career, even more in modern football ... It was a special feeling for me to be part of this club.""

While some will judge his career in terms of goals, trophies and accolades, MbappÃ© sees his imprint on the sport in a bigger, historical perspective.

""I have a lot of things to give to football,"" he said. ""I've done many things, but I'm still young and I want to do more ... I want to put my name in the history of football.

""I just watch what I have in the future, and I want to really improve my game, to be a better player every year and to be the player who I want to be.

""It's not just about goals, not just about trophies, it's about the feeling that you give to people, the emotion, and the way you can be a complete player, the way you can help your teammates to be better.

""I want to understand more the game, more the world of football, everything. I have more experience so that's helped me to be better.""

""It was more than just staying at PSG. It was the World Cup in Qatar. It was many things around these things. It was a big decision, difficult decision ... but I don't regret anything,"" said MbappÃ©.

""Of course, in a career, you have to take difficult decisions and it's what I did, but I became the all-time top scorer with PSG. I just want to remember the best things ... It was not an easy situation and I wish nobody to live that.""

Real Madrid has long had a history of having some of the game's biggest superstars in its ranks.

The 2000-06 GalÃ¡cticos squad boasted the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo NazÃ¡rio, LuÃ­s Figo and David Beckham, before the second incarnation came in 2009 in the form of record-breaking signings Cristiano Ronaldo and KakÃ¡ - not to mention signing a young Karim Benzema from Lyon.

The young Frenchman seems to have been earmarked as the player to headline a new wave of star power alongside the likes of VinÃ­cius Jr. and Jude Bellingham. Those two players will be bidding to help Real win a record-extending 15th European Cup on Saturday when Los Merengues face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final in London's Wembley Stadium.

Will MbappÃ© be cheering on his prospective new employer and teammates?

""No - I'll just watch the final like you,"" he smiled. ""When you love football, you watch every game. I watch every game when I can ... in France, England, Spain, Germany, Italy. Every league. So, of course, I'm going to watch the Champions League.""

Champions League glory has so far eluded MbappÃ© in what is otherwise an astounding trophy-laden career. The closest he and PSG got was the 2020 final in Lisbon, when the team lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich.

""I think it's part of the journey,"" he says. ""I have, of course, many opportunities more to win the Champions League, but I think it's part of your destiny.

""We were close a few times ... It's part of the game. Now, I'm in the position that I only want to have good feelings, good memories about my journey in Paris and everything that happened in this club and don't forget about the small details.""

Paris is where MbappÃ© the boy became MbappÃ© the man.

After leaving AS Monaco as a fresh-faced 18-year-old, the superstar has achieved numerous individual and team accolades with PSG. He leaves the French capital having won six Ligue 1 titles, four French Cups, two League Cups and a record five Player of the Year awards.

And, on top of that, he's a World Cup winner.

""If I'm the player who I am now ... I have to thank PSG,"" said MbappÃ©. ""When I arrived there [at 18], I was just a young guy who wanted to be someone in world football.

""I did one year in Monaco. Of course, it was great. We won the league and went to the semifinal of the Champions [League], but I did nothing important in the world of football.

""[PSG was] an amazing opportunity. I'm French, I'm from Paris, so it was something special. Seven years ... That's a lot in a career, even more in modern football ... It was a special feeling for me to be part of this club.""

While some will judge his career in terms of goals, trophies and accolades, MbappÃ© sees his imprint on the sport in a bigger, historical perspective.

""I have a lot of things to give to football,"" he said. ""I've done many things, but I'm still young and I want to do more ... I want to put my name in the history of football.

""I just watch what I have in the future, and I want to really improve my game, to be a better player every year and to be the player who I want to be.

""It's not just about goals, not just about trophies, it's about the feeling that you give to people, the emotion, and the way you can be a complete player, the way you can help your teammates to be better.

Sardinia, Italy (CNN) -- He's a World Cup winner, who has won multiple titles with French club Paris Saint-Germain over the last seven years. Now, Kylian MbappÃ©, who is widely expected to imminently join Real Madrid, says he's looking forward to the challenge of playing in a new country.

""I want to be happy,"" MbappÃ© told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies after being crowned Best Men's Player at the inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy, on Tuesday.

""I will leave my country for the first time,"" added MbappÃ©. ""It's going to be an amazing experience and I can't wait to be in my new club. I want to win trophies ... When you speak about football, [it's about] winning trophies, being with new teammates.

""Now, I have my contract with PSG ... Everybody knows that it's soon finishing and we're going to see what happens.""

It was earlier this month that confirmation came that the 25-year-old, who is the second most expensive soccer player in history, wouldn't be extending his stay with French giant PSG.

The first time Real came calling for MbappÃ© was when the forward was just 13 years old. In his comic book, ""Je m'appelle Kylian (I'm called Kylian),"" MbappÃ© describes his dreams of one day playing in the famed white shirt of Los Blancos.

And when Real submitted a $188 million bid for the striker in August 2021 - a deal that was close to being agreed - the Frenchman admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG.

MbappÃ© eventually made a U-turn by signing a three-year contract extension with PSG in May 2022, temporarily pausing one of soccer's biggest transfer sagas.

So was it the right decision to stay in Paris?

""It was more than just staying at PSG. It was the World Cup in Qatar. It was many things around these things. It was a big decision, difficult decision ... but I don't regret anything,"" said MbappÃ©.

""Of course, in a career, you have to take difficult decisions and it's what I did, but I became the all-time top scorer with PSG. I just want to remember the best things ... It was not an easy situation and I wish nobody to live that.""

Real Madrid has long had a history of having some of the game's biggest superstars in its ranks.

The 2000-06 GalÃ¡cticos squad boasted the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo NazÃ¡rio, LuÃ­s Figo and David Beckham, before the second incarnation came in 2009 in the form of record-breaking signings Cristiano Ronaldo and KakÃ¡ - not to mention signing a young Karim Benzema from Lyon.

The young Frenchman seems to have been earmarked as the player to headline a new wave of star power alongside the likes of VinÃ­cius Jr. and Jude Bellingham. Those two players will be bidding to help Real win a record-extending 15th European Cup on Saturday when Los Merengues face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final in London's Wembley Stadium.

Will MbappÃ© be cheering on his prospective new employer and teammates?

""No - I'll just watch the final like you,"" he smiled. ""When you love football, you watch every game. I watch every game when I can ... in France, England, Spain, Germany, Italy. Every league. So, of course, I'm going to watch the Champions League.""

Champions League glory has so far eluded MbappÃ© in what is otherwise an astounding trophy-laden career. The closest he and PSG got was the 2020 final in Lisbon, when the team lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich.

""I think it's part of the journey,"" he says. ""I have, of course, many opportunities more to win the Champions League, but I think it's part of your destiny.

""We were close a few times ... It's part of the game. Now, I'm in the position that I only want to have good feelings, good memories about my journey in Paris and everything that happened in this club and don't forget about the small details.""

Paris is where MbappÃ© the boy became MbappÃ© the man.

After leaving AS Monaco as a fresh-faced 18-year-old, the superstar has achieved numerous individual and team accolades with PSG. He leaves the French capital having won six Ligue 1 titles, four French Cups, two League Cups and a record five Player of the Year awards.

And, on top of that, he's a World Cup winner.

""If I'm the player who I am now ... I have to thank PSG,"" said MbappÃ©. ""When I arrived there [at 18], I was just a young guy who wanted to be someone in world football.

""I did one year in Monaco. Of course, it was great. We won the league and went to the semifinal of the Champions [League], but I did nothing important in the world of football.

""[PSG was] an amazing opportunity. I'm French, I'm from Paris, so it was something special. Seven years ... That's a lot in a career, even more in modern football ... It was a special feeling for me to be part of this club.""

While some will judge his career in terms of goals, trophies and accolades, MbappÃ© sees his imprint on the sport in a bigger, historical perspective.

""I have a lot of things to give to football,"" he said. ""I've done many things, but I'm still young and I want to do more ... I want to put my name in the history of football.

""I just watch what I have in the future, and I want to really improve my game, to be a better player every year and to be the player who I want to be.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

You might well be surveying London-wide theatre listings but this is the singular programme at Dailes theatre in Riga, Latvia's capital where, alongside some American heavyweights, British talents are at the forefront this season.

Among them are writer-director Jeff James and designer Rosanna Vize with an eye-popping version of The Winter's Tale, commissioned by Dailes's artistic director, Viesturs KairiÅ¡s. It opens with Hermione pleasuring herself to VR porn, reimagines Bohemia as a deadly video game and turns theatre's most famous stage direction into the supporting character of a hot-headed panda.

Time's ""swift passage"" speech, fast-forwarding 16 years in the plot, is just about all that remains from the original text, although Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (""Let me not to the marriage of true minds"") is shrewdly added and complemented by a scene featuring Leonard Cohen's Treaty (""I wish there was a treaty / between your love and mine""). It ends with a full ensemble jig to BeyoncÃ©'s Texas Hold 'Em. Did I mention the nuptials are officiated by a banana avatar?

""What I am doing would be illegal in the UK,"" says James with a laugh, a couple of hours before the show's premiere on a sweltering May evening. Completely rewriting Shakespeare could well be met with frosty suspicion at home. Never mind setting half the play inside a video game filmed with characters wearing ""beautiful, insane, faux heads"" and shown on a huge screen which mostly obscures the stage actors who stomp around behind, their oversized red boots poking out underneath.

""These are quite obviously distancing effects,"" he deadpans. ""But I would say that even these effects in combination are not as distancing as performing The Winter's Tale in the original Shakespearean verse. I think that is the ultimate alienation effect. To take the story and structure of the play and find a kind of contemporary language and world for it, makes the play - I hope - much more immediate to an audience today."" It is an often daft yet clever and ultimately moving evening, which knowingly toys with the risible elements of the original play yet honours its delicate blend of hope and regret.

Vize has designed an office playground in pink and yellow to suit this play about injured innocence and a childish tyrant. The Silicon Valley company AppZapp is ruled by billionaire boss Leo (the Leontes role) who has built a Bohemia metaverse, where baby Rose will be spirited away. Everyone is in disguise in Shakespeare's Bohemia, James points out. ""I thought: where do people go today and appear to be someone they are not? The internet.""

The trial runs for Leo's game have led to the deaths of several players, ratcheting up his trepidation and helping to explain his suspicion that Hermione is having an affair - something directors often have to work hard to establish. James, who happened to be expecting a second child with his partner while writing the script, was interested less in Leontes's sexual jealousy than in the character's anxiety about having another child. ""I thought, is there a story here of birth trauma and postnatal depression, and a really complex shared experience that Hermione and Leontes had?"" It is this fear that ultimately leads Leo to accuse Hermione of infidelity. ""If you've got someone who is shaping the whole world through their technologies, and has staggering wealth, what could a man like that do if he had this mistaken idea?""

How did KairiÅ¡s react to James's suggestion that he totally rewrite the play? ""He said 'you can do whatever the fuck you like',"" laughs James, who got the gig after being recommended by Ivo van Hove, with whom he worked as an associate director on several productions. Directors may be given greater power outside the UK, James says, ""but therefore you have more responsibility, as Spider-Man tells us! So they will go with your idea, but it's on you whether it lives or dies.""

Vize, who is preparing for collaborations in Sweden next year with director Maria Aberg, says that we tend to simplify a contrast between how theatre is made in the UK and the rest of Europe. ""It seems to me that every theatre in every European city, even separately from the others in that city, have a different sort of style.""

Dailes has an ensemble of 40 actors on staff, boasts Latvia's biggest stage (""wider than the Lyttelton, basically the same as the Coliseum [in London]"" says James) and receives substantial state funding. ""They need big shows. They do not want a three-hander. Viesturs basically said the more of our actors you can use the better because we want them to be used and they want the work."" In the UK, by contrast, the conversation is more often about how few actors you could get away with using.

James recognised a chance to create something on a bigger scale than he had ever been offered in the UK, where he has worked at venues including the Royal Exchange in Manchester and Nottingham Playhouse. He and Vize say it has been an empowering experience. For Vize, that is ironically partly down to the language barrier. ""The actors speak English, and the heads of the workshops do, but the actual people building and painting and sewing, they don't really. And it forces you to properly know what it is that you want to make ... I need to hand something over that doesn't require language to express it. That pushed me to be more decisive. I think you then find yourself in a conceptually stronger place.""

When he invited Vize to design the set and costumes, James said: ""We have to go big or go home ... we can use this opportunity to make something as exciting as we can possibly imagine."" Brexit does not seem to have hindered the enterprise. The creative team includes their British contemporaries - dramaturg James Yeatman, composer Kieran Lucas, lighting designer Adam Silverman - as well as video artist Jakub Lech from Poland and Latvian choreographer ElÄ«na GediÅa. Kintija Rogers, who translated James's script into Latvian, often joined rehearsals to continue fine-tuning. Several performances will have English surtitles - KairiÅ¡s suggests that one day they will be standard for every show.

At Dailes, a show will first be programmed for a handful of performances and its reception determines how long it stays in the repertoire. (Its biggest current hit is Anka Herbut's Rotkho, which reflects on authenticity in the art world and is directed by Lukasz Twarkowski.) There is not the immediate pressure to sell a long run of performances and there is also no preview system like the UK's; the show opens after two dress rehearsals which are available to the public. Having a permanent acting ensemble and their own workshop allows the theatre to take more risks, James suggests, as they are not hiring freelance cast and creatives for each production.

What else is different here? A better range of desserts on offer to audiences, a longer interval - all the more time to eat them - and the procedure for taking a bow, they explain. Also, much to Vize's delight, there are rarely dirty fingerprints left on her set. A stage cleaner regularly steps in during rehearsals. ""It's like an amazing sort of perfectionist dream.""

James and Vize say the pay is far greater than they are used to at home as Dailes is so well supported by the government; the subsidy it receives could pretty much cover the whole acting ensemble's salaries, explains KairiÅ¡s. Both MÄrtiÅÅ¡ Meiers (who plays Leo) and Madara ViÄ¼Äuka (who plays Rose as a teenager) are new to the ensemble. ViÄ¼Äuka has balanced her heart-wrenching Shakespearean role with some British-style farce courtesy of Peter Pan Goes Wrong, one of two Mischief Theatre comedies produced at Dailes this season. She also appeared in The Night of the Shining Princess by Latvian playwright Rainis (""he's our Shakespeare"") and Leopoldstadt directed by Malkovich, who has himself performed at the Dailes and hailed the ensemble as terrifically talented.

Meiers says he has found his roles ""extraordinarily demanding"", physically and emotionally. The pair agree it has been a rollercoaster start but that the ensemble quickly felt like family. ViÄ¼Äuka says that, as an actor, ""you can fool a lot of people, even sometimes lie to yourself, but when you're in a company working with the same people for years they know you - and know when you are fooling yourself. They'll tell you."" There is also a Latvian tradition of newer actors being assigned ""godparents"", Meiers explains: ""Someone you can talk to who will have a different perspective - actors are doubtful creatures.""

Big houses with ensembles still dominate the country's theatre culture but nimble, smaller independent companies are emerging. Meiers says that getting a placement in a repertory theatre after training used to be vital for a stage actor, but that's not quite the case any more.

In the past, the sheer size of the Dailes theatre has daunted some. Meiers says it makes or breaks young directors: ""It requires some sort of extraordinary talent to fill this space."" James ""had a precise vision"" of the story he wanted to tell, he adds.

""We've never had anything like this on the Latvian stage,"" KairiÅ¡s says of the audacious production. When he took over at the venue in 2020, he decided to showcase rising creative talent from across Europe rather than host established international megastars such as Van Hove. He likens it to a football club signing players: they don't have the deep pockets of the Bundesliga's Bayern Munich but are more like Borussia Dortmund, fielding future legends. He is also developing work with another of Van Hove's British associate directors, Daniel Raggett.

Dailes's internationalism helps to distinguish it from Riga's other venues which include Latvia's National theatre and the Mikhail Chekhov Riga Russian theatre, where KairiÅ¡s recently directed Hamlet: Wartime Chronicle, drawing a parallel between the war in Ukraine and the relationship between ""brother nations"" Denmark and Norway. ""We must be a real European theatre,"" he says of Dailes. ""We must sell European ideas to society because of Russia propaganda ... we still must fight for Europe, somehow.""

With opening night over, James boards a flight home the next day and - in another key cultural contrast - it turns out the actors will soon be leaving the theatre too. ""When the sun is shining, the tickets don't sell as well,"" says ViÄ¼Äuka. Winter's Tale will pause for summer along with most of the repetory. But in cooler weather, the actors will re-enter with that panda in hot pursuit.",ca.style.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!,,0.3333333333333333,454497062,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/d7fbe725cdc30768486f6d1bcb1e6fd5,

Among them are writer-director Jeff James and designer Rosanna Vize with an eye-popping version of The Winter's Tale, commissioned by Dailes's artistic director, Viesturs KairiÅ¡s. It opens with Hermione pleasuring herself to VR porn, reimagines Bohemia as a deadly video game and turns theatre's most famous stage direction into the supporting character of a hot-headed panda.

Time's ""swift passage"" speech, fast-forwarding 16 years in the plot, is just about all that remains from the original text, although Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (""Let me not to the marriage of true minds"") is shrewdly added and complemented by a scene featuring Leonard Cohen's Treaty (""I wish there was a treaty / between your love and mine""). It ends with a full ensemble jig to BeyoncÃ©'s Texas Hold 'Em. Did I mention the nuptials are officiated by a banana avatar?

""What I am doing would be illegal in the UK,"" says James with a laugh, a couple of hours before the show's premiere on a sweltering May evening. Completely rewriting Shakespeare could well be met with frosty suspicion at home. Never mind setting half the play inside a video game filmed with characters wearing ""beautiful, insane, faux heads"" and shown on a huge screen which mostly obscures the stage actors who stomp around behind, their oversized red boots poking out underneath.

""These are quite obviously distancing effects,"" he deadpans. ""But I would say that even these effects in combination are not as distancing as performing The Winter's Tale in the original Shakespearean verse. I think that is the ultimate alienation effect. To take the story and structure of the play and find a kind of contemporary language and world for it, makes the play - I hope - much more immediate to an audience today."" It is an often daft yet clever and ultimately moving evening, which knowingly toys with the risible elements of the original play yet honours its delicate blend of hope and regret.

Vize has designed an office playground in pink and yellow to suit this play about injured innocence and a childish tyrant. The Silicon Valley company AppZapp is ruled by billionaire boss Leo (the Leontes role) who has built a Bohemia metaverse, where baby Rose will be spirited away. Everyone is in disguise in Shakespeare's Bohemia, James points out. ""I thought: where do people go today and appear to be someone they are not? The internet.""

The trial runs for Leo's game have led to the deaths of several players, ratcheting up his trepidation and helping to explain his suspicion that Hermione is having an affair - something directors often have to work hard to establish. James, who happened to be expecting a second child with his partner while writing the script, was interested less in Leontes's sexual jealousy than in the character's anxiety about having another child. ""I thought, is there a story here of birth trauma and postnatal depression, and a really complex shared experience that Hermione and Leontes had?"" It is this fear that ultimately leads Leo to accuse Hermione of infidelity. ""If you've got someone who is shaping the whole world through their technologies, and has staggering wealth, what could a man like that do if he had this mistaken idea?""

How did KairiÅ¡s react to James's suggestion that he totally rewrite the play? ""He said 'you can do whatever the fuck you like',"" laughs James, who got the gig after being recommended by Ivo van Hove, with whom he worked as an associate director on several productions. Directors may be given greater power outside the UK, James says, ""but therefore you have more responsibility, as Spider-Man tells us! So they will go with your idea, but it's on you whether it lives or dies.""

Vize, who is preparing for collaborations in Sweden next year with director Maria Aberg, says that we tend to simplify a contrast between how theatre is made in the UK and the rest of Europe. ""It seems to me that every theatre in every European city, even separately from the others in that city, have a different sort of style.""

Dailes has an ensemble of 40 actors on staff, boasts Latvia's biggest stage (""wider than the Lyttelton, basically the same as the Coliseum [in London]"" says James) and receives substantial state funding. ""They need big shows. They do not want a three-hander. Viesturs basically said the more of our actors you can use the better because we want them to be used and they want the work."" In the UK, by contrast, the conversation is more often about how few actors you could get away with using.

James recognised a chance to create something on a bigger scale than he had ever been offered in the UK, where he has worked at venues including the Royal Exchange in Manchester and Nottingham Playhouse. He and Vize say it has been an empowering experience. For Vize, that is ironically partly down to the language barrier. ""The actors speak English, and the heads of the workshops do, but the actual people building and painting and sewing, they don't really. And it forces you to properly know what it is that you want to make ... I need to hand something over that doesn't require language to express it. That pushed me to be more decisive. I think you then find yourself in a conceptually stronger place.""

When he invited Vize to design the set and costumes, James said: ""We have to go big or go home ... we can use this opportunity to make something as exciting as we can possibly imagine."" Brexit does not seem to have hindered the enterprise. The creative team includes their British contemporaries - dramaturg James Yeatman, composer Kieran Lucas, lighting designer Adam Silverman - as well as video artist Jakub Lech from Poland and Latvian choreographer ElÄ«na GediÅa. Kintija Rogers, who translated James's script into Latvian, often joined rehearsals to continue fine-tuning. Several performances will have English surtitles - KairiÅ¡s suggests that one day they will be standard for every show.

At Dailes, a show will first be programmed for a handful of performances and its reception determines how long it stays in the repertoire. (Its biggest current hit is Anka Herbut's Rotkho, which reflects on authenticity in the art world and is directed by Lukasz Twarkowski.) There is not the immediate pressure to sell a long run of performances and there is also no preview system like the UK's; the show opens after two dress rehearsals which are available to the public. Having a permanent acting ensemble and their own workshop allows the theatre to take more risks, James suggests, as they are not hiring freelance cast and creatives for each production.

What else is different here? A better range of desserts on offer to audiences, a longer interval - all the more time to eat them - and the procedure for taking a bow, they explain. Also, much to Vize's delight, there are rarely dirty fingerprints left on her set. A stage cleaner regularly steps in during rehearsals. ""It's like an amazing sort of perfectionist dream.""

James and Vize say the pay is far greater than they are used to at home as Dailes is so well supported by the government; the subsidy it receives could pretty much cover the whole acting ensemble's salaries, explains KairiÅ¡s. Both MÄrtiÅÅ¡ Meiers (who plays Leo) and Madara ViÄ¼Äuka (who plays Rose as a teenager) are new to the ensemble. ViÄ¼Äuka has balanced her heart-wrenching Shakespearean role with some British-style farce courtesy of Peter Pan Goes Wrong, one of two Mischief Theatre comedies produced at Dailes this season. She also appeared in The Night of the Shining Princess by Latvian playwright Rainis (""he's our Shakespeare"") and Leopoldstadt directed by Malkovich, who has himself performed at the Dailes and hailed the ensemble as terrifically talented.

Meiers says he has found his roles ""extraordinarily demanding"", physically and emotionally. The pair agree it has been a rollercoaster start but that the ensemble quickly felt like family. ViÄ¼Äuka says that, as an actor, ""you can fool a lot of people, even sometimes lie to yourself, but when you're in a company working with the same people for years they know you - and know when you are fooling yourself. They'll tell you."" There is also a Latvian tradition of newer actors being assigned ""godparents"", Meiers explains: ""Someone you can talk to who will have a different perspective - actors are doubtful creatures.""

Big houses with ensembles still dominate the country's theatre culture but nimble, smaller independent companies are emerging. Meiers says that getting a placement in a repertory theatre after training used to be vital for a stage actor, but that's not quite the case any more.

In the past, the sheer size of the Dailes theatre has daunted some. Meiers says it makes or breaks young directors: ""It requires some sort of extraordinary talent to fill this space."" James ""had a precise vision"" of the story he wanted to tell, he adds.

""We've never had anything like this on the Latvian stage,"" KairiÅ¡s says of the audacious production. When he took over at the venue in 2020, he decided to showcase rising creative talent from across Europe rather than host established international megastars such as Van Hove. He likens it to a football club signing players: they don't have the deep pockets of the Bundesliga's Bayern Munich but are more like Borussia Dortmund, fielding future legends. He is also developing work with another of Van Hove's British associate directors, Daniel Raggett.

Dailes's internationalism helps to distinguish it from Riga's other venues which include Latvia's National theatre and the Mikhail Chekhov Riga Russian theatre, where KairiÅ¡s recently directed Hamlet: Wartime Chronicle, drawing a parallel between the war in Ukraine and the relationship between ""brother nations"" Denmark and Norway. ""We must be a real European theatre,"" he says of Dailes. ""We must sell European ideas to society because of Russia propaganda ... we still must fight for Europe, somehow.""

With opening night over, James boards a flight home the next day and - in another key cultural contrast - it turns out the actors will soon be leaving the theatre too. ""When the sun is shining, the tickets don't sell as well,"" says ViÄ¼Äuka. Winter's Tale will pause for summer along with most of the repetory. But in cooler weather, the actors will re-enter with that panda in hot pursuit.",theguardian.com,news,The Guardian,Chris Wiegand,0.3176470588235294,454496621,1,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c1acfbd7ad3a6e06f35f48abb8f9b96d4043e57/0_39_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d847c501bc827355c2aad40a88ef92a6,

Two million liters of water are needed to extract 1,000 kilos of lithium. Researchers are urgently searching for substitutes that are abundant, renewable, biodegradable, safe, low-cost and with little environmental impact. The solution may be near: sodium and calcium, two abundant elements that are being investigated to prevent lithium demand from multiplying by 60 in two decades, according to European Union forecasts.

Added to the unstoppable proliferation of home and portable devices are the two biggest challenges facing society: the electrification of mobility and the storage of renewable energy to provide continuous power. ""There are not enough lithium, cobalt and nickel ions to satisfy everyone's needs,"" says John Abou-Rjeily, a researcher at the company Tiamat Energy, which emerged from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS ) and which designs and manufactures sodium-ion batteries.

As reported in the UE's Horizon magazine, this doctor in Physics and Chemistry of Materials is investigating the possibilities of sodium, one of the most abundant chemical elements in the Earth's crust, and which is safer and cheaper to process than lithium. On the downside, it requires more space, which is why current batteries are not yet suitable for very small devices.

They also cannot compete with the range that current storage systems bring to electric cars, but they could serve as alternatives on shorter routes, which account for the majority of car trips. ""While I would never challenge the 500-kilometer range of lithium-ion batteries, this type of sodium-ion could be more competitive for short and medium distances by car, explains Abou-Rjeily.

Researchers from the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) and Delaware University (United States) are working along the same lines, according to a study published in Energy. ""There is a tendency to demand a really large battery. But according to research, generally, a slightly smaller one, with less range than that of a gasoline tank, is sufficient, since the only time in which you would need a greater autonomy is for a trip of six hours or more, in which case, the driver could charge on the go. There is too much emphasis on the need for a really long range and this leads to an increase in the price of the vehicle and a greater use of resources for electric cars,"" says Frances Sprei, a professor at Chalmers.

For this doctor in Energy and Environment, this change in mentality is necessary to adapt charging facilities where people spend the most time: at home and at work. Sprei regrets that, on the contrary, many European countries focus on the charging network on roads.

This simple modification of the perception of needs would further promote sodium as an alternative, since it would allow the technology to be deployed in homes and workplaces as energy storage systems from renewable sources. This is the goal pursued by Magdalena Graczyk-Zajac, a visiting professor at the Technical University Darmstadt in Germany, and member of the European SIMBA project, a EU-funded initiative to develop a sodium-ion battery for homes which concludes its first phase next June.

This researcher is committed to finding ways to store the energy captured by home photovoltaic panels in a rechargeable sodium ion domestic battery. This would power the homes and charge the electric vehicles of its residents with a significant cost reduction. ""You could be driving your car for free for eight to nine months of the year,"" she says. A prototype is already in laboratory tests.

One part of the battery, the anode, is made from hard carbon, which can be manufactured from wood or biowaste. Another, the cathode, can be made of a material called Prussian white, a chemical compound from a blue pigment of the same name, but with more sodium and rich in iron, one of the most abundant metals.

The Basque research center CIC energiGUNE has its own development in this area: a sodium metal anode with a thickness of only seven microns (70 times thinner than the current ones) achieved through a physical evaporation process. According to this center, the advance opens the door to the manufacture of flexible solid-state batteries with the thin sodium anode, a safer, cheaper and smaller alternative to the current batteries with liquid electrolyte in which graphite is used.

""Sodium cannot be easily laminated due to its sticky texture, similar to plasticine,"" explains Montse GalcerÃ¡n, the principal researcher of this project. ""To date, the most common method used to roll a block of sodium was as basic as processing it with a hammer, but this meant that a thin and homogeneous sheet could not be obtained, and, therefore, there was a large excess of unused sodium in the batteries. Thanks to evaporation, we have managed to overcome that obstacle,"" she says.

This thinning of the anode allows researchers to reduce the amount of sodium needed, as well as the costs, weight and dimensions of the batteries, while increasing energy density (greater storage capacity) and safety.

Another element that is used as a substitute for lithium is calcium. ""It is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust and it is not concentrated in specific geographic areas, as is the case with lithium. If the raw material is cheap, the batteries can also be cheap,"" says Rosa PalacÃ­n, from the Institute of Materials Science of Barcelona (ICMAB-CSIC) and a member of the CARBAT project.

Using calcium as a negative electrode offers advantages over graphite in lithium-ion batteries, since it has a greater accumulation capacity per kilogram (energy density) than conventional lithium batteries, which also form tiny rigid structures called dendrites and can cause short circuits or explode after many uses, according to this institution.

""When calcium passes through the electrolyte, two electrons flow out, instead of one, as in the case of lithium. It can be assumed that a battery of the same size would offer greater autonomy if used in an electric vehicle, as long as a suitable positive electrode is found,"" explains PalacÃ­n.

The key is choosing the most appropriate components. ""It appears that ultimately all working electrolyte salts contain boron. We use calcium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in a mixture of ethylene and propylene carbonate,"" says the researcher.

Other researchers from the Technical University of Denmark are searching, as part of the SALBAGE project, for a battery made from an aluminum anode and a sulfur cathode. Aluminum is even more abundant than calcium, but incorporating it into a battery poses similar difficulties.

""All the materials used are cheap. Aluminum, sulfur, the electrolyte itself and urea are very, very cheap. Even the polymer is,"" says the researcher Juan Lastra, who defends this option to store energy from a wind or solar park.",english.elpais.com,news,EL PAÃS,RaÃºl LimÃ³n,0.1529411764705881,454277955,3,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/3SSHVIOBEEQ7FKJOWQN6LSLCOM.jpg?auth=9d3787c66a540268283208b5d7b8518f1e588837c174c4e97934f16f4f450e4a&width=1200,

It would appear that the Cold War is upon us again! However, seen from another perspective, there are some signs of revival in the relationship. For instance, the US has announced phase IV of its missile defence deployment, which moves missiles away from targeting Russia. After the Boston bombings, Moscow and Washington have been cooperating more intensely on counter terrorism. There has also been an exchange of letters between President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin and the two countries have announced a US-Russia summit in Moscow in September this year. Putin's downplaying of the Snowden affair and warning him against any actions that would hurt the US is also a sign of Russia's willingness to cooperate with Washington. No doubt, the US-Russia relationship is awash with contradictions. This paper attempts to explore these contradictions through a study of their bilateral interactions on various issues such as counter-terrorism, Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, missile and nuclear issues and human rights. It also examines the impact of domestic politics on their bilateral relationship.

After Obama took over as President, he tried to 'reset' the US-Russia relationship. One of the key components of this strategy was the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which mandates reductions in nuclear arms by 2018. That the Russians agreed to reduce their stockpile of nuclear arms was a significant victory for Obama. However, Moscow and Washington have not yet been able to reach an agreement on ballistic missile defence. Russia has for long been concerned about NATO's expansion to Eastern Europe as well as its plans to set up Ballistic Missile Defense systems in countries like Poland, ostensibly against attacks from Iran and North Korea. Moreover, Moscow worries that the US missile defence programme could drive China to strengthen its offensive nuclear forces capability1, which would have security consequences for Russia. Russia has, therefore, demanded legally binding guarantees from the US and NATO that these systems would not be used against it -- but so far to no avail. However, the announcement in March this year by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to scrap the final phase of the European missile defence system might somewhat assuage Russian grievances and open the way for fresh talks on nuclear arms control negotiations. Russian scholars also believe that this is a ""window of opportunity"" and it is now time for serious negotiations between Russia and the US to ""reach compromise agreements that will respond to each country's security interests and strengthen strategic stability"".2

Although Russia has refused to extend the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program which dismantles and safeguards nuclear and chemical weapons in the areas under the former USSR, the good news is that the two countries have announced that they will sign an agreement which will secure and destroy nuclear materials and prevent their spread. The agreement, however, does not include biological or chemical weapons which were covered under the Nunn-Lugar CTR program. Further, President Obama has called for reducing deployed American strategic nuclear warheads by a third if Russia agrees to do the same. While Russia's response to this announcement has not been enthusiastic so far, it will be interesting to see how matters play out in this regard.

Counter-terrorism

The US and Russia share concerns about global terrorism and have worked together on this issue. The Boston bombings opened up an opportunity for the two countries to work together on counter-terrorism. There is a recognition in the US that perhaps the bombings could have been thwarted if the US and Russia had cooperated more on terrorism. Russia had shared intelligence about the Boston bombers with the FBI. But according to several news reports, American authorities did not take this intelligence seriously because they were presented a sanitised version of information on the bombers as the Russians did not want to reveal their sources and how they had obtained the intelligence.3 But the fact that Moscow did share such intelligence is testimony to its willingness to cooperate with Washington on fighting terrorism. Russia and the US announced at the G-8 meeting held in June in Fermanagh, Northern Ireland that they will intensify their cooperation, with information exchange and combined counter-terrorism operations.

Afghanistan

This intensified cooperation becomes crucial in the light of the US drawdown in Afghanistan. Moscow supported American efforts to oust the Taliban, following the September 11 attacks, by not opposing the grant of bases by the Central Asian Republics to the US. Even today, the US and Russia have similar concerns in Afghanistan. After Islamabad denied supply routes to Afghanistan following NATO attacks on military check posts in Pakistan, Russia allowed the US to use the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) to transport important supplies to and from Afghanistan. Though some experts feel that the volume transiting through the NDN is not very much, the fact that Russia is allowing the use of NDN is significant. Further, Russia has allowed NATO to start a transit hub in Ulyanovsk, Russia to support the drawdown from Afghanistan. In the post 2014 scenario, Russia's support to the modalities of ISAF drawdown (particularly the use of the NDN) and the maintenance of any long term US presence in the country will be crucial.4 Washington and Moscow do not want Afghanistan to become a launching pad for extremists again after the US drawdown. In the post 2014 scenario, Washington will require Moscow's support for sustaining counter-terrorism, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities in the region.5

Central Asia

There are strong disagreements between the US and Russia on Central Asia. Russia has concerns about American influence and bases in Central Asia, which it considers to be part of its ""near abroad"" or sphere of influence. It is wary of American support to pro-democracy movements in the region, fearing it could result in the fall of regimes with which it has close ties and increase instability in the region. But given America's drawdown in Afghanistan, the shale gas revolution in the US, the US 'rebalance' to the Asia Pacific and, most importantly, the US economic decline, Washington's attention to this region is likely to reduce. Given that Obama has resisted the temptation to intervene in conflicts around the world, Washington may not want to or be able to sustain an intense involvement in the region -- thereby somewhat dissipating Russia's concerns.

Middle East

The Middle East, particularly since the Arab uprisings, has emerged as an area of contention between Moscow and Washington. Moscow abstained from voting on UNSC resolution 1973 which imposed a nofly zone on Libya. Moreover, it felt betrayed by the West which, according to Moscow, used the resolution to intervene in Libya. The West's action flew in the face of Russia's steadfast faith in the principle of nonintervention in other countries' internal affairs. Since then, Moscow has refused to support the West's polices towards the Arab Spring.

It is Syria which has emerged as the most vexed issue in US-Russia relations in recent times and the two countries have what President Obama describes as ""differing perspectives"" on the war though both agree on the need to end violence. Russia has criticised the US for its policy in Syria and has vetoed resolutions in the UNSC calling for sanctions against President Assad's regime. Moreover, it continues to support Assad and has announced that it will supply antiaircraft missiles and MIG fighters to Syria even as the EU has ended its arms embargo on Syria. Russia has its own problems with Islamic extremism and the growing radicalisation in the Northern Caucasus.6 Russia's concern is that Assad's fall may result in radical Islamist elements taking control in Syria. Moscow is also concerned about the fate of the Orthodox Christians in Syria. Moreover, Syria is an important arms importer for Russia and the latter's naval base in Tartu, so far, is the only base for the Russian Navy in the Mediterranean. But this is not a very big or a critical base for the Russians. They might even be willing to give it up if necessary.

Despite their differences with the US on Syria, the Russians have persevered and have been able to get the US on board for talks to be held at Geneva (the Geneva II talks) to resolve the imbroglio. Though at the moment, there seems little chance of the talks being held in the immediate future, it could possibly bring about a resolution to the Syrian crisis. The turmoil in Egypt is fuelling Russian skepticism about the 'Arab Spring'. Russia feels that the upheavals in the Middle East will only lead to instability and, probably, radical extremists gaining power.

Another issue of contention is Iran. Russia has relatively good ties with Iran though it has agreed to an arms embargo on the country and broke a contract to supply the S-300 long-range air defense missile system to Tehran. Iran and Russia, along with India, cooperated in supporting the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. After the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Moscow and Tehran might again have to cooperate to protect their interests.

Russia and the US are part of the P-5 plus 1. However, Russia and the US have serious differences over Iran's nuclear programme. Though Washington and Moscow broadly share concerns about Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, they differ on the tactics to be used against Tehran. In 2010, Russia supported UN sanctions against Iran but has refused to support further sanctions since 2011. It feels that being too harsh on Iran could have the reverse effect of making it more determined to acquire nuclear weapons or walk out of the NPT.7 Russia also has commercial interests in Iran. It helped Iran build the Bushehr nuclear plant despite US opposition. Russia wants Iran to participate in the Geneva-II talks on Syria as it feels it could contribute to resolving the crisis, a move that the West opposes.

The issue of human rights remains an impediment in Russia-US relations. US officials have time and again come down strongly on Russia for its alleged human rights abuses and growing authoritarianism. Russia, on its part, accuses the US of interfering in its internal affairs. The Russian argument is that US policy of exporting democracy is flawed and will lead to instability. Egypt is one example of this. Russia feels that each country will arrive at, through its own process, a political system that suits it best. Russia even accused the US of supporting, if not fostering, the protests against Putin in the last two years. Relations reached a new low after the US passed the Magnitsky Act, which denies visas to officials allegedly involved in the death of the Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, in prison and freezed their assets in the US. In retaliation, Russia passed the Dima Yakovlev Act banning Americans from adopting Russian children, on the grounds that adopted Russian children have faced mistreatment in the US. The US recently published a list of 18 officials banned from travelling to the US under the Magnitsky Act. But, in what is being seen as a concession to Russia, most of the Russians named are minor officials. Russia has also published a ""stoplist"" of 18 American citizens allegedly involved in human rights abuses at Guantanamo Bay and against Russian citizens. Moreover, Russia has put restrictions on the operations and funding of NGOs in the country and thrown USAID out of the country.

Domestic Politics

The domestic political atmosphere in both countries is not favourable for stronger relations. Domestic constituencies play an important role in American foreign policy. There is no strong pro-Russia lobby in the US. Russian-Americans are not a significant voting bloc. In fact, the anti-Russia lobby continues to be very strong, thereby tying the President's hands on any rapprochement. The Russian diaspora's influence is also limited. Given the poor state of economic relations, there are no large stakeholders in either country who are prepared to lobby for the relationship.

Moreover, in the US, both the liberals and the conservatives resist good ties with Russia for differing reasons; the liberals because of human rights concerns and the conservatives because they still see Russia as a foe (e.g. Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney's description of Russia as the US' ""number one geopolitical foe"" during the US elections last year). Above all, there are well-organised groups with links to the defence sector and the military-industrial complex which work against arms reduction or the development of cooperation in the military and political areas.8 In such a domestic scenario, no wonder that despite his best intentions, President Obama has been unable to push his reset policy ahead. The domestic situation in Russia is no less conducive for good ties with the US. President Putin suspects the US of trying to overthrow his regime. In fact, during his presidential campaign, Putin's supporters accused the US of financing protests against their leader. The theme of Anti-Americanism was used by Putin during his election to consolidate domestic support, particularly among his working class base. So, given the domestic imperatives in both countries, there is little political incentive to improve relations.

Economic Relations

Economic relations, key to fostering better relations in a globalised world, between Russia and the US remain minimal. Russia has a positive trade balance with the US. In 2012, bilateral trade in goods reached just over $40 billion, much below bilateral trade between the US and China, as well as with other emerging countries like India, and Brazil.9 While the US' main exports to Russia are machinery, vehicles, aircraft, meat and optic and medical instruments (just 0.6% of its total exports), Russia's main exports to the US are mineral fuel, iron and steel, precious stones, inorganic chemical and fertilizers.10 In 2010, US investments in Russia were about $9.9 billion, while Russian investments in the US were about $ 4.4 billion,11 which is again much below potential. Some of the major problems impeding trade include US concerns about weak Intellectual Property Rights enforcement in Russia, lack of transparency in Russia, inefficient government regulations and corruption.12 On the Russian side, a variety of sanctions, export controls and other trade barriers restrict its access to US technology and trade. However, with Russia's recent entry into the WTO and the repeal of the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik Amendment extending 'Permanent Normal Trade Relations' status to Russia, there is a real chance for trade to grow between the US and Russia. Some experts opine that US exports to Russia could reach $ 20 billion over the next five years.13 For Russia, this is an opportunity for it to modernise its economy and diversify its exports base.14 Some signs of a revival of economic relations are evident: ExxonMobil and Rosneft have agreed on a joint venture for exploring the Arctic and Black Sea and participation of Rosneft in joint projects with ExxonMobil in the US and Canada.15

Conclusion

The US and Russia have had an uneasy relationship ever since the end of the Cold War. While they have cooperated in some areas, the relationship continues to be driven, to some extent, by a refusal on both sides to let go off the legacies of the Cold War. While Russia believes that it has not been given the recognition due to a great power, much of the US establishment appears to see Russia as a rival. Thus, relations are characterised by distrust on both sides.

For Russia, its bilateral relationship with the US is crucial at the moment. However, this is being rapidly challenged by its relationship with China. The pro-China lobby in Russia has been growing in strength over the last few years. Moscow's closeness to Beijing is further propelled by fear of a G-2 between Washington and Beijing. While economic relations between Russia and China might seem like a win-win for both countries, Russia is aware that in the long term, it might turn into a resource adjunct for China. Therefore, for Russia to maintain viability as a power and to retain its territorial integrity, it will have to diversify its economy from natural resource exports which contribute to a substantial part of its revenue. But to move into manufacturing and modernise its economy, Russia needs finance and technology. While the finances might be available with China, the technologies required for this modernisation are available only with the West -- particularly the US. Moreover, the West can help Russia to commercialise some of the technologies that it has independently developed over the years.

On the other hand, for the US, its relations with Russia are currently not a top priority and its focus is on the Asia-Pacific. But it is important for the US that it overcomes its distrust of Russia and improves relations in the context of the emerging US-China rivalry; a Russia which is in the Chinese camp would substantially tilt the balance towards China. Russia has announced its own pivot to the Asia-Pacific. Washington needs to leverage the positive contribution Moscow can make to Asia-Pacific security and stability. A multilateral Asian security architecture to deal with the rise of a more assertive China would be substantially strengthened if Russia were to be a part of it. Also, Moscow and Washington need to strengthen their cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue to bring about some resolution. Russia with its UN Security Council veto can be a huge spoiler for the US and prevent it from achieving its objectives on international issues.

Though Moscow and Washington have differences over several issues, as outlined above, none of these are insurmountable and there are several areas where they can work together. For instance, cyberspace and counter-narcotics are areas where cooperation can be bolstered. The two countries could also cooperate in exploring the Arctic resources. Russia desperately needs technologies from the West to map, explore and extract its resources in the region.16 Russia also wants to explore its shale gas resources, for which also it needs Western technology.17 Another sphere where they can cooperate is in measures to improve their images in both countries. People to people ties between Russia and the US are at a low level. So, one way to improve bilateral relations might be to increase the number of educational, cultural and scientific exchanges.

Thus, the Russian-American relationship is at an interesting phase at this point and it could either improve or worsen depending on the political will in both countries. It will be interesting also to see how the Snowden affair is handled by both countries. If Snowden is in Russia in September, when Obama is scheduled to attend the G-20 summit and Obama decides not to have a bilateral summit with Putin in Moscow, it will cause damage to their relations. If Russia and the US establish a dialogue that is free and frank and leads to bolstering their cooperation while managing their differences, there could possibly be a paradigm shift in the relationship. The prominent Russian academician, Sergei Rogov, in a study for the Russian International Affairs Council expresses the hope that the ""transition from mutually assured destruction to mutually assured stability should lead to mutually assured security for Russia and the United States"".18 Moscow and Washington have just announced the launch of a regular dialogue in the ""two plus two"" format between foreign and defence ministers to tackle issues of strategic stability, international security and shared threats. The world will be watching because stability in the US-Russia relationship will have a positive effect on international affairs.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

You might well be surveying London-wide theatre listings but this is the singular programme at Dailes theatre in Riga, Latvia's capital where, alongside some American heavyweights, British talents are at the forefront this season.

Among them are writer-director Jeff James and designer Rosanna Vize with an eye-popping version of The Winter's Tale, commissioned by Dailes's artistic director, Viesturs KairiÅ¡s. It opens with Hermione pleasuring herself to VR porn, reimagines Bohemia as a deadly video game and turns theatre's most famous stage direction into the supporting character of a hot-headed panda.

Time's ""swift passage"" speech, fast-forwarding 16 years in the plot, is just about all that remains from the original text, although Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (""Let me not to the marriage of true minds"") is shrewdly added and complemented by a scene featuring Leonard Cohen's Treaty (""I wish there was a treaty / between your love and mine""). It ends with a full ensemble jig to BeyoncÃ©'s Texas Hold 'Em. Did I mention the nuptials are officiated by a banana avatar?

""What I am doing would be illegal in the UK,"" says James with a laugh, a couple of hours before the show's premiere on a sweltering May evening. Completely rewriting Shakespeare could well be met with frosty suspicion at home. Never mind setting half the play inside a video game filmed with characters wearing ""beautiful, insane, faux heads"" and shown on a huge screen which mostly obscures the stage actors who stomp around behind, their oversized red boots poking out underneath.

""These are quite obviously distancing effects,"" he deadpans. ""But I would say that even these effects in combination are not as distancing as performing The Winter's Tale in the original Shakespearean verse. I think that is the ultimate alienation effect. To take the story and structure of the play and find a kind of contemporary language and world for it, makes the play - I hope - much more immediate to an audience today."" It is an often daft yet clever and ultimately moving evening, which knowingly toys with the risible elements of the original play yet honours its delicate blend of hope and regret.

Vize has designed an office playground in pink and yellow to suit this play about injured innocence and a childish tyrant. The Silicon Valley company AppZapp is ruled by billionaire boss Leo (the Leontes role) who has built a Bohemia metaverse, where baby Rose will be spirited away. Everyone is in disguise in Shakespeare's Bohemia, James points out. ""I thought: where do people go today and appear to be someone they are not? The internet.""

The trial runs for Leo's game have led to the deaths of several players, ratcheting up his trepidation and helping to explain his suspicion that Hermione is having an affair - something directors often have to work hard to establish. James, who happened to be expecting a second child with his partner while writing the script, was interested less in Leontes's sexual jealousy than in the character's anxiety about having another child. ""I thought, is there a story here of birth trauma and postnatal depression, and a really complex shared experience that Hermione and Leontes had?"" It is this fear that ultimately leads Leo to accuse Hermione of infidelity. ""If you've got someone who is shaping the whole world through their technologies, and has staggering wealth, what could a man like that do if he had this mistaken idea?""

How did KairiÅ¡s react to James's suggestion that he totally rewrite the play? ""He said 'you can do whatever the fuck you like',"" laughs James, who got the gig after being recommended by Ivo van Hove, with whom he worked as an associate director on several productions. Directors may be given greater power outside the UK, James says, ""but therefore you have more responsibility, as Spider-Man tells us! So they will go with your idea, but it's on you whether it lives or dies.""

Vize, who is preparing for collaborations in Sweden next year with director Maria Aberg, says that we tend to simplify a contrast between how theatre is made in the UK and the rest of Europe. ""It seems to me that every theatre in every European city, even separately from the others in that city, have a different sort of style.""

Dailes has an ensemble of 40 actors on staff, boasts Latvia's biggest stage (""wider than the Lyttelton, basically the same as the Coliseum [in London]"" says James) and receives substantial state funding. ""They need big shows. They do not want a three-hander. Viesturs basically said the more of our actors you can use the better because we want them to be used and they want the work."" In the UK, by contrast, the conversation is more often about how few actors you could get away with using.

James recognised a chance to create something on a bigger scale than he had ever been offered in the UK, where he has worked at venues including the Royal Exchange in Manchester and Nottingham Playhouse. He and Vize say it has been an empowering experience. For Vize, that is ironically partly down to the language barrier. ""The actors speak English, and the heads of the workshops do, but the actual people building and painting and sewing, they don't really. And it forces you to properly know what it is that you want to make ... I need to hand something over that doesn't require language to express it. That pushed me to be more decisive. I think you then find yourself in a conceptually stronger place.""

When he invited Vize to design the set and costumes, James said: ""We have to go big or go home ... we can use this opportunity to make something as exciting as we can possibly imagine."" Brexit does not seem to have hindered the enterprise. The creative team includes their British contemporaries - dramaturg James Yeatman, composer Kieran Lucas, lighting designer Adam Silverman - as well as video artist Jakub Lech from Poland and Latvian choreographer ElÄ«na GediÅa. Kintija Rogers, who translated James's script into Latvian, often joined rehearsals to continue fine-tuning. Several performances will have English surtitles - KairiÅ¡s suggests that one day they will be standard for every show.

At Dailes, a show will first be programmed for a handful of performances and its reception determines how long it stays in the repertoire. (Its biggest current hit is Anka Herbut's Rotkho, which reflects on authenticity in the art world and is directed by Lukasz Twarkowski.) There is not the immediate pressure to sell a long run of performances and there is also no preview system like the UK's; the show opens after two dress rehearsals which are available to the public. Having a permanent acting ensemble and their own workshop allows the theatre to take more risks, James suggests, as they are not hiring freelance cast and creatives for each production.

What else is different here? A better range of desserts on offer to audiences, a longer interval - all the more time to eat them - and the procedure for taking a bow, they explain. Also, much to Vize's delight, there are rarely dirty fingerprints left on her set. A stage cleaner regularly steps in during rehearsals. ""It's like an amazing sort of perfectionist dream.""

James and Vize say the pay is far greater than they are used to at home as Dailes is so well supported by the government; the subsidy it receives could pretty much cover the whole acting ensemble's salaries, explains KairiÅ¡s. Both MÄrtiÅÅ¡ Meiers (who plays Leo) and Madara ViÄ¼Äuka (who plays Rose as a teenager) are new to the ensemble. ViÄ¼Äuka has balanced her heart-wrenching Shakespearean role with some British-style farce courtesy of Peter Pan Goes Wrong, one of two Mischief Theatre comedies produced at Dailes this season. She also appeared in The Night of the Shining Princess by Latvian playwright Rainis (""he's our Shakespeare"") and Leopoldstadt directed by Malkovich, who has himself performed at the Dailes and hailed the ensemble as terrifically talented.

Meiers says he has found his roles ""extraordinarily demanding"", physically and emotionally. The pair agree it has been a rollercoaster start but that the ensemble quickly felt like family. ViÄ¼Äuka says that, as an actor, ""you can fool a lot of people, even sometimes lie to yourself, but when you're in a company working with the same people for years they know you - and know when you are fooling yourself. They'll tell you."" There is also a Latvian tradition of newer actors being assigned ""godparents"", Meiers explains: ""Someone you can talk to who will have a different perspective - actors are doubtful creatures.""

Big houses with ensembles still dominate the country's theatre culture but nimble, smaller independent companies are emerging. Meiers says that getting a placement in a repertory theatre after training used to be vital for a stage actor, but that's not quite the case any more.

In the past, the sheer size of the Dailes theatre has daunted some. Meiers says it makes or breaks young directors: ""It requires some sort of extraordinary talent to fill this space."" James ""had a precise vision"" of the story he wanted to tell, he adds.

""We've never had anything like this on the Latvian stage,"" KairiÅ¡s says of the audacious production. When he took over at the venue in 2020, he decided to showcase rising creative talent from across Europe rather than host established international megastars such as Van Hove. He likens it to a football club signing players: they don't have the deep pockets of the Bundesliga's Bayern Munich but are more like Borussia Dortmund, fielding future legends. He is also developing work with another of Van Hove's British associate directors, Daniel Raggett.

Dailes's internationalism helps to distinguish it from Riga's other venues which include Latvia's National theatre and the Mikhail Chekhov Riga Russian theatre, where KairiÅ¡s recently directed Hamlet: Wartime Chronicle, drawing a parallel between the war in Ukraine and the relationship between ""brother nations"" Denmark and Norway. ""We must be a real European theatre,"" he says of Dailes. ""We must sell European ideas to society because of Russia propaganda ... we still must fight for Europe, somehow.""

John Malkovich is directing Tom Stoppard's Leopoldstadt, there are dramas by Dennis Kelly and Duncan Macmillan, Sarah Ruhl adapts Eurydice, and The Play That Goes Wrong is packed to the rafters. You might well be surveying London-wide theatre listings but this is the singular programme at Dailes theatre in Riga, Latvia's capital where, alongside some American heavyweights, British talents are at the forefront this season.

Among them are writer-director Jeff James and designer Rosanna Vize with an eye-popping version of The Winter's Tale, commissioned by Dailes's artistic director, Viesturs KairiÅ¡s. It opens with Hermione pleasuring herself to VR porn, reimagines Bohemia as a deadly video game and turns theatre's most famous stage direction into the supporting character of a hot-headed panda.

Time's ""swift passage"" speech, fast-forwarding 16 years in the plot, is just about all that remains from the original text, although Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (""Let me not to the marriage of true minds"") is shrewdly added and complemented by a scene featuring Leonard Cohen's Treaty (""I wish there was a treaty / between your love and mine""). It ends with a full ensemble jig to BeyoncÃ©'s Texas Hold 'Em. Did I mention the nuptials are officiated by a banana avatar?

""What I am doing would be illegal in the UK,"" says James with a laugh, a couple of hours before the show's premiere on a sweltering May evening. Completely rewriting Shakespeare could well be met with frosty suspicion at home. Never mind setting half the play inside a video game filmed with characters wearing ""beautiful, insane, faux heads"" and shown on a huge screen which mostly obscures the stage actors who stomp around behind, their oversized red boots poking out underneath.

""These are quite obviously distancing effects,"" he deadpans. ""But I would say that even these effects in combination are not as distancing as performing The Winter's Tale in the original Shakespearean verse. I think that is the ultimate alienation effect. To take the story and structure of the play and find a kind of contemporary language and world for it, makes the play - I hope - much more immediate to an audience today."" It is an often daft yet clever and ultimately moving evening, which knowingly toys with the risible elements of the original play yet honours its delicate blend of hope and regret.

Vize has designed an office playground in pink and yellow to suit this play about injured innocence and a childish tyrant. The Silicon Valley company AppZapp is ruled by billionaire boss Leo (the Leontes role) who has built a Bohemia metaverse, where baby Rose will be spirited away. Everyone is in disguise in Shakespeare's Bohemia, James points out. ""I thought: where do people go today and appear to be someone they are not? The internet.""

The trial runs for Leo's game have led to the deaths of several players, ratcheting up his trepidation and helping to explain his suspicion that Hermione is having an affair - something directors often have to work hard to establish. James, who happened to be expecting a second child with his partner while writing the script, was interested less in Leontes's sexual jealousy than in the character's anxiety about having another child. ""I thought, is there a story here of birth trauma and postnatal depression, and a really complex shared experience that Hermione and Leontes had?"" It is this fear that ultimately leads Leo to accuse Hermione of infidelity. ""If you've got someone who is shaping the whole world through their technologies, and has staggering wealth, what could a man like that do if he had this mistaken idea?""

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Slogan at the fair stand: Beyond Performance - 50 Years of Porsche Turbo

Turbo talk with Monegasque racing driver StÃ©phane Ortelli followed by an autograph session

25 - 28 April 2024 / Hall 1 Stand A74

A visit to Porsche at the Retro Classics in Stuttgart is always a journey through time. This year, the sports car manufacturer will be celebrating its anniversary 'Beyond Performance - 50 Years of Porsche Turbo' at the trade fair for classic car fans and sports car enthusiasts, presenting impressive exhibits from 25 to 28 April 2024.

Retro Classics brings throngs of classic-car and sports-car enthusiasts from all around the world to Stuttgart. For Porsche, the trade fair is not just a home game, but a fixture in its annual event calendar. From Thursday to Sunday, 25 to 28 April 2024, the sports car manufacturer will showcase an extraordinary selection of exhibits there.

""This year we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Turbo at the Retro Classics. No other model reflects the company's innovative drive as strikingly as the Turbo derivatives,"" said Achim Stejskal, Director of Porsche Heritage and Museum.

In 1974, the sports car manufacturer presented the first series 911 Turbo at the Paris Motor Show. A technology that migrated from motorsport to series production in characteristic Porsche fashion.

""We are delighted to be able to show visitors vehicles that were always ahead of their time.""

On Saturday, April 27th at 2 pm, Thomas Krickelberg, Project Manager in the 911/718 model line at Porsche and Frank Jung, Head of the Company Archive, will talk to the Monegasque racing driver and Le Mans winner StÃ©phane Ortelli about the Turbo. Afterwards, Ortelli, who won the 24-hour race for Porsche in the Porsche 911 GT1 in 1998 together with teammates Laurent AÃ¯ello and Allan McNish, will be available for autograph requests. In addition to the Turbo Talk, visitors to the fair stand can also take part in guided tours on the topic of 50 years of Turbo.

At Stand A74 in Hall 1, the company will be showing the first 911 Turbo -- the one which saw Porsche usher in a new era. The first of its kind, the model exhibited is also a one-off, namely the Porsche 911 Turbo 'No. 1', which Louise PiÃ«ch received for her 70th birthday in the summer of 1974. In contrast to the Turbo models offered by the manufacturer from the spring of 1975 on, PiÃ«ch's gift has the narrow body of the 911 Carrera. The bonnet of the 176 kW (240 PS) sports car bears the ""Carrera"" logo instead of the 'Turbo' logo. In order to see the picturesque mountain landscapes of Austria in true-to-life colours, the daughter of Ferdinand Porsche refrained from tinting the windscreen. A badge on the glove compartment bears the initials LP and the inscription: Turbo-Porsche No. 1, Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, 29 Aug. 1974.

The next gem at the stand is a 911 Turbo 3.0 CoupÃ© from 1975. This Porsche in Silver Green Diamond was one of the first 30 Turbos to be completed within series production. The mirrors matched those of the Carrera and were painted in the exterior colour, while the wider wings were welded to the body by hand.

Another crowd-puller at the over 500-square-metre stand is a 911 GT2 with wing extensions and additional air intakes. In order to provide the Turbo engine with sufficient air, the adjustable rear wing had lateral openings. The equipment in the sports car from 1996 was spartan, ensuring that not a single extraneous gram was on board. The doors and bonnet were made of aluminium, rear and side windows were made of thin glass, and the manufacturer dispensed entirely with insulating material. The biturbo engine had 20 PS more power than the standard version.

Also on show at the fair is the 911 GT1 '98, a lightweight racer that tips the scales at just 970 kilograms. Unlike its predecessor with a sheet steel front end, the mid-engine sports car featured a carbon-fibre monocoque and a plastic outer shell. The water-cooled 3.2-litre, six-cylinder engine with two turbochargers generated around 404 kW (550 PS). Thanks to groundbreaking engine electronics, fuel consumption was very low, a decisive advantage when racing at Le Mans. This model served as a test vehicle throughout its entire career, and later as a stand-in for photo shoots.

The 911 Turbo S was one of only 435 models built by Porsche Exclusive. With 331 kW (450 PS), the air-cooled biturbo boxer engine was one of the most powerful of the 911 generation 993. The chassis of the sports car was lowered by 15 millimetres, and the body featured an aero package with front and rear spoilers. The four exhaust tailpipes were particularly striking. Visitors to the trade fair who take a look inside will see almost all plastic parts covered with leather.

There's a special story behind the latest Turbo model at the stand. The 911 Turbo S 'Duet' from 2020 is the product of a cooperation between Porsche and the aircraft manufacturer Embraer. Those who opted for the Phenom 300E business jet at the time could purchase a customised 911 Turbo S in a silver two-tone finish. In many of its details, the 650 PS sports car is reminiscent of aviation. For example, the side air intakes and trims on the side windows in brilliant chrome evoke the appearance of jet engines. The individual registration of the associated jet can be found on the underside of the rear wing as well as on the vehicle key of the model, which was produced in a limited run of ten units. In a nod to the wording on aircraft wings, the panels of the door sills in the doors bear the words 'No step'.

In addition to exciting vehicles from the Turbo era, Porsche will also be presenting two engine exhibits. While one engine from 1988 represents the second generation of the Turbo, the other comes from the seventh generation. Between the two models of the 911 Turbo - the first was called 930 in-house, the second 991 - was a span of 26 years and 220 PS. In a display case at the stand, Porsche will be showing a number of exhibits from the archive, such as the drawing of the Turbo logo from 1974, advertisements, and the equipment card of the first Turbo. The museum shop, which is integrated into the trade fair stand, offers visitors selected products related to Porsche as well as a collection specially created for the Turbo anniversary.

Crowning glory of a proven concept

For the public, the story of the Porsche 911 Turbo began on 13 September 1973 at the International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt. On that fateful Thursday, a silver 911 stood atop a round presentation podium bedecked in red. Upholstered in blue-black artificial leather, the seat centre panel featured the 'Black Watch' tartan pattern in blue-green. The 911 RSR Turbo concept car resembled a 911 Carrera RS 3.0, but for the large lettering on the rear wings of the prototype, which added the critical indication that a new model was in the offing. The word 'Turbo' heralded the forthcoming top-of-the-line version of the 911.

Almost a whole year would go by before the first 911 Turbo changed hands as a unique gift. It was none other than Ferry Porsche who gave the sports car, on behalf of all Porsche employees, to his sister Louise PiÃ«ch on 29 August 1974 to mark her 70th birthday. It was a very special one-off. On the rear it says 'Carrera' instead of 'Turbo', which distinguishes this special sports car from the following production vehicles - but the sweeping rear wing indicates that this is a very special model indeed. It is powered by a turbocharged test version of a 2.7-litre engine. Silver on the outside, upholstered with brick-red cowhide leather on the inside, the seat centre panel in a red-blue 'McLaughlin' tartan pattern. The car was equipped with the same anniversary package that also featured in the special model marking '25 years of driving in its most beautiful form'. This narrow-body 911 Turbo 2.7 CoupÃ© without what would become the typical Turbo widening would remain a one-off. It would go down in the history of the brand as the 911 Turbo 'No. 1'.

Porsche unveiled the series production version with a 3.0-litre engine on 3 October 1974 at the Paris Motor Show. Painted in Viper Green Diamond, inside it featured black leather and tartan seat centre panels. Although the first Turbo prototype had been shown the year before - at the outset of the oil crisis - customers were by no means deterred. In the spring of 1975, the Turbo was launched globally as the flagship of the 911 series - and it sold better than expected.

One of the fastest of its time

In the advertisement for the market launch in 1974, Porsche described the 911 Turbo as the ""crowning glory of a proven concept"". Fast-forward half a century and the words still ring true. Just like the subtitle: ""This car combines performance with luxury in perfect harmony. Its superior technology and practical comfort leave nothing to be desired."" The 911 Turbo went down in history as the world's first series-production sports car with an exhaust-gas-controlled turbocharger. And one of the fastest cars of its time. What set it apart from its competitors was its unrestricted day-to-day usability in combination with its luxurious interior equipment. In the press release from September 1974, Porsche also emphasised the ""refined power"" and ""exclusive sportiness"" of the 191 kW (260 PS) sports car.

Initially only planned for a small production run, the model that was internally named 930 would become a Porsche stalwart over the coming five decades. To date, there have been eight generations of the 911 Turbo. Porsche has crowned the company's model range with the name 'Turbo' since 1974. And the 'Turbo' recipe for success has not changed in all that time: the constant technical evolution of a timeless classic.

The Turbo principle has marked the frontier of what is feasible at Porsche for half a century. Turbo is far more than just a model designation. A Turbo from Zuffenhausen combines experience and success, sportiness and day-to-day usability. Every Turbo carries within it all the victories that Porsche has celebrated on the race tracks of the world.

A Turbo from Zuffenhausen. The mere thought of it is enthralling for many. A captivating vision of the ultimate connection between the driver and the road. The very embodiment of a sports car. Turbo stands for an intense driving experience, for sportiness paired with day-to-day usability, for experience and success. A Turbo always represents the limit of what is feasible. As the Turbo dynamically connects one with the road, the driver feels connected with it in turn. Turbo means a history that goes back 50 years to its roots - with origins in motorsports more than 50 years. Turbo as a technology platform. A Turbo is a sports car with uncompromising capability.

Even without mentioning Porsche, the word 'turbo' is inextricably associated with the sports car manufacturer for many automotive enthusiasts. It symbolises many things, not just the crowning glory of the eight 911 generations. Turbo is an integral part of the name of all models: 924 Turbo, 944 Turbo, Cayenne Turbo, Panamera Turbo and Macan Turbo. 'Turbo' embodies the name of a technology, 'Turbo-look' styling, turbocharging as a means of forced induction and, in the case of the Taycan Turbo, even a standalone brand name. In fact, the use of the 'Turbo' moniker in the all-electric Taycan shows that these five letters are no longer tied to the use of a physical exhaust turbocharger. On the contrary: almost all Porsche models today have exhaust turbochargers. But only the pioneering technological models are allowed to adorn themselves with the name 'Turbo'.

It is a tradition at Porsche to crown an existing model range with a Turbo variant. And it's a tradition at Porsche to be visionary. In the midst of the energy crisis in the early 1970s, Porsche was planning for the future - and was well ahead of its time in terms of technological progress. To this day, the sports car manufacturer has retained the idea of first testing new technology, such as the use of an exhaust turbocharger, on the race tracks of the world before they enter series production. Motorsport has always been firmly anchored in the brand's DNA. Porsche tests its mettle against the competition on the track, where lap times are measured and where the driver and the machine face the challenges of a race head-on. Porsche then compresses the knowledge from motorsport to its essence and incorporates it into its next sports car.

The difference between a Turbo and a non-Turbo is not just something you can see - more than anything, it's something you feel. At its market launch, the 911 Turbo was one of the fastest production vehicles of its time and the world's first with an exhaust-gas-controlled turbocharger. In contrast to its competitors, it was fully suitable for everyday use and offered plenty of comfort. It combined performance and luxury. The Turbo always fulfilled Ferry Porsche's desire for high engine performance coupled with efficient use of power. Constant technical evolution has always been the most important secret of success for any Turbo model from Zuffenhausen. The one that brings it closer to the ideal of a sports car than any before it.

With the title 'Beyond performance - 50 years of Porsche Turbo', Porsche unlocks a cosmos full of inspiring stories of triumph and perseverance in the face of challenge. It's never just about the pure power of a Turbo, but much more about the 'feel of Turbo'. The feeling of being able to exceed expectations at any time, but not having to prove yourself to anyone. To the feeling of always going beyond the ordinary. The feeling of 'more'.

The name Turbo in the Porsche family

Half a century ago, Porsche introduced the Turbo model designation for the flagship 911 series. Since then, the 'Turbo' designation has become synonymous with the range-topping Porsche models, and is no longer solely linked to the 911. Since the 1990s, motorsport-inspired series production cars have been even more track-focused, while the Turbo continues to combine uncompromising sportiness and everyday usability. A Turbo unites driving dynamics with efficiency and tradition with innovation, and represents the technological pinnacle in all Porsche model lines.

Mix of experience and success: from the Turbo look to turbocharging

In addition to being the crowning glory of eight 911 generations and the embodiment of a technology, the term 'Turbo' also denotes the particular 'Turbo look' and turbocharging in general. Even before the 911 Carrera was offered with a 'Turbo look' in autumn 1983, Porsche engineers built a 911 Carrera Cabriolet 'Turbo look' in Silver Rose Metallic as a pre-production car for then-CEO Peter W. Schutz. The vehicle's specification included not only the wide body and spoiler of the 911 Turbo, but also its suspension and the four-piston fixed-calliper brakes. Between 1983 and 1993, Porsche created wide-body 'Turbo-look' versions of the G-Series and 964 generations. The following models were available in 'Turbo-look' versions: 911 Carrera 3.2 CoupÃ© (1983 to 1989), 911 Carrera 3.2 Targa and Cabriolet (1984 to 1989), 911 Carrera Speedster (1988 to 1989), 911 Carrera 2 Cabriolet (1992 to 1993), 911 Carrera 2 Speedster (1993) and the anniversary edition 911 Carrera 4 CoupÃ© '30 years of the 911' (1993).

In 1995, Porsche launched the first 911 GT2. This track-focused GT car was based on the 911 Turbo of the 993 generation and featured an air-cooled 3.6-litre twin-turbo flat-six. In the years that followed, Porsche would also use turbocharging in the 911 GT2 of the 997 generations. As part of the new generation of engines, twin turbocharging was introduced in the broader 911 Carrera range from 2015. From 2016, Porsche also used turbocharging in the four-cylinder boxer engines of the 718 model series. The result: greater power and torque combined with lower fuel consumption.

Turbo as a synonym for pioneering achievements in all model lines

'Turbo' has also long been an integral part of the name in other Porsche model lines. It first adorned the Porsche 924 Turbo in 1979, the Porsche 944 Turbo in 1985 and the first 944 Turbo S three years later. The Cayenne Turbo was launched in 2002, and the even more powerful Turbo S in 2005. Porsche launched the Panamera range in 2009, and the first Turbo appeared the same year. Four years later came the top Turbo S variant. Finally, Porsche released the Macan Turbo in 2014.

Five years ago, the 'Turbo' moniker appeared for the first time on the Taycan Turbo. The first models in the new series, the Taycan Turbo S and Taycan Turbo, were the spearhead of Porsche E-Performance. The all-electric sports car was thus poised to continue the story of the Turbo model name - albeit this time without an actual exhaust turbocharger - with the most powerful series production models that the sports car manufacturer had in its product portfolio at the time.

Typical Turbo

What do Porsche enthusiasts think of when they hear the word 'Turbo'? Extravagant rear wings and wheelarches, lightweight construction, air vents between doors and rear wheels, and particularly sporty equipment. They think of special editions, dynamic performance, dramatic power delivery and speed. In addition, a Turbo always combines a wealth of innovations: In the second generation of the 911Turbo, Porsche positioned a charge-air cooler below the rear spoiler. This was a world first in a production car, and again an innovation derived from motor racing. Porsche presented the 996-generation 911 Turbo with PCCB ceramic composite disc brakes. The 911 Turbo (997) was the first series-produced petrol engine to employ turbochargers with Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG). Another characteristic feature of the Turbo is that the sports car manufacturer puts together a new Sport Chrono package for each model. With each new Turbo, Porsche ventures ever closer to the limits of what is possible. Comfortable and suitable for everyday use - that's typical Turbo as well.

Winning streaks, record laps, moments of alarm, and three whiskys - everyone who has experienced Porsche turbo technology has their own very personal story. Here, renowned racing drivers and engineers tell us what 'Turbo' means to them.

Walter RÃ¶hrl

The two-time World Rally champion, development driver and brand ambassador on his own personal turbo journey.

Superior

I first drove the 911 Turbo 3.0 in 1978. The handling of the car presented a challenge, but I was impressed by its power - so in 1979, I bought a 911 Turbo 3.3. I associate Porsche turbo technology in motorsport with power, success - and good friendship. The year 1981 was intense. Driving a 935 with irrepressible rear-wheel-drive power in the wet at Silverstone was a real balancing act. At Le Mans, we completed the distance very well in a 944 prototype. Friends of mine at Porsche built me a 924 Carrera GTS for the German Rally Championship, in which we celebrated four overall victories. Four years later, we carried on in the 911 Turbo S Le Mans GT. 500 PS in a car weighing 1,000 kilograms and without any downforce to speak of - that was quite the adventure.

Today, the 992-generation 911 Turbo is the best car in the world for me. The Turbo is effortless; incredibly powerful and quiet over long distances. I often get fuel consumption of nine litres per 100 km with this Porsche. High performance and incredible comfort: the original idea for the Turbo is alive and well. More so than ever before if you ask me.

Peter Falk

Head of the testing department during the era of the first 911 Turbo, and later head of motorsport behind the success of the Group C 956/962, the TAG-Turbo 'made by Porsche', and the 959 Paris-Dakar.

Those 'Wow!' moments

The 911 Turbo was developed in an era that actually ought to have heralded the end of the 911. I think it helped that our incoming Chairman of the Executive Board, Dr Ernst Fuhrmann, had witnessed the success of the newly turbocharged 917 Spyder in America. Making the 911 Turbo drivable for skilled everyday drivers was an enjoyable challenge, although there were initially a few hairy moments for us, as the chassis was somewhat overwhelmed by the power and weight of the car. Our test cars were capable of almost 300 km/h.

The decision-making processes at that time would be inconceivable today. For example, in spring 1977 I was able to convince Dr Fuhrmann to use the brake system derived from the 917 racing car in the roadgoing 911 Turbo 3.3. Fuhrmann was initially not a fan of this idea, saying: ""Why brake at all? We want people to drive."" After three whiskys we finally got his approval. Our conversation took place at the launch of the 928, at a bar in the south of France.

Valentin SchÃ¤ffer

Head of racing engines from 1964 to 1991, he was instrumental in developing the turbo engines for motorsport and is known to this day as the'Turbo Wizard'. Here SchÃ¤ffer recalls the winning engine from the Group C 956/962.

From America to Le Mans

The decision to enter Le Mans in 1981 came very late. As a result, we needed an engine that was capable of winning - and fast. I proposed the 2.65-litre flat-six to our Executive Board member for development, Helmuth Bott - the engine I had made for a now-cancelled US project. For Le Mans I had to remodel the engine from a single turbo to a twin-turbo configuration, and from running on methanol to running on petrol. Bott was sceptical: ""Will you manage this in time?"" I replied: ""I have to."" We won Le Mans.

The rules for 1982 cut permitted fuel consumption levels drastically. We reduced the boost pressure from 1.2 to 1.0 bar, leaving ourselves with around 580 PS. It was still enough to take the first three positions in the race. In 1983, to further reduce the fuel consumption we replaced the mechanical Kugelfischer injection with the Bosch Motronic 1.2 and achieved a very drivable 640 PS. In practice for Le Mans 1985, we used the entirely water-cooled 3.0-litre twin-turbo for the first time, which delivered 650 PS in racing trim. With this later descendent of the original US engine, we won in both 1986 and 1987. I was retired by the time the engine took one more victory in 1994.

Beginning, highlights and history

I started as a works driver in 2002 and had my first Turbo experience in 2003. I entered the 24-hour race on the Nordschleife in a 996-generation 911 Turbo run by Manthey Racing. The engine had well over 600 PS and driving this car was really wild. We came third, and I'll never forget what it was like driving this 911 on the Nordschleife. The 919 Hybrid - and its high-tech combination of an electric motor plus a V4 turbo petrol engine - was our winning car at Le Mans in 2017, and we won two World Endurance Championships with it. In 2018, I drove the most extreme lap of my life on the Nordschleife with the Evo version of the 919 Hybrid, which delivered more than 1,000 PS. My time was 5:19.55 minutes, with an average speed of 233.8 km/h, and a top speed 369 km/h. These days, I sometimes take racing cars from the Porsche Museum out for a drive to experience at first hand how the turbo engine developed. In the brutal 917/30 Spyder or the 935/78 'Moby Dick', the turbo feels like a power switch. The Group C 962, meanwhile, is incredibly powerful, but more drivable. The beginning, my highlights, and delving into history - all this is what 'turbo' means to me.

Thank you, 911 Turbo!

In January 1990, I became head of Porsche Motorsport North America (PMNA). They were interesting times. The economy had stalled and, after legendary success, our 962 was retired from racing. There was no sign of a new Porsche racing prototype that could win, with Weissach focusing on the Indy and a Formula One engine. Bob Carlson, the Porsche press representative in America, and I came up with an idea: 1991 was going to be the year of the IMSA Supercar Championship for near-series sports cars, with a lot of interest from manufacturers. Our 964-generation 911 Turbo could have been tailor-made for this series, and this particular Turbo was not selling well at the time. So we entered the Supercar series. Weissach was on board, sending two 911 cars for PMNA to fine-tune for racing. We won the championship in 1991 with our very popular drivers Hans-Joachim 'Strietzel' Stuck and Hurley Haywood. Sales of the 911 Turbo picked up again and PMNA was back on the podium. Customer sport began to thrive and we started on a new, successful course: Gran Turismo Sport. Thank you, 911 Turbo!

Practically unbeatable

Down through the years, 'turbo' was a hot topic. During a comparative test, I was in the 1,000 PS 917/10 Spyder from 1972 and JÃ¼rgen Barth was driving a 936 Spyder from 1976 with just 540 PS, with the two cars weighing about the same. On command, we each floored the accelerator in third gear. The 936 was already 100 metres ahead when the power in my car suddenly made the rear wheels spin. In the early 1980s, the development of the Group C 962 suggested to me that state-of-the-art electronics were vastly improving the power delivery. Soon afterwards came our TAG-Turbo for Formula One. With a steady 720 PS from 1.5 litres of displacement, I found the responsiveness to be almost on a par with that of a naturally aspirated engine. However, the sequential turbocharger of the 959 for the 1986 Paris-Dakar Rally was the crowning glory. A small turbo was activated at lower engine speeds, with a second turbo added at higher speeds, enabling sensitive application over loose ground. These days, 'turbo' is practically unbeatable. Unless, that is, you're talking about nostalgia, engine sound and silky-smooth drivability for us old track warriors.

The Turbo shaped my life

I was in my mid-20s, a Formula One driver dreaming of a Porsche 911 Turbo. I got really lucky, bought a fantastic black car on the cheap, and every drive thereafter was an experience. There had never been anything like it on the road. But back then, in the mid-1970s, the 911 Turbo was a wild beast without any electronic modifications as yet. In particular when it was raining you had to watch out - the performance boost from the big single turbocharger is eye-opening even today. At any rate, I drove my Turbo to a number of Formula One races, and there were many covetous looks at my 300 PS beauty from my fellow drivers. I mostly associate the Group C Porsche 962 with turbo in motorsport, as this is the best racing car I ever drove. We had up to 700 PS powering the rear wheels, and in 1985 my team-mate Derek Bell and I won the World Endurance Championship, while Derek, Al Holbert and I won Le Mans in 1986 and 1987 with the Porsche works team. All in all, turbo pretty much shaped my life.

Like a game of chess

After we won Le Mans in 1977, Dr Porsche put a 911 Turbo at my disposal. During our first drive on a country road, my fellow racing driver Peter Gregg and I were so blown away that we couldn't stop laughing at the incredible power of this car. From the second half of the 1970s onwards, I drove Porsche racing cars with turbo engines. During this time we had to adapt our driving style to the turbo. Rule number one was to keep the charger in line with the engine speed. So, you would brake hard going into a bend while also accelerating - a crazy driving style, really. We also modified our racing tactics accordingly. It was almost like a game of chess. You looked far ahead and plotted a route for getting through the traffic without losing engine speed and then having to wait a long time for your horsepower to build up again. Some people mastered this, others never got the hang of it. The 'turbo moment of silence' is now relegated to history, with Porsche turbo engines delivering power just as spontaneously as only naturally aspirated engines could in the past.

While holding a stopwatch

Timo Bernhard, Brendon Hartley and I won the World Endurance Championship in 2015 with the 919 Hybrid - the combustion engine part of our car was a V4 turbo. So, my memories of the turbo couldn't be better. Ever since I drove a 911 Turbo on the road I've always had one in my garage. The heart of the Porsche sports car is in motorsport. It feels as though the 911 Turbo was also developed while holding a stopwatch. Sheer power, all-wheel drive, variable aerodynamics. The turbo is the point of the spear, and with this car Porsche keeps pushing the supposed limits of what can be done. Since the first 911 Turbo from 1974, Porsche has maintained the tradition of combining the highest levels of performance with excellent comfort in this car.

Turbo with a twist: for young people, for kids and for connoisseurs

Since Porsche presented the first 911 Turbo in 1974, the word Turbo has developed its own unique appeal. The Turbo logo can now be found emblazoned on the flagship models from Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, Leipzig and Bratislava, regardless of the powertrain type - all-electric, plug-in hybrid or petrol engine. When it's connected with Porsche, 'Turbo' is an exuberantly positive synonym for the joys of extraordinary performance, for pioneering innovation - and at times even for the sweeter things in life ...

Turbo for Talents: comprehensive education with extra power

'Turbo' stands for extra power in youth sports, too. The Porsche youth development programme, Turbo for Talents, is currently working with eight partner clubs: RB Leipzig, Stuttgarter Kickers, RB FuÃball Akademie, Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach, VfB Stuttgart, FC Erzgebirge Aue, Bietigheim Steelers and the Ludwigsburg Porsche Basketball Academy (PBA). In addition to the best possible athletic training, up-and-coming football, basketball and ice hockey talents receive full support off the field of play. Cultural and social differences are transcended by sport and the young people involved develop self-confidence and perseverance. The programme teaches values such as team spirit, fairness, respect and passion. Turbo for Talents also pursues the objective of further developing the environmental and social dimension of education. The curriculum therefore encompasses inclusion, sustainable nutrition, health and responsible use of resources. With its Turbo Award, Porsche annually honours the best sporting development and academic performance.

Tina Turbo: the joy of technology and innovation

The Porsche Museum in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen regularly hosts appealing events for children The very young Porsche fans go on exciting museum tours, in the holiday programmes with the support of the walking acts Tom Targa and Tina Turbo, and learn surprising facts about Porsche. While Tom Targa wants to build a sports car for a big race, development engineer Tina Turbo enlists the kids' help to pack her creative suitcase. There are search tasks to complete, puzzles to solve, fun experiments to try and plenty of things to learn. On both tours the participating children discover plenty about Porsche motorsport and technical innovations.

Turbee: the power of nature

Since 2017, 50 bee colonies have been working at the natural off-road grounds in Leipzig with turbo-like efficiency. From the pollen of acacia, lime and blackberries, around three million bees produce up to 1.5 tonnes of spring blossom honey, which gourmets can purchase under the name Turbienchen. Since the summer of 2020, Turbienchen honey has also been produced in a factory-owned orchard near Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, and is available in the Porsche Museum shop and other outlets.",timesofoman.com,news,Times of Oman,http,0.3411764705882352,454234014,21,https://shabiba.eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/2024/05/1716537647-1716537647-bfdrwbbv3jgt.jpg,

The Russian Empire was seen as a strange place, an ""other."" The Soviet Union was so opaque that AmeriÂ­can intelligence agencies were reduced to analyzing who was standing next to whom in photos to determine proximity to power. The Russian Federation has been no exception, as many Western leaders were blindÂ­sided by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its full-scale invaÂ­sion of Ukraine in February 2022.

While the West's prior confusion may have resulted from literally not being able to penetrate Russia's icy winters, today's confusion comes from another place: a fundamental misunderstanding of Russia's governing system and of the two most significant Russian rulers during the last fifty years, Mikhail Gorbachev and Vladimir Putin. Two recent books, Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union, by Vladislav M. Zubok, and Putin, by Philip Short, illuminate what the West missed about both men. Both works, deeply researched and complex tomes, tell different parts of the same story, and together provide a clearer understanding of recent Russian history. Unfortunately, their insights arrived too late.

Gorbachev, who died in 2022, was seen in the West as the man who brought freedom and democracy and the end of the Cold War. But in reality, he was a diehard communist who only pursued the course he did because he believed that, in the end, communism would prevail. The failure of his beliefs and the collapse of the Soviet empire destroyed the very concept of ideological leadership in Russia -- until Vladimir Putin came along.

Since coming to power on the last day of the second millennium, Putin has been misunderstood by Western officials. Some have held that he is interested only in wealth, using nationalist language as a fig leaf to distract his people while he enjoys his palaces. Others have portrayed him as a twenty-first-century Hitler who desires to conquer all that he can. Both views are wrong. Putin is no more and no less than a deeply believing nationalist who sees himself as a modern czar. His goals are specific, not infinite, but will be pursued relentlessly.

The West has failed to understand these men, and the reality of internal Russian politics, in part because many scholars have tried to paint with too broad, and too ideological, a brush. Some ""realists,"" like John Mearsheimer, have argued that Russia, by defending its periphery, is simply acting as any state would. Liberal internationalists like former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul have concluded that Putin is simply in it for authoritarian glory and wealth.

But a close inspection of the workings of the Russian Federation reveals that its foreign policy emanates from two distinct internal govÂ­ernmental groupings. These comprise Russia's top levels of governing officials and its unofficial governors, the oligarchs. To understand why the Russian Federation has acted as it has, special attention must be paid to these two -- sometimes allied, sometimes opposed -- groups.

The first of these is the ""Russian nationalists."" ""Nationalism"" is a broad term which colloquially can mean anything from deep love of country to a desire for ethnic purity to a longing for expansionary conquest. Thus, the phrase ""I am a nationalist"" can conjure up images of Margaret Thatcher as well as Adolf Hitler.

In relation to Russia, nationalism becomes even trickier to define. The Russian language has two words for being Russian: rossisski (ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ÑÐºÐ¸) and russkiy (ÑÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹). Both are translated into English as ""Russian"" but mean very different things. The former indicates that one is a citizen of the Russian state, while the latter refers to the Russian ethnic group. The difficulty of this dichotomy has played out for centuÂ­ries, as Russian leaders have attempted to maintain control over what they considered the ""Russian world"" (Russkiy mir), which is loosely comprised of the Slavic states around Russia, namely Ukraine and Belarus.

Therefore, one can be a Russian nationalist in the sense of believing that the Russian state must be strong, have control over its near abroad, and should put its interests first. But one can also be a Russian nationalist in the sense of believing that Russia exists for the Russian ethnicity. There have always been and still are plenty of the latter in Russia, but ethnic-focused nationalists have not generally held real power in the Russian Federation. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis, ""RusÂ­sian nationalism"" as a phrase will refer to the former view: that Russia should be the defender of the Russkiy mir.

The second powerful grouping in Russian government, the ""oliÂ­garchs"" and other less wealthy but influential governing officials -- representing what I will call ""Russian subsistentialism"" -- is a new concept. In the early 1990s, the Russian Federation had effectively no raison d'Ãªtre. It was too weak to control the Russkiy mir; communism was dead; many Russians found themselves without a motivating philosophy as well as without bread and other necessities.

The Russian state, at this time, came to be run by people with no real governing ideology: democrats cheated and oligarchs robbed the country blind. Presidential staffers down to local police officers solicited bribes. By the mid-1990s, the goal for Russian leadership was no longer the promotion of an ideological principle or protection of a historic area; life became, for leaders and average citizens alike, centered around extracting resources from the state. Russian subsistentialism, therefore, can be imagined as the attitude of a bureaucrat or ordinary person who seeks only to subsist off the state. In general, this means taking what one can, but without pushing too hard or rocking the boat too much, which could undermine the whole lucrative system.

For much of its existence since 1991, the Russian Federation government has been composed almost entirely of subsistentialists, with very few nationalists. In general, ideological commitments among the Russian leadership class had been decimated by Gorbachev's failures. Nevertheless, a few nationalists, from the beginning, sought to carry out their central ambition: to ensure that Russia reclaimed hegemony over the Russkiy mir. But the subsistentialist leaders just wanted to be left alone: they enjoyed their dachas and their bribes and being wooed at international galas. Crucially, however, there were certain red lines that even subsistentialists, who still needed to oversee a viable Russian state, could not allow the West to cross.

When one nationalist, Vladimir Putin, managed to get into the presidency of the Russian Federation -- somewhat by accident -- he was still unable to carry out his vision. In part, this was because Russia was weak. But more importantly, Putin was unable to convince the subsistentialists to jeopardize their cushy lives for the sake of pursuing nationalist objectives. Due to actions taken by the West, however, Putin and his relatively small bloc of nationalists have managed, over time, to convince the subsistentialists to join their side.

It is unfortunate that Western observers have failed to understand the internal politics of the Russian Federation. Westerners have typically seen Russian ideological divides solely through the lens of liberalism versus authoritarianism. Or they saw a state that was simply too weak to act. While material weakness played a large role in Russia's acquiescence to Western foreign policy decisions in the 1990s and early 2000s, it was also a matter of will, with the nationalists unable to convince the subsistentialists of their cause. Had the West recognized the divide within the Russian government, however, different choices might have been made, and perhaps the current, dismal state of Russo-Western relations could have been avoided. Instead, Putin was able to bridge the internal Russian divide before the West realized it even existed.

Mikhail Gorbachev is remembered in the West as a democratizing liberator: the only Soviet leader who understood that his country needed freedom and change. When he passed away in 2022, eulogies poured in from Western leaders around the world, praising his diplomacy with Ronald Reagan and his reforms to the Soviet economy. But in Russia, Gorbachev is reviled as the man who destroyed the country's economy and ended its time as a great power.

Western liberal internationalists misunderstand the Russian revulsion toward Gorbachev for two reasons. First, they misunderstand the man himself. Gorbachev was not a liberal anti-communist. He was a true Leninist who believed that communism would one day engulf the entire planet. He differed from his predecessors only in his choice of tactics, believing that communism would spread peacefully.

This feeds into the second reason underlying Western confusion: namely, the West generally misunderstands the cause of Soviet collapse. The traditional view is that the Cold War was won by containing and ultimately outspending the Soviet Union. But Russia views the end differently. Zubok expounds upon this subject at length in Collapse. His central thesis is that the factors that brought down the Soviet Union were a ""perfect storm, unleashed by the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev."" While Zubok does not completely deny the role of the West, he ultimately argues that collapse was mainly a result of Gorbachev's own actions.

When he came to power in 1985, Gorbachev inherited a bevy of problems, some of which had concerned Russian leaders for centuries, others which were relatively new. To begin with, Gorbachev was not a ""Russian"" leader. While the West frequently (and, frankly, understandably) used ""Soviet Union"" and ""Russia"" interchangeably, the two were fundamentally different.

Multiethnic empires maintain authority over disparate ethnicities through unifying national myths or through force. This is a problem Russian states have wrestled with for centuries. The Russian Empire's approach was relatively straightforward: the czar is chosen by God to defend the Russian people and the empire which they have conquered -- in short, the Russkiy mir. The czarist state also saw itself as the protecÂ­tor of the Slavs; while they did not demand control of all Slavic lands, Russia did react harshly when non-Slavs attempted to conquer Slavic lands.

But while the Soviet Union's borders were similar to the Russian Empire's, its raison d'Ãªtre was fundamentally different. The Bolsheviks had turned the machinery of state to a new goal: rather than protecting the Russkiy mir and focusing on hegemony over nearby areas, the state would be an engine for communist domination of the world.

They also restructured how the entity the rest of the world called ""Russia"" was organized. USSR stood for Union of Soviet Socialist ReÂ­publics, and that was not merely symbolic nomenclature: the system was a union of fifteen republics, overseen by the Soviet government in Moscow. Russia, in the form of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was only one of those fifteen. While it was by far the largest, ethnic Russians in 1989 made up just slightly over half of the population of the Soviet Union, 145 million out of 289 million.

When times were good in the Soviet Union -- or, when they had leaders willing to massacre millions to keep dissidence to a minimum -- this system worked fine. But Moscow had to keep the outlying poorer republics happy. This involved significant amounts of economic aid, which often came from the Russian republic, over time fueling a simmering feeling among Russians that they were being taken advantage of.

Externally, things were no less complex. Often in history, the Russian state has created what can be called a ""buffer zone of influence"" between itself and Europe proper, separate from the Russkiy mir. This zone encompassed eastern and sometimes central Europe, and it differed from a traditional ""buffer zone"" in that Russia did not just see it as a gigantic moat. It also saw in this area the chance for economic domination and, perhaps most importantly, a way to protect the Russkiy mir.

But under the USSR during the post-World War II period, this meant that the mode of ""influence"" in the buffer zone was communism. If an Eastern Bloc government ever felt like going a different way, it could threaten the entire chain. This is why the Soviet Union reacted so harshly in 1956, when Hungary attempted to overthrow the system, and in 1968, when Czechoslovakia attempted to create a slightly more relaxed communist system.

When Gorbachev came onto the scene, cracks were already beginning to show in the Soviet order. The previous two leaders, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, were both aged; each barely lasted a year in office. Economic issues were beginning to cause production problems and food scarcity. ""We can't go on living like this,"" Gorbachev said to his wife at the funeral of his predecessor, Chernenko. At the time, ""Russian nationalism"" could not be straightforwardly articulated by the leader of the USSR, as it was fundamentally different from communist ideology. But if one defines nationalism as pride in one's country, Gorbachev was a true nationalist: a deeply proud and committed Soviet.

Gorbachev was determined to fix, not end, the Soviet system. He believed that with devolution -- giving some of his power to the repubÂ­lics and allowing for free elections -- and by going forward with glasnost (openness) and perestroika (rebuilding), there would be a burst of disÂ­cussion and creativity centered around how to fix communism.

There was indeed a burst of discussion. But it was centered around how terrible the system was. Newspapers began to criticize the regime. He also allowed the creation of films like Zerograd (in which a Soviet bureaucrat becomes lost in an increasingly strange and eerie city), which would have gotten their creators shot just decades prior.

By the late 1980s, Gorbachev's devolution of powers had allowed opponents to rise. The most popular was Boris Yeltsin, who had dramatically left the Communist Party and became the head of the Russian Republic in 1990. While Gorbachev was still in charge of the USSR, Yeltsin, as leader of its largest republic, was immediately vaulted into international fame.

Zubok records that Yeltsin, on a trip to the United States, was driving back to the Dallas airport and passed a Randall's discount supermarket. On a whim, he stopped in and was amazed at the variety of products. More than anything else, though, he was angry; average Americans could eat foods that middle-class Russians could never acquire.

When Gorbachev loosened travel rules, millions of Soviet citizens had similar experiences, and each experience slowly ate away at whatÂ­ever pride in communism may have remained. But Gorbachev, blinded by his belief that communism would win in the end, was unable to see the growing disaster. He continued to privatize, but along the way continually ran into problems. His privatization was making people poorer via inflation and a lack of food, and therefore angrier; and his allowance of more political freedom let people channel their anger into votes for those opposed to him.

To the rest of the world, Gorbachev seemed like a hero. By 1990, he had ended the Cold War, tore down the Berlin Wall, and ended Soviet interference in the postwar buffer zone of influence. But the West misunderstood why he did these things. The Soviets unilaterally agreed to end the Cold War mainly because they could not keep up with American spending. When the Berlin Wall fell, it was an accident: a confused East German official on TV misspoke and said travel to the West would be allowed. And when Gorbachev declared that the Soviet Union would not interfere in the internal affairs of Communist Bloc states, he did so not out of a desire to end communism there, but because he viewed the Eastern European states as a liability for his reforms. The Eastern Bloc took large amounts of money from the USSR in subsidies. Gorbachev, an idealogue, believed that communism would one day triumph. So who cared if, temporarily, those states went their own way? Gorbachev got a verbal agreement from the West that they would not expand NATO into these newly freed areas. He -- out of naÃ¯vetÃ© or out of necessity -- accepted, because he was badly in need of Western financial aid.

Needless to say, nationalists and the security services were not thrilled with these reforms. In August 1991, some attempted a halfhearted Stalinist coup. But it failed: the coup plotters were noncommittal and hundreds of thousands of Muscovites came out to protest. Most famousÂ­ly, Yeltsin climbed atop a tank and, with news cameras rolling, urged soldiers to stand down.

Others in the security services were simply paralyzed. In the late 1980s, KGB cells in East Germany had been pleading with Moscow for help and for guidance on how to react to the political changes. Should they infiltrate the protests? Knock them back? Moscow was indecisive. At one point, a crowd threateningly came up to the local KGB building. A corporal desperately radioed Moscow for help, but there was no response. Alone, he went out to the protestors and had to bluff. That corporal, a completely unknown official by the name of Vladimir Putin, never forgot Moscow's moment of weakness.

Nor must he have forgotten how the West was reacting to the slow collapse of the Soviet empire. While then president George H. W. Bush and his people were very polite, they essentially did nothing to stop the collapse. Some in Bush's administration, notably Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, wished to see the Soviet Union thrown onto the ash heap of history. Others, like Bush and Secretary of State James Baker, were concerned that a collapse could lead to widespread violence and preferred a weaker yet still cohesive USSR. Gorbachev was reduced to pleading, both for restraint on the side of the West and for money. But the West was hesitant. Gorbachev, as a proud Soviet, was refusing to free the Baltic states and opposed Ukrainian independence. While Bush was not especially hawkish on these issues, dreading post-Soviet chaos, sending billions to Gorbachev would have been politically difficult when an election was coming up in 1992. Instead, the West demanded full privatization from Gorbachev before serious money could go to the Soviets. This was impossible; sudden privatization would mean prices would rise to their real levels (instead of the artificially low Soviet levels), which would increase scarcity. The West, on the cusp of finally defeating the enemy, failed to see the long-term potential for catastrophe.

When the Soviet Union finally disappeared on Christmas Day 1991, it did so with a whimper. The republics, Boris Yeltsin's Russia among them, simply left. In his six years in power, Gorbachev had sought to save the Soviet Union by involving its people more in decision-making and removing power from the dreaded Communist Party bureaucrats. But in taking these steps, he drained support for the ideology he so loved and allowed political enemies to rise. By the end of his reign, communism was no longer the ideology of the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union did not exist. Russia had lost the control of its buffer zone of influence and, for the moment, had lost control of the Russkiy mir.

The newly independent Russian Federation, under Boris Yeltsin, started in a brutal spot. They still had all the economic troubles of the Soviet Union, but the state was essentially powerless. Yeltsin engaged in ""shock therapy,"" which was designed to rapidly convert the system to private enterprise, but it quickly resulted in even more material scarcity. This, in turn, sparked a near instantaneous realization among many of the Russian elite in the early to mid-1990s: Russia's time as a major world power was finished. The new Russian Federation was a husk of what past Russian state structures had been. Its resources, however, were still plentiful. As a result, instead of dedicating themselves to fixing the state, many officials simply robbed it of its parts, becoming filthy rich. Those who stayed in government and did not manage to steal a large slice of the pie still made a living off bribery. This spread through society; it soon became impossible to get basic things done without a bribe. The overwhelming majority of upper-level Russian governing officials thus adopted subsistentialist attitudes.

While there were still some Russians in government who believed in democracy, their ranks were quickly thinning. Even Yeltsin, who had first appeared as a democratic reformer, cheated to win his reelection in 1996, managing to achieve victory with only a 10 percent approval rating. After ""winning"" reelection, Yeltsin told a group of supporters that Russia had no motivating ideology and that it should consider getting a new one -- but he soon lost interest in doing so.

By the end of the decade, the country was practically falling apart. Externally, things were no better. While the West had verbally promised Gorbachev that NATO would not expand into Russia's former buffer zone of influence, the alliance quickly moved into the region: by 2000, Czechia, Hungary, and Poland would all come under America's nuclear umbrella. By 2004, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Baltics would do the same. Yugoslavia had fallen to pieces, resulting in war and genocide. While Russia attempted to interfere, it was at the time too weak, able to only sit and watch.

Gorbachev's commitment to communist ideology had destroyed everything previous Russian leaders had built for hundreds of years, and by the end of the 1990s, the aftereffects of his failure had destroyed Russians' belief in themselves. Yeltsin was failing too. A bloated alcoÂ­holic, he had suffered from multiple heart attacks and did not feel he would survive through the end of his term in 2002. Thus, he shocked Russia on New Year's Eve, 1999, by announcing his resignation from the presidency. His young prime minister would take the reins.

Vladimir Putin's ascent presented the world with a mystery. He remains an enigma nearly a quarter-century after coming to power, and Westerners are still debating exactly what he believes.

For a long time, Western leaders seemed to view Putin as just another subsistentialist; a pragmatic, corrupt official who enjoyed living in luxury and could be dealt with accordingly. They met him at meetings, shook hands, and signed off on oil pipeline deals. Even as late as 2012, former U.S. officials were claiming that Putin's use of nationalist rhetoric was just for show. When he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they were shocked.

Some Westerners viewed him in a sharply different light. These individuals argue that Putin, or as they often call him online, ""Putler"" -- a portmanteau of Putin and Hitler -- wants to conquer everything. To these individuals, Putin is not a rational actor but a genocidal madman. In America, this is a bipartisan view. In a press conference, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy directly compared Putin's actions to Hitler's in the 1930s. And when President Joe Biden exclaimed, ""By God, this man cannot be allowed to remain in power"" at a speech in Poland, he was not just affirming a desire for regime change; he was indicating that, for many, Putin is a unique evil who must be removed. The only thing stopping ""Putler,"" in their eyes, from attempting to conquer all of Europe is fear of America's nuclear arsenal. Therefore, America must constantly be watchful and should do all in its power to see him removed from the Kremlin.

Other commentators, instead of arguing that Putin has no ideology, have attempted to create one called ""Putinism."" Sometimes the meaning is vague: in an article published at the beginning of 2023 titled ""Is This the End of Putinism?,"" McFaul names but never defines this personal ideology. Anne Applebaum, another liberal internationalist, offered a more detailed exposition of Putinism: to her, Putin's ideology is an attempt at popular legitimacy so that he can cover up his stolen wealth and bring back the USSR.

That last accusation -- that Putin, the KGB agent, desperately wishes for a return of the lost communist empire -- is echoed by others such as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and former world chess champion turned Russian opposition politician Garry Kasparov. But this is unlikely, as Putin has regularly made clear his disdain for the Bolsheviks. In the early 1990s, Putin lamented the fact that the Bolsheviks had ended the Russian Empire. Later, he remarked, ""Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart, whoever wants it back has no brain."" He has gone further in his various speeches since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, repeatedly attacking Bolshevism for hacking up the Russian Empire into what he views as fake, artificial states. Those who wish to see Putin as a harbinger of a new USSR will likely respond with his famous 2005 speech in which he called the fall of the USSR a ""geopolitical disaster"" of the twentieth century. But these commentators often neglect to mention the sentences which followed: ""As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and comÂ­patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself."" His most blistering attack on the communists came in ""On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,"" an essay which argued that Ukraine was a fictional country created by Vladimir Lenin. No, Putin and the other nationalists do not wish to restore the USSR -- they simply wish to undo the effects of its collapse.

Applebaum has also argued that Putin does ""not seriously fear Western military attacks,"" a striking sentence considering it goes against the entire history of Putin's public-facing statements and, indeed, the entire history of the Russian Empire, the USSR, and the Russian Federation's foreign policy. His real fear, she argues, is his people finding out how much money he has stolen.

This is not to pick on Applebaum; many of Putin's liberal critics would say he is merely interested in procuring palaces and keeping his people weakened and unable to overthrow him. Putin does indeed like palaces, and the ones he has procured have often been built with money stolen from the state. But this does not mean that he has no ideology or does not care about his country.

So, what does Putin believe? In one of the most recent additions to the canon, Putin author Philip Short addresses that question at length. Short contends that Putin is a Russian nationalist today, but that he was not always one. Short argues that Putin, angry at what he saw as his country's mistreatment at the hands of Western powers in the early 1990s, then developed some nationalistic views, which he later modified or temporarily abandoned, only to return to them as president.

Short's work is a tour de force, and a tremendous addition to the literature on Russia's reclusive leader. But the notion that Putin ever abandoned his nationalism flies in the face of his own words and deeds. Consider what he said to consular ministers at an off-the-record meeting in 1993. At the time, he was working in the St. Petersburg mayor's office; one of his duties was interacting with foreign representatives. At one meeting, known today only because a French consul general sent a record to Paris, Short records that Putin unloaded on his foreign guests, complaining that Russia had lost Crimea, Kazakhstan, and the Baltic states, and that Russia had been humiliated since 1991. But perhaps most tellingly, he ended his rant by pointing out that ""[Yeltin's] foreign policy did not conform to Russia's true interests."" In 1995, while still an unknown, he expressed anger at a British representative that NATO was already planning to expand into counÂ­tries they had previously sworn off.

Four years later, however, Putin would suddenly become very known to the West. In March 1999, Putin -- by then Yeltsin's prime minister -- took his first action to forestall what he had previously only critiqued in private conversations: the expansion of Western influence and what he perceived as a desire to enforce unipolar hegemony on the world.

Serbia at the time was, the West believed, preparing for a genocidal campaign in Kosovo. The West acted, with NATO bombing Serbian positions. The Serbs probably were about to commit genocide, but NATO had always presented itself as a defensive organization. Neither Russia nor anyone else had anything to fear if it expanded -- so went the argument -- since NATO existed only for defense. The problem was that Kosovo was not a member state; it was not even recognized as a country. NATO had essentially decided to switch from being a purely defensive organization to becoming a ""policeman of the world.""

The Russians, even the subsistentialists, were rattled. If NATO had decided it could bomb Serbia, something which was supposedly outside its purview, what stopped it from bombing Kaliningrad, Russia's enclave in Europe? But the nationalists, like Putin, were not rattled -- they were furious. Serbia had long been on the fringes of the Russkiy mir; after all, Austria-Hungary's invasion of the country had begun World War I. As prime minister, Putin ordered Russian troops to seize a key Serbian airport before NATO troops got there. Though Russia eventually negoÂ­tiated a withdrawal with NATO, Putin would bring up the bombing of Serbia for decades to come.

Intervening in a NATO bombing campaign against a separate country, lamenting the loss of Kazakhstan, ripping into the Bolsheviks: these are not the statements of a man who just wants to live in luxury, nor are they the statements of one who misses the Soviet Union.

For a description of how Putin sees himself, we therefore need not create new terminology like Putinism. With his entire history considered, a fitting description seems obvious: czar. This is not meant as an insult, nor is it intended as a term of praise. It is recognition that Putin sees himself at the top of the Russian state, that he is entitled to the rewards of his position, and that it is his job to promote Russia's interests. As an ardent nationalist, he includes in that list hegemony over the Russkiy mir and, if possible, the recreation of a buffer zone of influence between Russia and the West.

""But he does not care about the people,"" his liberal critics would state. And this is likely true at some level; many Russians still live in terrible squalor, and the billions Putin stole to build his palaces could surely have helped them. But the circle can easily be squared. Like most (successful) czars before him, Putin quickly saw that so long as his people had bread and stable living, they would tolerate him living with a czar's luxury; he also, aware of the subsistentialism which had taken hold in Russia in the 1990s, realized that he could use the power of the state to provide the people with those things. This was the so-called social contract that he offered his citizenry in the early 2000s: though it was never explicitly stated, it could essentially be described as Putin saying, ""I will make sure the mafia cannot run rampant in the streets, secure essential state functions, and will provide you with a basic standard of living and a job with the state, if need be. You will look the other way as I build my palaces and help my rich friends.""

So far, he has (mostly) held up his side of that bargain. The Russian state is very good at creating jobs which do not need to exist, and the economy is mostly plodding along. Russians can go watch movies, and unlike in the early 1990s, their grocery stores are full of the goods which so shocked Yeltsin in Dallas. As Putin has attempted to conquer territoÂ­ry in pursuit of nationalist ambitions, Western sanctions have made it harder for average Russians, but not that much harder. They can no longer watch Marvel movies in theaters, and French wine has been replaced with Belarussian wine. But Putin, who likely always planned on getting back Ukraine and knew that the West would respond harshly, spent much of the last decade ""sanction-proofing"" the Russian economy -- an effort which has for the most part paid off. The economy has not imploded after two years of war. Being unable to see Spider Man will not foment a second Russian revolution.

Critics of this theory may argue that, if Putin truly saw himself as a nationalistic czar, responsible for returning Russia to a state of greatness, then he would have simply pushed the subsistentialists out of his government immediately. Why the slow going? Why allow any protests at all?

It is likely because Putin knows his Russian history. The autocratic regime of the Romanovs engendered anger against their rule. As autoÂ­crats, they were responsible for everything that went wrong; even when Russia was briefly a constitutional monarchy, it was not as if Nicholas II could blame his relatively weak prime ministers for every problem. By playing things ""legally"" -- as in ensuring that his controlled parliament passes amendments allowing him to run instead of just ignoring the constitution -- he can present a veneer of legitimacy.

As for working so closely with the subsistentialists? History is replete with kings having courtiers with whom they did not always agree. Sometimes it is due to a shared history; sometimes it is because it would be more difficult to remove them than it would be to allow them to remain. As with past czars, Putin has not tolerated too much indeÂ­pendence or disrespect from those with whom he disagrees -- but for much of his rule he did not require them to be in lockstep.

The West did not make Putin who he is. He was always a nationalist, and as president he has always seen himself in the role of a czar. These are realities that the West cannot be blamed for. But it can be blamed for failing to understand these realities. This is not to say that the West should have agreed with his actions and desires. It is simply to say that, for its own good, the West should have recognized that those desires existed. But instead, by increasingly pushing Russia, the West created the conditions which allowed Putin to convert the subsistentialists into nationalists, or to make them irrelevant, in order to launch a war which threatens to destroy the entire post-Cold War international order.

In 2011, Russia was three years into what became known as ""tandemÂ­ocracy."" By 2008, Putin had brought the oligarchs to heel, shut down revolution in Chechnya, and established himself as the man in charge. But 2008 also saw him reach his term limit, and as a result he switched places with his prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, with whom he had worked in various positions since the early 1990s. Medvedev was significantly younger, and foreign leaders, including Barack Obama, felt that he was a liberal breath of fresh air. They were, however, always uncertain as to who was really in charge, though most suspected that Putin pulled the strings.

Both hunches were true. There is no evidence that Medvedev was faking his openness to new ideas or to forward thinking. Likewise, there is ample evidence that Putin was by and large pulling the strings. There was, however, one clear moment in which Medvedev displayed indeÂ­pendence. It would also be the last.

During the 2011 Libyan Civil War, NATO desired to enforce a no-fly zone against Muammar Gaddafi, which required a UN Security Council resolution, meaning Russian approval. Medvedev gave it by way of abstaining. Putin was mortified, saying publicly that the resoÂ­lution resembled ""medieval calls for crusades."" Medvedev, in a rare public rebuke, called Putin's comments ""unacceptable.""

But events in Libya soon spiraled out of control. The NATO airstrikes intensified, and Gaddafi was hunted down and brutally killed by rebels. Putin was said to have watched the gruesome video of his death on repeat. A year later, Medvedev's term expired -- and so too did the tandemocracy. Putin returned to the presidency seemingly convinced that the West should be given no second chances.

Earlier in Medvedev's term, a lawyer and member of the opposition named Sergei Magnitsky was beaten to death in a Russian prison. WestÂ­ern governments were horrified. In 2012, Congress passed legislation that allowed the U.S. government to sanction Russians involved in his death.

The passage of the act has been seen in the West as unambiguously good policy, an important moral stand. But Short argues otherwise: in Russia, it was a demonstration that, no matter how much Russians felt they were working with the West, their interlocutors would always demand more. They also felt that America, with its torture and Guantanamo Bay detainees, was being hypocritical.

There is something to be said for the former complaint. Medvedev had been as liberal as one could get in Putin's Russia, and had trusted the West on Libya. The West responded by killing Gaddafi (or at least establishing the conditions for his death) and sanctioning Medvedev's government.

This was followed by the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, in which protestors overthrew incumbent president Viktor Yanukovych when he decided to move toward Russia instead of the European Union. Putin was incensed, seeing America's hand at work. While Maidan was not stirred up by America (it was stirred up by Yanukovych's use of force against protestors), the U.S. did not help dispel conspiracy theories. After Yanukovych's overthrow, the then director of the CIA, John Brennan, flew to Kyiv for undeclared reasons. A phone call involvÂ­ing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine discussing who should be in the new Ukrainian government would also leak, bolstering theories that it was all an American plot.

During the chaos, Putin quickly called a meeting of his Security Council -- the top decisionmakers in the Russian government -- and revealed to those assembled that he planned to take Crimea. The peninÂ­sula had been given to Ukraine as a sign of goodwill by Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s; as Ukraine was in the USSR, it was akin to Michigan giving Wisconsin the upper peninsula.

After the USSR's collapse, however, Crimea had always been a sticking point, with Russian strategists concerned about losing the peninsula. When Ukraine became independent in 1991, a deal allowing Russia to use the peninsula, and its crucial port, was negotiated. But Russians were still worried. In the mid-1990s, Yeltsin had warned President Clinton that the Communists, if they won the 1996 election, would seek to recapture it; but he too had expressed concern over Crimea's loss. So when Yanukovych was deposed and Ukraine suddenly lurched toward the West, it should have surprised no one that Russia would act. But the West seems to have misunderstood or ignored Russian security concerns.

Short points out that Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu* had been hesitant to endorse the 2014 invasion at the Security Council meeting. It is not hard to guess why: Shoigu was a subsistentialist. His predecessor had tried to reform the Russian military but upset too many generals and bureaucrats who liked the easier, old ways, and was pushed aside. When Shoigu became defense minister in 2012, he was not thinkÂ­ing like a nationalist and did not envision the Russian armed forces undertaking offensive maneuvers. He saw an army which would keep Russia, and him, secure. As a result, he never made risky reforms. Since 1992, this subsistentialist process -- get into position, discover issues, cover up issues, get rich, keep position -- was repeated ad nauseum across the Russian Federation.

But if Shoigu was concerned at the Security Council meeting, it was without merit. In weeks, Russia had seized Crimea and supported rebels in the industry-heavy Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. The Russo-Ukrainian War had begun. The Kremlin likely believed that this would grind Ukraine's movement to the West (including its movement into NATO) to a halt. While the West responded with sanctions on Russia in 2014, temporarily harming the economy, they did not fully unleash economic devastation on the country. This was for a mix of reasons: Europe had made itself dependent on cheap Russian gas and did not want to change things. Some, including President Obama, likewise did not think it wise to refocus America's foreign policy on Russia when China loomed as a much more significant threat. Besides, Russia taking Crimea ""made sense"" from a realist, amoral perspective; would the West really go to war over it?

But Putin was not acting like a realist, focused only on a strategic naval port; he was acting like a nationalistic czar seeking to rebuild his fractured empire. The West failed to recognize this, but their moment of reckoning came quickly. In early 2019, the pro-Western Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko (Yanukovych's successor) seemed likely to lose reelection to populist comedian Volodymyr Zelenskyy. To help his flagging numbers, he rammed constitutional amendments through the parliament which put the goal of joining NATO into Ukraine's constiÂ­tution. Zelenskyy won the election but left the amendments in place, as it would have been political suicide to repeal them.

Putin waited. Zelenskyy was not the favorite of the most ardently pro-Western Ukrainians, and perhaps Putin thought there might be a chance for a deal. But by early 2021, it became clear that Zelenskyy was unwilling or unable to bend Ukraine's establishment to the degree which would have allowed him to come to an arrangement with Putin. At the same time, his government had announced charges against Viktor Medvechuk, the leader of the pro-Russia bloc in Ukraine's parliament and a friend of Putin's.

Putin likely did not wish to engage in a massive war which would result in his country being cut off from the world. But at this point, he likely felt -- from his nationalist perspective -- that he had no other choice. Again and again, Putin made clear that Ukraine leaving the Russkiy mir and entering the Western fold was simply not an option for him. From that perspective, until around 2021, no bombs needed to be dropped, because Ukraine was still somewhat ensconced in the Russkiy mir.

But during 2021 it was obvious that this would not be the case for long. In response, over the course of that year, Russia began to build up its troops along the border of Ukraine. Once more, much of the West -- including Ukraine's own government -- was in denial. Ukraine seemed unable to imagine that Putin was such a nationalist that he would make war on the entire country. The Europeans who had dealt with Putin for two decades and shaken hands with him in nice conference rooms could not imagine it either.

Some subsistentialist Russians at home seemed unable to believe it as well. But by 2021, there were significantly fewer subsistentialists than there had been at the beginning of the decade. The most notable convert from subsistentialism to nationalism, and the most prominent example of how the West made unnecessary enemies, was Medvedev. The once liberal-ish president, burned by his Libya experience and still clearly incensed over the Magnitsky Act, had over the years become an angry nationalist, insisting that Russia must be respected in the world.

On February 21, 2022, the subsistentialist-nationalist divide came to a head. On that day, Vladimir Putin convened a Security Council meetÂ­ing, which was broadcast live. The ostensible purpose of the meeting was to gather the views of the individual council members on whether to recognize the independence of the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics from Ukraine, which would mean Russia would then defend them, bringing full-scale war. Council members were to share their opinions on whether recognition should go forward or if diplomacy should be given more time.

The subsistentialists on the council -- chiefly Sergey Lavrov, Shoigu, and Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service -- all hedged their bets. Lavrov and Shoigu made noncommittal statements, with the former suggesting that diplomacy be given a chance. Naryshkin misspoke repeatedly and stuttered so badly through his statement that Putin angrily told him to sit down. The nationalists, such as Medvedev and Nikolai Patrushev, a close Putin ally, were belliÂ­cose, urging Putin to recognize independence. Lavrov and Shoigu, clearly reading the room, both spoke again near the end and changed their tune, declaring that actually they believed recognition was the only way forward.

The subsistentialist hold over the Russian Federation was thus broken in real-time. But the effects of their work, or lack thereof, over the past decades remained. And this was Putin's only major blind spot. As Putin prepared to give the order to invade Ukraine, he thought he had a ready army and therefore failed to consider just how much the system had incentivized the subsistentialists to cover up any problems. And Shoigu never thought he would have to use his unprepared army to fight a major conflict, not fully appreciating the nationalist impulse to restore Russian greatness.

This divide in subsistentialist-nationalist thinking, and the strange dichotomy of a mostly subsistentialist governing structure being led by a nationalist, finally came to a boil when Russia invaded. Though failing to take Kyiv, as of this writing, Russia is in possession of the so-called Crimea corridor, a strip of land connecting the Crimean Peninsula to Russia proper, Luhansk, Donetsk, and much of the south. Together, it constitutes about 20 percent of Ukraine's territory.

Before the conflict expanded in February 2022, some realists argued that Russia would not launch a full-scale attack on Ukraine because it fell outside of Russia's national interest. To keep Ukraine out of NATO, the argument went, Russia simply had to keep a simmering conflict going in the country's east. After the full-scale attack started, those same realists and desperate diplomats suggested off-ramps for Russia, ways to disincentivize further attacks on Ukraine and to bring an end to the conflict. But these suggestions ignore Putin's view of this conflict as a battle for the Russkiy mir against the West and miss the fact that the pendulum of Russian domestic politics has finally swung away from the subsistentialists and toward the nationalists. No offer to release sancÂ­tions can dissuade Putin; this is a man who once argued that, in the event of nuclear war, the Russian people would go to paradise as martyrs.

Liberal internationalists like McFaul believe the solution involves calling for the fall of Putin's government. This too is wrong. Democracy is not going to cause Russia to simply drop all pretensions to irredentism, nor will it remove the inherent nationalistic impulse to be the leader of the Russkiy mir. If Russia feels threatened by the loss of former imperial territories it traditionally views as ""theirs,"" or by NATO's advance, the ballot box will make little difference. Democracies are fiercely protective of their peripheries. The first ever American presidential doctrine, the Monroe Doctrine, demanded Europe stay away from the entirety of the Americas. If Western leaders assume the lack of democracy is to blame for Russia's actions and decide to simply wait for free elections (or to create them), they will be doing so in vain; even the subsistentialists had security risks they were not prepared to take. Furthermore, there is no telling what might happen should the entire system come crumbling down.

None of this is, of course, to suggest that Putin's regime is desirable, or that the United States should somehow coax Russia into an alliance. Putin himself is a despot who has killed opposition figures with impunity and stolen hordes of wealth from his people. His Russian nationalist ideology will accept any amount of death (so long as the amount of death does not threaten the power of Russian nationalism) to retake the Russkiy mir, an area in which millions who do not necessarily want to be a part of a greater Russia are living. But evil men rule in many places; acceptance that they rule does not mean that one condones their rule. It merely means accepting the reality of the situation.

The West viewed the end of the Soviet Union as its handiwork, proof that the arc of history bent away from dictatorship. In his refutation of this belief, Zubok presciently writes, ""History is not a sequence of inevitability."" There are occasional, seismic leaders -- democratic and dictatorial alike -- who seize their chance to reshape their homelands in their own ideological image.

Russia has had two such men in the last fifty years, both of which were fundamentally misunderstood by their global opponents. Mikhail Gorbachev, the ardent communist wrongly seen as a determined privatizer, sought to remake his country but instead unmade it -- and hundreds of years of Russian imperial successes -- in the process. The second, Vladimir Putin, a czar dressed in presidential clothing, is now seeking to reverse the failures of his predecessor, and of his predecessor's state, to once again reunite the Russkiy mir.",americanaffairsjournal.org,news,American Affairs Journal,,-0.192156862745098,453875606,15,https://americanaffairsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/putin-Victory_Day_Parade_2005-26-e1715370668276.jpg,eng-9585682

NÃ¼rnberg is a post-punk duo formed in Minsk, Belarus, in 2016, comprising Yury Luhautsou (vocals, bass, synthesizers) and Aleh Sautin (guitar). Their artistic vision is deeply rooted in the melancholic essence of post-Soviet urban landscapes, echoing the lineage of 1980s British post-punk/new wave/coldwave.

Kavakos returns to the Xinghai Concert Hall, embarking on a new challenge - performing the complete set of six Bach solo violin sonatas and partitas (commonly known as the ""Sonatas and Partitas""). In this work, Bach crafted virtually every chord and employed counterpoint techniques that are almost impossible to play, earning the ""Sonatas and Partitas"" the nickname ""Old Testament of Violin Works."" For any violinist, performing the complete ""Sonatas and Partitas"" is not only a test of technical and musical prowess but also a monumental challenge of physical and mental endurance.

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses - and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermine its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday It will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

The Russian Empire was seen as a strange place, an ""other."" The Soviet Union was so opaque that AmeriÂ­can intelligence agencies were reduced to analyzing who was standing next to whom in photos to determine proximity to power. The Russian Federation has been no exception, as many Western leaders were blindÂ­sided by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its full-scale invaÂ­sion of Ukraine in February 2022.

While the West's prior confusion may have resulted from literally not being able to penetrate Russia's icy winters, today's confusion comes from another place: a fundamental misunderstanding of Russia's governing system and of the two most significant Russian rulers during the last fifty years, Mikhail Gorbachev and Vladimir Putin. Two recent books, Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union, by Vladislav M. Zubok, and Putin, by Philip Short, illuminate what the West missed about both men. Both works, deeply researched and complex tomes, tell different parts of the same story, and together provide a clearer understanding of recent Russian history. Unfortunately, their insights arrived too late.

Gorbachev, who died in 2022, was seen in the West as the man who brought freedom and democracy and the end of the Cold War. But in reality, he was a diehard communist who only pursued the course he did because he believed that, in the end, communism would prevail. The failure of his beliefs and the collapse of the Soviet empire destroyed the very concept of ideological leadership in Russia -- until Vladimir Putin came along.

Since coming to power on the last day of the second millennium, Putin has been misunderstood by Western officials. Some have held that he is interested only in wealth, using nationalist language as a fig leaf to distract his people while he enjoys his palaces. Others have portrayed him as a twenty-first-century Hitler who desires to conquer all that he can. Both views are wrong. Putin is no more and no less than a deeply believing nationalist who sees himself as a modern czar. His goals are specific, not infinite, but will be pursued relentlessly.

The West has failed to understand these men, and the reality of internal Russian politics, in part because many scholars have tried to paint with too broad, and too ideological, a brush. Some ""realists,"" like John Mearsheimer, have argued that Russia, by defending its periphery, is simply acting as any state would. Liberal internationalists like former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul have concluded that Putin is simply in it for authoritarian glory and wealth.

But a close inspection of the workings of the Russian Federation reveals that its foreign policy emanates from two distinct internal govÂ­ernmental groupings. These comprise Russia's top levels of governing officials and its unofficial governors, the oligarchs. To understand why the Russian Federation has acted as it has, special attention must be paid to these two -- sometimes allied, sometimes opposed -- groups.

The first of these is the ""Russian nationalists."" ""Nationalism"" is a broad term which colloquially can mean anything from deep love of country to a desire for ethnic purity to a longing for expansionary conquest. Thus, the phrase ""I am a nationalist"" can conjure up images of Margaret Thatcher as well as Adolf Hitler.

In relation to Russia, nationalism becomes even trickier to define. The Russian language has two words for being Russian: rossisski (ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ÑÐºÐ¸) and russkiy (ÑÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹). Both are translated into English as ""Russian"" but mean very different things. The former indicates that one is a citizen of the Russian state, while the latter refers to the Russian ethnic group. The difficulty of this dichotomy has played out for centuÂ­ries, as Russian leaders have attempted to maintain control over what they considered the ""Russian world"" (Russkiy mir), which is loosely comprised of the Slavic states around Russia, namely Ukraine and Belarus.

Therefore, one can be a Russian nationalist in the sense of believing that the Russian state must be strong, have control over its near abroad, and should put its interests first. But one can also be a Russian nationalist in the sense of believing that Russia exists for the Russian ethnicity. There have always been and still are plenty of the latter in Russia, but ethnic-focused nationalists have not generally held real power in the Russian Federation. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis, ""RusÂ­sian nationalism"" as a phrase will refer to the former view: that Russia should be the defender of the Russkiy mir.

The second powerful grouping in Russian government, the ""oliÂ­garchs"" and other less wealthy but influential governing officials -- representing what I will call ""Russian subsistentialism"" -- is a new concept. In the early 1990s, the Russian Federation had effectively no raison d'Ãªtre. It was too weak to control the Russkiy mir; communism was dead; many Russians found themselves without a motivating philosophy as well as without bread and other necessities.

The Russian state, at this time, came to be run by people with no real governing ideology: democrats cheated and oligarchs robbed the country blind. Presidential staffers down to local police officers solicited bribes. By the mid-1990s, the goal for Russian leadership was no longer the promotion of an ideological principle or protection of a historic area; life became, for leaders and average citizens alike, centered around extracting resources from the state. Russian subsistentialism, therefore, can be imagined as the attitude of a bureaucrat or ordinary person who seeks only to subsist off the state. In general, this means taking what one can, but without pushing too hard or rocking the boat too much, which could undermine the whole lucrative system.

For much of its existence since 1991, the Russian Federation government has been composed almost entirely of subsistentialists, with very few nationalists. In general, ideological commitments among the Russian leadership class had been decimated by Gorbachev's failures. Nevertheless, a few nationalists, from the beginning, sought to carry out their central ambition: to ensure that Russia reclaimed hegemony over the Russkiy mir. But the subsistentialist leaders just wanted to be left alone: they enjoyed their dachas and their bribes and being wooed at international galas. Crucially, however, there were certain red lines that even subsistentialists, who still needed to oversee a viable Russian state, could not allow the West to cross.

When one nationalist, Vladimir Putin, managed to get into the presidency of the Russian Federation -- somewhat by accident -- he was still unable to carry out his vision. In part, this was because Russia was weak. But more importantly, Putin was unable to convince the subsistentialists to jeopardize their cushy lives for the sake of pursuing nationalist objectives. Due to actions taken by the West, however, Putin and his relatively small bloc of nationalists have managed, over time, to convince the subsistentialists to join their side.

It is unfortunate that Western observers have failed to understand the internal politics of the Russian Federation. Westerners have typically seen Russian ideological divides solely through the lens of liberalism versus authoritarianism. Or they saw a state that was simply too weak to act. While material weakness played a large role in Russia's acquiescence to Western foreign policy decisions in the 1990s and early 2000s, it was also a matter of will, with the nationalists unable to convince the subsistentialists of their cause. Had the West recognized the divide within the Russian government, however, different choices might have been made, and perhaps the current, dismal state of Russo-Western relations could have been avoided. Instead, Putin was able to bridge the internal Russian divide before the West realized it even existed.

Mikhail Gorbachev is remembered in the West as a democratizing liberator: the only Soviet leader who understood that his country needed freedom and change. When he passed away in 2022, eulogies poured in from Western leaders around the world, praising his diplomacy with Ronald Reagan and his reforms to the Soviet economy. But in Russia, Gorbachev is reviled as the man who destroyed the country's economy and ended its time as a great power.

Western liberal internationalists misunderstand the Russian revulsion toward Gorbachev for two reasons. First, they misunderstand the man himself. Gorbachev was not a liberal anti-communist. He was a true Leninist who believed that communism would one day engulf the entire planet. He differed from his predecessors only in his choice of tactics, believing that communism would spread peacefully.

This feeds into the second reason underlying Western confusion: namely, the West generally misunderstands the cause of Soviet collapse. The traditional view is that the Cold War was won by containing and ultimately outspending the Soviet Union. But Russia views the end differently. Zubok expounds upon this subject at length in Collapse. His central thesis is that the factors that brought down the Soviet Union were a ""perfect storm, unleashed by the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev."" While Zubok does not completely deny the role of the West, he ultimately argues that collapse was mainly a result of Gorbachev's own actions.

When he came to power in 1985, Gorbachev inherited a bevy of problems, some of which had concerned Russian leaders for centuries, others which were relatively new. To begin with, Gorbachev was not a ""Russian"" leader. While the West frequently (and, frankly, understandably) used ""Soviet Union"" and ""Russia"" interchangeably, the two were fundamentally different.

Multiethnic empires maintain authority over disparate ethnicities through unifying national myths or through force. This is a problem Russian states have wrestled with for centuries. The Russian Empire's approach was relatively straightforward: the czar is chosen by God to defend the Russian people and the empire which they have conquered -- in short, the Russkiy mir. The czarist state also saw itself as the protecÂ­tor of the Slavs; while they did not demand control of all Slavic lands, Russia did react harshly when non-Slavs attempted to conquer Slavic lands.

But while the Soviet Union's borders were similar to the Russian Empire's, its raison d'Ãªtre was fundamentally different. The Bolsheviks had turned the machinery of state to a new goal: rather than protecting the Russkiy mir and focusing on hegemony over nearby areas, the state would be an engine for communist domination of the world.

They also restructured how the entity the rest of the world called ""Russia"" was organized. USSR stood for Union of Soviet Socialist ReÂ­publics, and that was not merely symbolic nomenclature: the system was a union of fifteen republics, overseen by the Soviet government in Moscow. Russia, in the form of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was only one of those fifteen. While it was by far the largest, ethnic Russians in 1989 made up just slightly over half of the population of the Soviet Union, 145 million out of 289 million.

When times were good in the Soviet Union -- or, when they had leaders willing to massacre millions to keep dissidence to a minimum -- this system worked fine. But Moscow had to keep the outlying poorer republics happy. This involved significant amounts of economic aid, which often came from the Russian republic, over time fueling a simmering feeling among Russians that they were being taken advantage of.

Externally, things were no less complex. Often in history, the Russian state has created what can be called a ""buffer zone of influence"" between itself and Europe proper, separate from the Russkiy mir. This zone encompassed eastern and sometimes central Europe, and it differed from a traditional ""buffer zone"" in that Russia did not just see it as a gigantic moat. It also saw in this area the chance for economic domination and, perhaps most importantly, a way to protect the Russkiy mir.

But under the USSR during the post-World War II period, this meant that the mode of ""influence"" in the buffer zone was communism. If an Eastern Bloc government ever felt like going a different way, it could threaten the entire chain. This is why the Soviet Union reacted so harshly in 1956, when Hungary attempted to overthrow the system, and in 1968, when Czechoslovakia attempted to create a slightly more relaxed communist system.

When Gorbachev came onto the scene, cracks were already beginning to show in the Soviet order. The previous two leaders, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, were both aged; each barely lasted a year in office. Economic issues were beginning to cause production problems and food scarcity. ""We can't go on living like this,"" Gorbachev said to his wife at the funeral of his predecessor, Chernenko. At the time, ""Russian nationalism"" could not be straightforwardly articulated by the leader of the USSR, as it was fundamentally different from communist ideology. But if one defines nationalism as pride in one's country, Gorbachev was a true nationalist: a deeply proud and committed Soviet.

Gorbachev was determined to fix, not end, the Soviet system. He believed that with devolution -- giving some of his power to the repubÂ­lics and allowing for free elections -- and by going forward with glasnost (openness) and perestroika (rebuilding), there would be a burst of disÂ­cussion and creativity centered around how to fix communism.

There was indeed a burst of discussion. But it was centered around how terrible the system was. Newspapers began to criticize the regime. He also allowed the creation of films like Zerograd (in which a Soviet bureaucrat becomes lost in an increasingly strange and eerie city), which would have gotten their creators shot just decades prior.

By the late 1980s, Gorbachev's devolution of powers had allowed opponents to rise. The most popular was Boris Yeltsin, who had dramatically left the Communist Party and became the head of the Russian Republic in 1990. While Gorbachev was still in charge of the USSR, Yeltsin, as leader of its largest republic, was immediately vaulted into international fame.

Zubok records that Yeltsin, on a trip to the United States, was driving back to the Dallas airport and passed a Randall's discount supermarket. On a whim, he stopped in and was amazed at the variety of products. More than anything else, though, he was angry; average Americans could eat foods that middle-class Russians could never acquire.

When Gorbachev loosened travel rules, millions of Soviet citizens had similar experiences, and each experience slowly ate away at whatÂ­ever pride in communism may have remained. But Gorbachev, blinded by his belief that communism would win in the end, was unable to see the growing disaster. He continued to privatize, but along the way continually ran into problems. His privatization was making people poorer via inflation and a lack of food, and therefore angrier; and his allowance of more political freedom let people channel their anger into votes for those opposed to him.

To the rest of the world, Gorbachev seemed like a hero. By 1990, he had ended the Cold War, tore down the Berlin Wall, and ended Soviet interference in the postwar buffer zone of influence. But the West misunderstood why he did these things. The Soviets unilaterally agreed to end the Cold War mainly because they could not keep up with American spending. When the Berlin Wall fell, it was an accident: a confused East German official on TV misspoke and said travel to the West would be allowed. And when Gorbachev declared that the Soviet Union would not interfere in the internal affairs of Communist Bloc states, he did so not out of a desire to end communism there, but because he viewed the Eastern European states as a liability for his reforms. The Eastern Bloc took large amounts of money from the USSR in subsidies. Gorbachev, an idealogue, believed that communism would one day triumph. So who cared if, temporarily, those states went their own way? Gorbachev got a verbal agreement from the West that they would not expand NATO into these newly freed areas. He -- out of naÃ¯vetÃ© or out of necessity -- accepted, because he was badly in need of Western financial aid.

Needless to say, nationalists and the security services were not thrilled with these reforms. In August 1991, some attempted a halfhearted Stalinist coup. But it failed: the coup plotters were noncommittal and hundreds of thousands of Muscovites came out to protest. Most famousÂ­ly, Yeltsin climbed atop a tank and, with news cameras rolling, urged soldiers to stand down.

Others in the security services were simply paralyzed. In the late 1980s, KGB cells in East Germany had been pleading with Moscow for help and for guidance on how to react to the political changes. Should they infiltrate the protests? Knock them back? Moscow was indecisive. At one point, a crowd threateningly came up to the local KGB building. A corporal desperately radioed Moscow for help, but there was no response. Alone, he went out to the protestors and had to bluff. That corporal, a completely unknown official by the name of Vladimir Putin, never forgot Moscow's moment of weakness.

Nor must he have forgotten how the West was reacting to the slow collapse of the Soviet empire. While then president George H. W. Bush and his people were very polite, they essentially did nothing to stop the collapse. Some in Bush's administration, notably Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, wished to see the Soviet Union thrown onto the ash heap of history. Others, like Bush and Secretary of State James Baker, were concerned that a collapse could lead to widespread violence and preferred a weaker yet still cohesive USSR. Gorbachev was reduced to pleading, both for restraint on the side of the West and for money. But the West was hesitant. Gorbachev, as a proud Soviet, was refusing to free the Baltic states and opposed Ukrainian independence. While Bush was not especially hawkish on these issues, dreading post-Soviet chaos, sending billions to Gorbachev would have been politically difficult when an election was coming up in 1992. Instead, the West demanded full privatization from Gorbachev before serious money could go to the Soviets. This was impossible; sudden privatization would mean prices would rise to their real levels (instead of the artificially low Soviet levels), which would increase scarcity. The West, on the cusp of finally defeating the enemy, failed to see the long-term potential for catastrophe.

When the Soviet Union finally disappeared on Christmas Day 1991, it did so with a whimper. The republics, Boris Yeltsin's Russia among them, simply left. In his six years in power, Gorbachev had sought to save the Soviet Union by involving its people more in decision-making and removing power from the dreaded Communist Party bureaucrats. But in taking these steps, he drained support for the ideology he so loved and allowed political enemies to rise. By the end of his reign, communism was no longer the ideology of the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union did not exist. Russia had lost the control of its buffer zone of influence and, for the moment, had lost control of the Russkiy mir.

The newly independent Russian Federation, under Boris Yeltsin, started in a brutal spot. They still had all the economic troubles of the Soviet Union, but the state was essentially powerless. Yeltsin engaged in ""shock therapy,"" which was designed to rapidly convert the system to private enterprise, but it quickly resulted in even more material scarcity. This, in turn, sparked a near instantaneous realization among many of the Russian elite in the early to mid-1990s: Russia's time as a major world power was finished. The new Russian Federation was a husk of what past Russian state structures had been. Its resources, however, were still plentiful. As a result, instead of dedicating themselves to fixing the state, many officials simply robbed it of its parts, becoming filthy rich. Those who stayed in government and did not manage to steal a large slice of the pie still made a living off bribery. This spread through society; it soon became impossible to get basic things done without a bribe. The overwhelming majority of upper-level Russian governing officials thus adopted subsistentialist attitudes.

While there were still some Russians in government who believed in democracy, their ranks were quickly thinning. Even Yeltsin, who had first appeared as a democratic reformer, cheated to win his reelection in 1996, managing to achieve victory with only a 10 percent approval rating. After ""winning"" reelection, Yeltsin told a group of supporters that Russia had no motivating ideology and that it should consider getting a new one -- but he soon lost interest in doing so.

By the end of the decade, the country was practically falling apart. Externally, things were no better. While the West had verbally promised Gorbachev that NATO would not expand into Russia's former buffer zone of influence, the alliance quickly moved into the region: by 2000, Czechia, Hungary, and Poland would all come under America's nuclear umbrella. By 2004, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Baltics would do the same. Yugoslavia had fallen to pieces, resulting in war and genocide. While Russia attempted to interfere, it was at the time too weak, able to only sit and watch.

Gorbachev's commitment to communist ideology had destroyed everything previous Russian leaders had built for hundreds of years, and by the end of the 1990s, the aftereffects of his failure had destroyed Russians' belief in themselves. Yeltsin was failing too. A bloated alcoÂ­holic, he had suffered from multiple heart attacks and did not feel he would survive through the end of his term in 2002. Thus, he shocked Russia on New Year's Eve, 1999, by announcing his resignation from the presidency. His young prime minister would take the reins.

Vladimir Putin's ascent presented the world with a mystery. He remains an enigma nearly a quarter-century after coming to power, and Westerners are still debating exactly what he believes.

For a long time, Western leaders seemed to view Putin as just another subsistentialist; a pragmatic, corrupt official who enjoyed living in luxury and could be dealt with accordingly. They met him at meetings, shook hands, and signed off on oil pipeline deals. Even as late as 2012, former U.S. officials were claiming that Putin's use of nationalist rhetoric was just for show. When he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they were shocked.

Some Westerners viewed him in a sharply different light. These individuals argue that Putin, or as they often call him online, ""Putler"" -- a portmanteau of Putin and Hitler -- wants to conquer everything. To these individuals, Putin is not a rational actor but a genocidal madman. In America, this is a bipartisan view. In a press conference, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy directly compared Putin's actions to Hitler's in the 1930s. And when President Joe Biden exclaimed, ""By God, this man cannot be allowed to remain in power"" at a speech in Poland, he was not just affirming a desire for regime change; he was indicating that, for many, Putin is a unique evil who must be removed. The only thing stopping ""Putler,"" in their eyes, from attempting to conquer all of Europe is fear of America's nuclear arsenal. Therefore, America must constantly be watchful and should do all in its power to see him removed from the Kremlin.

Other commentators, instead of arguing that Putin has no ideology, have attempted to create one called ""Putinism."" Sometimes the meaning is vague: in an article published at the beginning of 2023 titled ""Is This the End of Putinism?,"" McFaul names but never defines this personal ideology. Anne Applebaum, another liberal internationalist, offered a more detailed exposition of Putinism: to her, Putin's ideology is an attempt at popular legitimacy so that he can cover up his stolen wealth and bring back the USSR.

That last accusation -- that Putin, the KGB agent, desperately wishes for a return of the lost communist empire -- is echoed by others such as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and former world chess champion turned Russian opposition politician Garry Kasparov. But this is unlikely, as Putin has regularly made clear his disdain for the Bolsheviks. In the early 1990s, Putin lamented the fact that the Bolsheviks had ended the Russian Empire. Later, he remarked, ""Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart, whoever wants it back has no brain."" He has gone further in his various speeches since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, repeatedly attacking Bolshevism for hacking up the Russian Empire into what he views as fake, artificial states. Those who wish to see Putin as a harbinger of a new USSR will likely respond with his famous 2005 speech in which he called the fall of the USSR a ""geopolitical disaster"" of the twentieth century. But these commentators often neglect to mention the sentences which followed: ""As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and comÂ­patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself."" His most blistering attack on the communists came in ""On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,"" an essay which argued that Ukraine was a fictional country created by Vladimir Lenin. No, Putin and the other nationalists do not wish to restore the USSR -- they simply wish to undo the effects of its collapse.

Applebaum has also argued that Putin does ""not seriously fear Western military attacks,"" a striking sentence considering it goes against the entire history of Putin's public-facing statements and, indeed, the entire history of the Russian Empire, the USSR, and the Russian Federation's foreign policy. His real fear, she argues, is his people finding out how much money he has stolen.

This is not to pick on Applebaum; many of Putin's liberal critics would say he is merely interested in procuring palaces and keeping his people weakened and unable to overthrow him. Putin does indeed like palaces, and the ones he has procured have often been built with money stolen from the state. But this does not mean that he has no ideology or does not care about his country.

So, what does Putin believe? In one of the most recent additions to the canon, Putin author Philip Short addresses that question at length. Short contends that Putin is a Russian nationalist today, but that he was not always one. Short argues that Putin, angry at what he saw as his country's mistreatment at the hands of Western powers in the early 1990s, then developed some nationalistic views, which he later modified or temporarily abandoned, only to return to them as president.

Short's work is a tour de force, and a tremendous addition to the literature on Russia's reclusive leader. But the notion that Putin ever abandoned his nationalism flies in the face of his own words and deeds. Consider what he said to consular ministers at an off-the-record meeting in 1993. At the time, he was working in the St. Petersburg mayor's office; one of his duties was interacting with foreign representatives. At one meeting, known today only because a French consul general sent a record to Paris, Short records that Putin unloaded on his foreign guests, complaining that Russia had lost Crimea, Kazakhstan, and the Baltic states, and that Russia had been humiliated since 1991. But perhaps most tellingly, he ended his rant by pointing out that ""[Yeltin's] foreign policy did not conform to Russia's true interests."" In 1995, while still an unknown, he expressed anger at a British representative that NATO was already planning to expand into counÂ­tries they had previously sworn off.

Four years later, however, Putin would suddenly become very known to the West. In March 1999, Putin -- by then Yeltsin's prime minister -- took his first action to forestall what he had previously only critiqued in private conversations: the expansion of Western influence and what he perceived as a desire to enforce unipolar hegemony on the world.

Serbia at the time was, the West believed, preparing for a genocidal campaign in Kosovo. The West acted, with NATO bombing Serbian positions. The Serbs probably were about to commit genocide, but NATO had always presented itself as a defensive organization. Neither Russia nor anyone else had anything to fear if it expanded -- so went the argument -- since NATO existed only for defense. The problem was that Kosovo was not a member state; it was not even recognized as a country. NATO had essentially decided to switch from being a purely defensive organization to becoming a ""policeman of the world.""

The Russians, even the subsistentialists, were rattled. If NATO had decided it could bomb Serbia, something which was supposedly outside its purview, what stopped it from bombing Kaliningrad, Russia's enclave in Europe? But the nationalists, like Putin, were not rattled -- they were furious. Serbia had long been on the fringes of the Russkiy mir; after all, Austria-Hungary's invasion of the country had begun World War I. As prime minister, Putin ordered Russian troops to seize a key Serbian airport before NATO troops got there. Though Russia eventually negoÂ­tiated a withdrawal with NATO, Putin would bring up the bombing of Serbia for decades to come.

Intervening in a NATO bombing campaign against a separate country, lamenting the loss of Kazakhstan, ripping into the Bolsheviks: these are not the statements of a man who just wants to live in luxury, nor are they the statements of one who misses the Soviet Union.

For a description of how Putin sees himself, we therefore need not create new terminology like Putinism. With his entire history considered, a fitting description seems obvious: czar. This is not meant as an insult, nor is it intended as a term of praise. It is recognition that Putin sees himself at the top of the Russian state, that he is entitled to the rewards of his position, and that it is his job to promote Russia's interests. As an ardent nationalist, he includes in that list hegemony over the Russkiy mir and, if possible, the recreation of a buffer zone of influence between Russia and the West.

""But he does not care about the people,"" his liberal critics would state. And this is likely true at some level; many Russians still live in terrible squalor, and the billions Putin stole to build his palaces could surely have helped them. But the circle can easily be squared. Like most (successful) czars before him, Putin quickly saw that so long as his people had bread and stable living, they would tolerate him living with a czar's luxury; he also, aware of the subsistentialism which had taken hold in Russia in the 1990s, realized that he could use the power of the state to provide the people with those things. This was the so-called social contract that he offered his citizenry in the early 2000s: though it was never explicitly stated, it could essentially be described as Putin saying, ""I will make sure the mafia cannot run rampant in the streets, secure essential state functions, and will provide you with a basic standard of living and a job with the state, if need be. You will look the other way as I build my palaces and help my rich friends.""

So far, he has (mostly) held up his side of that bargain. The Russian state is very good at creating jobs which do not need to exist, and the economy is mostly plodding along. Russians can go watch movies, and unlike in the early 1990s, their grocery stores are full of the goods which so shocked Yeltsin in Dallas. As Putin has attempted to conquer territoÂ­ry in pursuit of nationalist ambitions, Western sanctions have made it harder for average Russians, but not that much harder. They can no longer watch Marvel movies in theaters, and French wine has been replaced with Belarussian wine. But Putin, who likely always planned on getting back Ukraine and knew that the West would respond harshly, spent much of the last decade ""sanction-proofing"" the Russian economy -- an effort which has for the most part paid off. The economy has not imploded after two years of war. Being unable to see Spider Man will not foment a second Russian revolution.

Critics of this theory may argue that, if Putin truly saw himself as a nationalistic czar, responsible for returning Russia to a state of greatness, then he would have simply pushed the subsistentialists out of his government immediately. Why the slow going? Why allow any protests at all?

It is likely because Putin knows his Russian history. The autocratic regime of the Romanovs engendered anger against their rule. As autoÂ­crats, they were responsible for everything that went wrong; even when Russia was briefly a constitutional monarchy, it was not as if Nicholas II could blame his relatively weak prime ministers for every problem. By playing things ""legally"" -- as in ensuring that his controlled parliament passes amendments allowing him to run instead of just ignoring the constitution -- he can present a veneer of legitimacy.

As for working so closely with the subsistentialists? History is replete with kings having courtiers with whom they did not always agree. Sometimes it is due to a shared history; sometimes it is because it would be more difficult to remove them than it would be to allow them to remain. As with past czars, Putin has not tolerated too much indeÂ­pendence or disrespect from those with whom he disagrees -- but for much of his rule he did not require them to be in lockstep.

The West did not make Putin who he is. He was always a nationalist, and as president he has always seen himself in the role of a czar. These are realities that the West cannot be blamed for. But it can be blamed for failing to understand these realities. This is not to say that the West should have agreed with his actions and desires. It is simply to say that, for its own good, the West should have recognized that those desires existed. But instead, by increasingly pushing Russia, the West created the conditions which allowed Putin to convert the subsistentialists into nationalists, or to make them irrelevant, in order to launch a war which threatens to destroy the entire post-Cold War international order.

In 2011, Russia was three years into what became known as ""tandemÂ­ocracy."" By 2008, Putin had brought the oligarchs to heel, shut down revolution in Chechnya, and established himself as the man in charge. But 2008 also saw him reach his term limit, and as a result he switched places with his prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, with whom he had worked in various positions since the early 1990s. Medvedev was significantly younger, and foreign leaders, including Barack Obama, felt that he was a liberal breath of fresh air. They were, however, always uncertain as to who was really in charge, though most suspected that Putin pulled the strings.

Both hunches were true. There is no evidence that Medvedev was faking his openness to new ideas or to forward thinking. Likewise, there is ample evidence that Putin was by and large pulling the strings. There was, however, one clear moment in which Medvedev displayed indeÂ­pendence. It would also be the last.

During the 2011 Libyan Civil War, NATO desired to enforce a no-fly zone against Muammar Gaddafi, which required a UN Security Council resolution, meaning Russian approval. Medvedev gave it by way of abstaining. Putin was mortified, saying publicly that the resoÂ­lution resembled ""medieval calls for crusades."" Medvedev, in a rare public rebuke, called Putin's comments ""unacceptable.""

But events in Libya soon spiraled out of control. The NATO airstrikes intensified, and Gaddafi was hunted down and brutally killed by rebels. Putin was said to have watched the gruesome video of his death on repeat. A year later, Medvedev's term expired -- and so too did the tandemocracy. Putin returned to the presidency seemingly convinced that the West should be given no second chances.

Earlier in Medvedev's term, a lawyer and member of the opposition named Sergei Magnitsky was beaten to death in a Russian prison. WestÂ­ern governments were horrified. In 2012, Congress passed legislation that allowed the U.S. government to sanction Russians involved in his death.

The passage of the act has been seen in the West as unambiguously good policy, an important moral stand. But Short argues otherwise: in Russia, it was a demonstration that, no matter how much Russians felt they were working with the West, their interlocutors would always demand more. They also felt that America, with its torture and Guantanamo Bay detainees, was being hypocritical.

There is something to be said for the former complaint. Medvedev had been as liberal as one could get in Putin's Russia, and had trusted the West on Libya. The West responded by killing Gaddafi (or at least establishing the conditions for his death) and sanctioning Medvedev's government.

This was followed by the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, in which protestors overthrew incumbent president Viktor Yanukovych when he decided to move toward Russia instead of the European Union. Putin was incensed, seeing America's hand at work. While Maidan was not stirred up by America (it was stirred up by Yanukovych's use of force against protestors), the U.S. did not help dispel conspiracy theories. After Yanukovych's overthrow, the then director of the CIA, John Brennan, flew to Kyiv for undeclared reasons. A phone call involvÂ­ing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine discussing who should be in the new Ukrainian government would also leak, bolstering theories that it was all an American plot.

During the chaos, Putin quickly called a meeting of his Security Council -- the top decisionmakers in the Russian government -- and revealed to those assembled that he planned to take Crimea. The peninÂ­sula had been given to Ukraine as a sign of goodwill by Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s; as Ukraine was in the USSR, it was akin to Michigan giving Wisconsin the upper peninsula.

After the USSR's collapse, however, Crimea had always been a sticking point, with Russian strategists concerned about losing the peninsula. When Ukraine became independent in 1991, a deal allowing Russia to use the peninsula, and its crucial port, was negotiated. But Russians were still worried. In the mid-1990s, Yeltsin had warned President Clinton that the Communists, if they won the 1996 election, would seek to recapture it; but he too had expressed concern over Crimea's loss. So when Yanukovych was deposed and Ukraine suddenly lurched toward the West, it should have surprised no one that Russia would act. But the West seems to have misunderstood or ignored Russian security concerns.

Short points out that Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu* had been hesitant to endorse the 2014 invasion at the Security Council meeting. It is not hard to guess why: Shoigu was a subsistentialist. His predecessor had tried to reform the Russian military but upset too many generals and bureaucrats who liked the easier, old ways, and was pushed aside. When Shoigu became defense minister in 2012, he was not thinkÂ­ing like a nationalist and did not envision the Russian armed forces undertaking offensive maneuvers. He saw an army which would keep Russia, and him, secure. As a result, he never made risky reforms. Since 1992, this subsistentialist process -- get into position, discover issues, cover up issues, get rich, keep position -- was repeated ad nauseum across the Russian Federation.

But if Shoigu was concerned at the Security Council meeting, it was without merit. In weeks, Russia had seized Crimea and supported rebels in the industry-heavy Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. The Russo-Ukrainian War had begun. The Kremlin likely believed that this would grind Ukraine's movement to the West (including its movement into NATO) to a halt. While the West responded with sanctions on Russia in 2014, temporarily harming the economy, they did not fully unleash economic devastation on the country. This was for a mix of reasons: Europe had made itself dependent on cheap Russian gas and did not want to change things. Some, including President Obama, likewise did not think it wise to refocus America's foreign policy on Russia when China loomed as a much more significant threat. Besides, Russia taking Crimea ""made sense"" from a realist, amoral perspective; would the West really go to war over it?

But Putin was not acting like a realist, focused only on a strategic naval port; he was acting like a nationalistic czar seeking to rebuild his fractured empire. The West failed to recognize this, but their moment of reckoning came quickly. In early 2019, the pro-Western Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko (Yanukovych's successor) seemed likely to lose reelection to populist comedian Volodymyr Zelenskyy. To help his flagging numbers, he rammed constitutional amendments through the parliament which put the goal of joining NATO into Ukraine's constiÂ­tution. Zelenskyy won the election but left the amendments in place, as it would have been political suicide to repeal them.

Putin waited. Zelenskyy was not the favorite of the most ardently pro-Western Ukrainians, and perhaps Putin thought there might be a chance for a deal. But by early 2021, it became clear that Zelenskyy was unwilling or unable to bend Ukraine's establishment to the degree which would have allowed him to come to an arrangement with Putin. At the same time, his government had announced charges against Viktor Medvechuk, the leader of the pro-Russia bloc in Ukraine's parliament and a friend of Putin's.

Putin likely did not wish to engage in a massive war which would result in his country being cut off from the world. But at this point, he likely felt -- from his nationalist perspective -- that he had no other choice. Again and again, Putin made clear that Ukraine leaving the Russkiy mir and entering the Western fold was simply not an option for him. From that perspective, until around 2021, no bombs needed to be dropped, because Ukraine was still somewhat ensconced in the Russkiy mir.

But during 2021 it was obvious that this would not be the case for long. In response, over the course of that year, Russia began to build up its troops along the border of Ukraine. Once more, much of the West -- including Ukraine's own government -- was in denial. Ukraine seemed unable to imagine that Putin was such a nationalist that he would make war on the entire country. The Europeans who had dealt with Putin for two decades and shaken hands with him in nice conference rooms could not imagine it either.

Some subsistentialist Russians at home seemed unable to believe it as well. But by 2021, there were significantly fewer subsistentialists than there had been at the beginning of the decade. The most notable convert from subsistentialism to nationalism, and the most prominent example of how the West made unnecessary enemies, was Medvedev. The once liberal-ish president, burned by his Libya experience and still clearly incensed over the Magnitsky Act, had over the years become an angry nationalist, insisting that Russia must be respected in the world.

On February 21, 2022, the subsistentialist-nationalist divide came to a head. On that day, Vladimir Putin convened a Security Council meetÂ­ing, which was broadcast live. The ostensible purpose of the meeting was to gather the views of the individual council members on whether to recognize the independence of the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics from Ukraine, which would mean Russia would then defend them, bringing full-scale war. Council members were to share their opinions on whether recognition should go forward or if diplomacy should be given more time.

The subsistentialists on the council -- chiefly Sergey Lavrov, Shoigu, and Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service -- all hedged their bets. Lavrov and Shoigu made noncommittal statements, with the former suggesting that diplomacy be given a chance. Naryshkin misspoke repeatedly and stuttered so badly through his statement that Putin angrily told him to sit down. The nationalists, such as Medvedev and Nikolai Patrushev, a close Putin ally, were belliÂ­cose, urging Putin to recognize independence. Lavrov and Shoigu, clearly reading the room, both spoke again near the end and changed their tune, declaring that actually they believed recognition was the only way forward.

The subsistentialist hold over the Russian Federation was thus broken in real-time. But the effects of their work, or lack thereof, over the past decades remained. And this was Putin's only major blind spot. As Putin prepared to give the order to invade Ukraine, he thought he had a ready army and therefore failed to consider just how much the system had incentivized the subsistentialists to cover up any problems. And Shoigu never thought he would have to use his unprepared army to fight a major conflict, not fully appreciating the nationalist impulse to restore Russian greatness.

This divide in subsistentialist-nationalist thinking, and the strange dichotomy of a mostly subsistentialist governing structure being led by a nationalist, finally came to a boil when Russia invaded. Though failing to take Kyiv, as of this writing, Russia is in possession of the so-called Crimea corridor, a strip of land connecting the Crimean Peninsula to Russia proper, Luhansk, Donetsk, and much of the south. Together, it constitutes about 20 percent of Ukraine's territory.

Before the conflict expanded in February 2022, some realists argued that Russia would not launch a full-scale attack on Ukraine because it fell outside of Russia's national interest. To keep Ukraine out of NATO, the argument went, Russia simply had to keep a simmering conflict going in the country's east. After the full-scale attack started, those same realists and desperate diplomats suggested off-ramps for Russia, ways to disincentivize further attacks on Ukraine and to bring an end to the conflict. But these suggestions ignore Putin's view of this conflict as a battle for the Russkiy mir against the West and miss the fact that the pendulum of Russian domestic politics has finally swung away from the subsistentialists and toward the nationalists. No offer to release sancÂ­tions can dissuade Putin; this is a man who once argued that, in the event of nuclear war, the Russian people would go to paradise as martyrs.

Liberal internationalists like McFaul believe the solution involves calling for the fall of Putin's government. This too is wrong. Democracy is not going to cause Russia to simply drop all pretensions to irredentism, nor will it remove the inherent nationalistic impulse to be the leader of the Russkiy mir. If Russia feels threatened by the loss of former imperial territories it traditionally views as ""theirs,"" or by NATO's advance, the ballot box will make little difference. Democracies are fiercely protective of their peripheries. The first ever American presidential doctrine, the Monroe Doctrine, demanded Europe stay away from the entirety of the Americas. If Western leaders assume the lack of democracy is to blame for Russia's actions and decide to simply wait for free elections (or to create them), they will be doing so in vain; even the subsistentialists had security risks they were not prepared to take. Furthermore, there is no telling what might happen should the entire system come crumbling down.

None of this is, of course, to suggest that Putin's regime is desirable, or that the United States should somehow coax Russia into an alliance. Putin himself is a despot who has killed opposition figures with impunity and stolen hordes of wealth from his people. His Russian nationalist ideology will accept any amount of death (so long as the amount of death does not threaten the power of Russian nationalism) to retake the Russkiy mir, an area in which millions who do not necessarily want to be a part of a greater Russia are living. But evil men rule in many places; acceptance that they rule does not mean that one condones their rule. It merely means accepting the reality of the situation.

The West viewed the end of the Soviet Union as its handiwork, proof that the arc of history bent away from dictatorship. In his refutation of this belief, Zubok presciently writes, ""History is not a sequence of inevitability."" There are occasional, seismic leaders -- democratic and dictatorial alike -- who seize their chance to reshape their homelands in their own ideological image.

Russia has had two such men in the last fifty years, both of which were fundamentally misunderstood by their global opponents. Mikhail Gorbachev, the ardent communist wrongly seen as a determined privatizer, sought to remake his country but instead unmade it -- and hundreds of years of Russian imperial successes -- in the process. The second, Vladimir Putin, a czar dressed in presidential clothing, is now seeking to reverse the failures of his predecessor, and of his predecessor's state, to once again reunite the Russkiy mir.",americanaffairsjournal.org,news,American Affairs Journal,,-0.192156862745098,453875606,20,https://americanaffairsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/putin-Victory_Day_Parade_2005-26-e1715370668276.jpg,eng-9585682

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Our top story tonight, toronto's pro-palestinian demonstrators who have been camped out at the university of toronto for weeks are presenting a counter-offer to school administrators tonight, we're just hours away from a deadline. University officials have set for clearing the

encampment. Encampment spokesperson says the protesters work together on a list of demands and it hopes the university will quickly divest itself of investments in companies profiting from israel's offensive in gaza. The university issued a trespass notice to protesters on friday, which survey kate. The property by 8:00am monday. >> In the interest of transparency in correcting the record. We feel it's important to publicize are negotiating process. Offer. We're given by the administration on thursday. It's more for restatement of university policy that is an actual offer. Most of what was outlined in the document are processes that could have been initiated by students before the encampment before speaking to administration. The same processes that we know time again and then failure because president gertler has the authority to simply say no to the recommendation of a committee that he stacks himself. >> We, the students are steadfast in our demands for divestment, for disclosure and for cutting ties with israeli academic institutions complicit in israeli apartheid.

You might well be surveying London-wide theatre listings but this is the singular programme at Dailes theatre in Riga, Latvia's capital where, alongside some American heavyweights, British talents are at the forefront this season.

Among them are writer-director Jeff James and designer Rosanna Vize with an eye-popping version of The Winter's Tale, commissioned by Dailes's artistic director, Viesturs KairiÅ¡s. It opens with Hermione pleasuring herself to VR porn, reimagines Bohemia as a deadly video game and turns theatre's most famous stage direction into the supporting character of a hot-headed panda.

Time's ""swift passage"" speech, fast-forwarding 16 years in the plot, is just about all that remains from the original text, although Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (""Let me not to the marriage of true minds"") is shrewdly added and complemented by a scene featuring Leonard Cohen's Treaty (""I wish there was a treaty / between your love and mine""). It ends with a full ensemble jig to BeyoncÃ©'s Texas Hold 'Em. Did I mention the nuptials are officiated by a banana avatar?

""What I am doing would be illegal in the UK,"" says James with a laugh, a couple of hours before the show's premiere on a sweltering May evening. Completely rewriting Shakespeare could well be met with frosty suspicion at home. Never mind setting half the play inside a video game filmed with characters wearing ""beautiful, insane, faux heads"" and shown on a huge screen which mostly obscures the stage actors who stomp around behind, their oversized red boots poking out underneath.

""These are quite obviously distancing effects,"" he deadpans. ""But I would say that even these effects in combination are not as distancing as performing The Winter's Tale in the original Shakespearean verse. I think that is the ultimate alienation effect. To take the story and structure of the play and find a kind of contemporary language and world for it, makes the play - I hope - much more immediate to an audience today."" It is an often daft yet clever and ultimately moving evening, which knowingly toys with the risible elements of the original play yet honours its delicate blend of hope and regret.

Vize has designed an office playground in pink and yellow to suit this play about injured innocence and a childish tyrant. The Silicon Valley company AppZapp is ruled by billionaire boss Leo (the Leontes role) who has built a Bohemia metaverse, where baby Rose will be spirited away. Everyone is in disguise in Shakespeare's Bohemia, James points out. ""I thought: where do people go today and appear to be someone they are not? The internet.""

The trial runs for Leo's game have led to the deaths of several players, ratcheting up his trepidation and helping to explain his suspicion that Hermione is having an affair - something directors often have to work hard to establish. James, who happened to be expecting a second child with his partner while writing the script, was interested less in Leontes's sexual jealousy than in the character's anxiety about having another child. ""I thought, is there a story here of birth trauma and postnatal depression, and a really complex shared experience that Hermione and Leontes had?"" It is this fear that ultimately leads Leo to accuse Hermione of infidelity. ""If you've got someone who is shaping the whole world through their technologies, and has staggering wealth, what could a man like that do if he had this mistaken idea?""

How did KairiÅ¡s react to James's suggestion that he totally rewrite the play? ""He said 'you can do whatever the fuck you like',"" laughs James, who got the gig after being recommended by Ivo van Hove, with whom he worked as an associate director on several productions. Directors may be given greater power outside the UK, James says, ""but therefore you have more responsibility, as Spider-Man tells us! So they will go with your idea, but it's on you whether it lives or dies.""

Vize, who is preparing for collaborations in Sweden next year with director Maria Aberg, says that we tend to simplify a contrast between how theatre is made in the UK and the rest of Europe. ""It seems to me that every theatre in every European city, even separately from the others in that city, have a different sort of style.""

Dailes has an ensemble of 40 actors on staff, boasts Latvia's biggest stage (""wider than the Lyttelton, basically the same as the Coliseum [in London]"" says James) and receives substantial state funding. ""They need big shows. They do not want a three-hander. Viesturs basically said the more of our actors you can use the better because we want them to be used and they want the work."" In the UK, by contrast, the conversation is more often about how few actors you could get away with using.

James recognised a chance to create something on a bigger scale than he had ever been offered in the UK, where he has worked at venues including the Royal Exchange in Manchester and Nottingham Playhouse. He and Vize say it has been an empowering experience. For Vize, that is ironically partly down to the language barrier. ""The actors speak English, and the heads of the workshops do, but the actual people building and painting and sewing, they don't really. And it forces you to properly know what it is that you want to make ... I need to hand something over that doesn't require language to express it. That pushed me to be more decisive. I think you then find yourself in a conceptually stronger place.""

When he invited Vize to design the set and costumes, James said: ""We have to go big or go home ... we can use this opportunity to make something as exciting as we can possibly imagine."" Brexit does not seem to have hindered the enterprise. The creative team includes their British contemporaries - dramaturg James Yeatman, composer Kieran Lucas, lighting designer Adam Silverman - as well as video artist Jakub Lech from Poland and Latvian choreographer ElÄ«na GediÅa. Kintija Rogers, who translated James's script into Latvian, often joined rehearsals to continue fine-tuning. Several performances will have English surtitles - KairiÅ¡s suggests that one day they will be standard for every show.

At Dailes, a show will first be programmed for a handful of performances and its reception determines how long it stays in the repertoire. (Its biggest current hit is Anka Herbut's Rotkho, which reflects on authenticity in the art world and is directed by Lukasz Twarkowski.) There is not the immediate pressure to sell a long run of performances and there is also no preview system like the UK's; the show opens after two dress rehearsals which are available to the public. Having a permanent acting ensemble and their own workshop allows the theatre to take more risks, James suggests, as they are not hiring freelance cast and creatives for each production.

What else is different here? A better range of desserts on offer to audiences, a longer interval - all the more time to eat them - and the procedure for taking a bow, they explain. Also, much to Vize's delight, there are rarely dirty fingerprints left on her set. A stage cleaner regularly steps in during rehearsals. ""It's like an amazing sort of perfectionist dream.""

James and Vize say the pay is far greater than they are used to at home as Dailes is so well supported by the government; the subsidy it receives could pretty much cover the whole acting ensemble's salaries, explains KairiÅ¡s. Both MÄrtiÅÅ¡ Meiers (who plays Leo) and Madara ViÄ¼Äuka (who plays Rose as a teenager) are new to the ensemble. ViÄ¼Äuka has balanced her heart-wrenching Shakespearean role with some British-style farce courtesy of Peter Pan Goes Wrong, one of two Mischief Theatre comedies produced at Dailes this season. She also appeared in The Night of the Shining Princess by Latvian playwright Rainis (""he's our Shakespeare"") and Leopoldstadt directed by Malkovich, who has himself performed at the Dailes and hailed the ensemble as terrifically talented.

Meiers says he has found his roles ""extraordinarily demanding"", physically and emotionally. The pair agree it has been a rollercoaster start but that the ensemble quickly felt like family. ViÄ¼Äuka says that, as an actor, ""you can fool a lot of people, even sometimes lie to yourself, but when you're in a company working with the same people for years they know you - and know when you are fooling yourself. They'll tell you."" There is also a Latvian tradition of newer actors being assigned ""godparents"", Meiers explains: ""Someone you can talk to who will have a different perspective - actors are doubtful creatures.""

Big houses with ensembles still dominate the country's theatre culture but nimble, smaller independent companies are emerging. Meiers says that getting a placement in a repertory theatre after training used to be vital for a stage actor, but that's not quite the case any more.

In the past, the sheer size of the Dailes theatre has daunted some. Meiers says it makes or breaks young directors: ""It requires some sort of extraordinary talent to fill this space."" James ""had a precise vision"" of the story he wanted to tell, he adds.

""We've never had anything like this on the Latvian stage,"" KairiÅ¡s says of the audacious production. When he took over at the venue in 2020, he decided to showcase rising creative talent from across Europe rather than host established international megastars such as Van Hove. He likens it to a football club signing players: they don't have the deep pockets of the Bundesliga's Bayern Munich but are more like Borussia Dortmund, fielding future legends. He is also developing work with another of Van Hove's British associate directors, Daniel Raggett.

Dailes's internationalism helps to distinguish it from Riga's other venues which include Latvia's National theatre and the Mikhail Chekhov Riga Russian theatre, where KairiÅ¡s recently directed Hamlet: Wartime Chronicle, drawing a parallel between the war in Ukraine and the relationship between ""brother nations"" Denmark and Norway. ""We must be a real European theatre,"" he says of Dailes. ""We must sell European ideas to society because of Russia propaganda ... we still must fight for Europe, somehow.""

With opening night over, James boards a flight home the next day and - in another key cultural contrast - it turns out the actors will soon be leaving the theatre too. ""When the sun is shining, the tickets don't sell as well,"" says ViÄ¼Äuka. Winter's Tale will pause for summer along with most of the repetory.

We'll tell you what police are saying. From 299 queen street west. This is toronto's breaking news cp24. Good evening. I'm sijia liu. Thanks so much for joining us. Our top story tonight, toronto's pro-palestinian demonstrators who have been camped out at the university of toronto for weeks are presenting a counter-offer to school administrators tonight, we're just hours away from a deadline. University officials have set for clearing the encampment. Encampment spokesperson says the protesters work together on a list of demands and it hopes the university will quickly divest itself of investments in companies profiting from israel's offensive in gaza. The university issued a trespass notice to protesters on friday, which survey kate. The property by 8:00am monday. >> In the interest of transparency in correcting the record. We feel it's important to publicize are negotiating process. Offer. We're given by the administration on thursday. It's more for restatement of university policy that is an actual offer. Most of what was outlined in the document are processes that could have been initiated by students before the encampment before speaking to administration. The same processes that we know time again and then failure because president gertler has the authority to simply say no to the recommendation of a committee that he stacks himself. >> We, the students are steadfast in our demands for divestment, for disclosure and for cutting ties with israeli academic institutions complicit in israeli apartheid.

And also the feeling of safety to know that I'm amongst people care for me and care for my community. >> These are innocent people who were snatched from their homes on october some were brutalized before they were taken and they continue to be utilized while in captivity. We are demanding that they are now. My message to our elected leaders is to continue to put pressure on hamas to the hostages to lay down its arms because of that is the shortest wage and this conflict should be an actual ally to israel. Still has been a canadian ally for many, many years. >> We're not going to rest until they are returned home to their families and their lives are restored. And to you know, the folks are gathering here in the east end of toronto are standing shoulder to shoulder in solidarity to send that we are still thinking about those 125 hostages who have been taken from their families from their homes by hamas. We're not going to rest until they return home. >> To those who continue to be weather because they are that because they've seen the violence of the hit on street or whatever the reason might be speak because attack on the jewish community is attack on all of us.

And american man has been charged after a wheel smashed through the windshield of a bus on the qew in st. Catharines, killing a passenger.

Pro-palestinian demonstrators at the uft encampments will be meeting with school officials this evening for more negotiations. This as the deadline approaches for them to remove their camp. Cp24's andrew brennan joins us live with the latest. >> Despite a last-minute trip to the negotiating table in hopes of avoiding 8:00am tomorrow where this injunction is expected to be filed in court and protesters preparing for what would come next. What the demonstrators have said today's ultimately the offer given to them that by the university last week. And with the 24 hour deadline was one that was more of a regurgitation of the prior policy from the university. And on top of that, nothing substantially different than what was offered before their counter offer presented before the meeting. I said had indications of whining to sidestep what the university has said that they wanted to look at, including having working groups and advisory committees looking at possible ways of divesting from israeli institutions or from companies that the demonstrators here say are tied to the war in gaza or the israeli defence forces or disclosure of where

the university's money could b going now with that in mind, the looking ahead to 8:00am in the morning. University does say that they will be planning to file that injunction and potentially that could be enforced in days to come. The protesters say they're not expecting to be forced to leave any time soon. For one and 2, they have no plans to go anywhere either. This is what they were telling us today. >> We, the students are steadfast in our demands for divestment, for disclosure and for cutting ties with israeli academic institutions complicit in israeli apartheid. We remain steadfast in demand for palestine liberation. We demand u of complicity, we demand and complicity in israeli apartheid. We look forward to meeting with ut administrators at 5:00pm today to finally begin our negotiations. President gertler, we ask again for you to pick a side justice or genocide. >> Now similarly, a statement from the university did say they look forward ahead of these talks for what could be presently done at the bargaining table. But that statement that was received by cp24 earlier today goes on to say if the encampments remains non compliant compliance with the trespass notice we will be proceeding to court to seek injunctive relief through an urgent hearing. Now the demonstrators today did say that they believe they have a good chance of winning in court, pointing to other decisions like what happened at mcgill university, where there is an injunction sought by the university as well as the second one that came from some students, both of those being a turn down in court. Ultimately, the students here say they have a belief that they would win in court, but they also want the university and their mind to listen to them and take them seriously, which they say has not been happening up to this point. As for the offer that was originally presented on thursday into friday, with the deadline on friday from the university. Among the pieces of it included a no go on any eggs eggs emptying or I should say rather exit, not exempting any form of removing any relationships with israeli institutions. That could be either in east jerusalem or as protesters say, potentially tied to the war effort, something that did not provide any proof of at this time. But with all that in mind, proof, the offer that came from the university was turned down the counter offer presented before this meeting at 8:00am is coming soon. And there's a potential that this could last well beyond that. >> Thanks so much change or with that update. Meanwhile, a rally was held in the beaches today to demand the release of the remaining hostages being held by hamas. A few dozen people were joined by several politicians in the calling for the release of hostages at kew balmy beach. The rally was also to show support for the jewish community. Join the ongoing war. Israel says more than 100 people are still being held captive by hamas in gaza. >> The yellow shirts are actually the colour of the hostages. The awareness that the hostage families chose. So if you ever see on the streets of toronto, somebody wearing a yellow like that, that hostage pan and yellow is is the colour being used? >> I think a lot of people forget that there are real human connections there. Still 125 hostages who are held in captivity against her will a horrendous unspeakable atrocities have taken place and those are brothers and sisters, sisters, fathers, husbands, wives. >> They're real people and amidst all chaos and the politics of those people are being forgotten and they can't every level of government has a responsibility. >> To make sure that they are that they feel safe in that they are safe.

Andrew looks as though the encampment still very much there before but behind you rather, they have about till 8:00am tomorrow morning. But a lot happening between now and them. >> A lot happening, although the question is lindsay, will that change anything because ultimately as things stand right now, the people that have been in this encampment going on. 25 days hit nearly hitting 3, 3, a, I should say, hitting almost 4 weeks really that by this point, they have no plans on leaving. As things stand, even after 8:00am, they're not expecting to be wheeled out of here by police. At 8:00 on monday morning. They're expecting first of all that there, there will a court injunction that will be filed. That's happening, we know tomorrow morning. According to only the demonstrators. But what the university of toronto says its trespass notice, which is on the fence behind me that you notice of trespass. Now after that, potentially there could some form of removal in the days to come. That's what the expectation is, at least the plans are for the demonstrators here. But as you can see, looking at bird's eye view of the encampment shot today. One thing that's really has seemingly changes where the proposals are at the proposal from the university was said was turned down by that from protesters earlier on.

And this injunction with the court. And they've got the process of hiring a very expensive, very notorious law firm to do their bidding for them. And so it will probably take a couple days and we'll have to wait and see what the injunctions s. >> In the interest of transparency in correcting the record. We feel it's important to publicize are negotiating process. Offer. We're given by the administration on thursday. It's more for restatement of university policy that is an actual offer. Most of what was outlined in the document are processes that could have been initiated by students before the encampment. The force being to administration. The same processes that we know time and again and then failure because president gertler has the authority to simply say no to the recommendation of a committee that he stacks himself. >> Now as for the prospect in court with facing this injunction, one thing those 2 protesters who at the at the front of the, the meeting for the, the press conference earlier saying is they feel that they have good chances looking at what happened, for instance, at mcgill university in montreal, where there was 2 injunctions that were filed against the encampment. There. Both the both actually fall off failing in corsi encampment sticking around, even after both of those went through the legal process.

What the university says it plans to do is seek legal action to try to stop this encampment from continuing seeking an injunction from the courts to stop this encampment.

Good afternoon. I'm phil perkins. Thanks for joining us. Our top story. Police say one person has been injured in a stabbing at fairview mall near don mills and sheppard. They say they were called around 12 30 this afternoon about a woman who was stabbed by a man who is known to her while security was able to detain the suspect. Paramedics have since taken the woman hospital. They say her injuries are serious. And pro-palestinian demonstrators at the university of toronto cabbage will be meeting with school officials later today. For more negotiations. This as a deadline approaches for them to remove their camp. Cp24's andrew brennan joins us live with the latest standard. >> Well, phil, that deadline is a and tomorrow and one thing is based on how the university says it's going to be handling conceivably that demonstrators that are here in their tents, dozens upon dozens behind me here at king's college circle. What the university has said is that they will be filing an injunction in the morning at in the courts. And with that expectation, the demonstrators here say they have, they have no indication that there thinking are going to be any police officers kicking them off of campus and removing them and their tents tomorrow. They say that they will be steadfastly staying here, not just until they are, I told potentially forced potentially to leave, but that they wants to stay until their demands are met. And they shared some of those renewed demands with that. Fry with reporters today outside of simcoe hall just beside where we're standing right now. And those demands updated since the offer they got from the university, giving them this ultimatum of 8:00am on monday. It's take it or leave it, get out situation. The essential crux doubt it comes down to essentially changing between what the university is offering as in some cases, working groups or committees to look at some of the demands instead of support pointing towards the university's president and saying that he can unilaterally do a lot of the changes that they're asking for and removing the committee has something in the middle of their demands for boycotting. For instance, israeli institutions and those that they say would be a b tied to the war in gaza or looking at any divestments from universal for many israeli companies, that potentially could be part of the war or sanctions. They're

out. So that is essential changes that they've offered in their counterproposal. They'll be presenting that to the university administration later on today. As you mentioned, feel at 5:00pm. That meeting will take place. And then to 15 hours after that is when this deadline hits for them too. Leave without potential consequences. But they say they plan to stay. They also have a legal team that will be presenting their case in court as this injunction goes before a judge just for the university seeking that injunction. The weight you see at the core one thing, but also the wait and see here as to what could be happening in the coming days with this deadline fast approaching.

It's all for the toronto world partnership walk in support of the aga khan foundation. We'll let you know what to expect. From 299 queen street west. This is toronto's breaking news cp24. Hello. I'm melissa duggan. Durham police are investigating a fatal overnight crash. The collision happened just after 4:00am in the glen, born in grand view area police say the victim is female, but haven't released any further information about her age or identity. The circumstances of the crash still not clear. Police are investigating after shots were fired downtown overnight. Police say a gunshot was heard in the hallway of a condo near richmond. And peter officers located and arrested a suspect nearby following a short foot pursuit. A firearm was recovered. No injuries have been reported. Pro-palestinian demonstrators at the u of t encampment will be meeting with school officials later today. For more negotiations. This as a deadline approaches for them to remove their camp. Cp24's andrew brennan joins us now with all the latest. What are you hearing from protesters there? Andrew? >> Well, melissa, what will we will be hearing is a counter

proposal from demonstrators and we'll have that for our viewers later on into the afternoon. The other thing that we've been hearing from protesters at this encampment who have been here now for 3 and a half weeks. 24 days since made a second is the proposal offered by the administration in given out by the president in a press conference at the end of the week was ultimately not much different, not much to add versus what they have offered. The demonstrators that have been out here for 3 and a half weeks before includes having a working guide advisory committee be set a potentially to look at any forms of divestments. But that is something that the university ultimately says it has no plans to do. It does say it's open to potentially looking at disclosure, but there will be no boycott. When you look at the trifecta of and this goes back to about 2004, 2005. Just as gaza became more of an enclave at that time, there was a movement called bds boycott, divest and sanction. And that's I tactic used by pro-palestinian. Either demonstrators are palestinians themselves for about 20 years now. Now there is no plan according to the university, in their latest statement to look at any boycotts end of partnerships with israeli institutions. Academic or otherwise. We're starting to hear some of the loudspeakers coming out from this encampment that what the demonstrators have renamed king from king's college circle in to us. They circle for a free hollis 9 now, as I mentioned, they will be sharing some of their counter proposals and demands that they will be bringing to the table at 5:00pm with the administration. Also a press conference has been called for 11:30am tomorrow, which is following the deadline that was set by the administration and is on the notice of trespass on the front gates right behind me that just says says they want to see all of the demonstrators out by 8:00am conceivably indicating that the people that are here. Have no plans to leave despite the threat of legal proceedings. Now when it comes to potential injunction that could be filed against these demonstrators as a tactic that has been used before by other universities. And notably in the case of mcgill university, where there were 2 injunctions filed against the demonstrators there at that encampment. Both of those failed in recent weeks. Now, melissa will send it back to you and have more from the demonstrators and their demands. Coming up later on in the show. Yeah, the hours ahead will be consequential for this encampment at u of t andrew brennan will be bringing us more throughout the day. Thanks for that. Andrew. >> Looking overseas, rocket sirens were heard across central israel, including in tel aviv today. The sirens returning for the first time in months as hamas claims to have fired a barrage of rockets from gaza. >> The militants have continued to fire projectiles, communities around gaza, more than 7 months into the war, but have not fired longer-range rockets in months. No deaths or injuries have been reported. Trucks are entering gaza through southern israel today. The aid comes on the heels of a new agreement to bypass the rafah crossing with egypt on friday. The international court of justice ordered israel to open the rafah crossing to allow for the flow of aid. Egypt refuses to reopen its side of the rafah crossing until control of the gaza side is handed back to palestinians. Here at home. There's a flurry of activity happening down town today.

She scores! >> Roger: we could have our first ever pwhl champion tonight if minnesota beats boston in game four of the league final. [ ] >> You're watching ctv news channel. I'm roger peterson. We start with breaking news. Hamas's armed wing says it has launched a big missile attack on tel aviv. [ Sirens ] >> Air raid sirens could be heard in the city blaring for the first time in four months. According to reports, hamas fired rockets toward tel aviv signalling an escalation in the fight between the two sides. Hamas is claiming without evidence to have captured an israeli soldier during fighting in northern gaza. Something israel denies. >>> Aid trucks have begun entering gaza through southern israel. This following a new agreement. The rafah border was closed. -- under U.S. and israeli pressure is agreed to divert traffic through the crossing in israel's southern end. It is also gaza's main cargo terminal. It is still unclear if humanitarian groups will be able to access the aid because of fighting in the area.

>>> Let's bring in retired major general david fraser our ctv military analyst. General, thank you very much for joining us as always. >> Roger, good to be with you. >> Roger: this attack a missile launch from hamas. Are you surprised by that? >> Well, I'm not surprised, but at the same time it is well planned by hamas that they well techicly won't have much significance. Strategically just shows from the area that israel is attacking into rafah, hamas still has the ability to reach out and attack at tel aviv. So it is a political strategic strike more than a tactical one, but it also demonstrates they have the abilities not with standing the idf are right on the door steps to inflict damage on to tel aviv. Just showing a bit of the weakness of what the idf and the prime minister of israel is trying to do. >> Now they have been quiet for four months when it comes to any kind of missile attacks. Is there a reason for right now? A specific reason? >> I think that will be the question whether or not they have enough missiles and they are just harbouring what resources they have. The idf are getting to disclose that they don't want to lose the missiles. It could be any or all of the above. The fact of the matter remains is that, you know, they fired these and there will be a lot of questions to the idf and the israeli prime minister what will you do as a result of this. But for hamas it just shows that they are a lethal force. >> Roger: tel aviv not a surprising target? >> Its not. If you want to get people's attention. Look at us on a sunday morning we're talking about tel aviv. We're not talking about missile attacks into israel or anywhere else. We're talking about into the israeli capital. Not the capital but the major city. You know that is important for the israelis to deal with and to show that hamas still has a lot of punch left in it. So, this is a political statement. >> Roger: is there any way that israel can retaliate to this or they'll just continue their operations. Roger I think you know they'll just double down on their operations. You know for the israeli ground commanders they'll probably getting a lot of encouragement and pressure from the politicians to say finish this off. Get it done. You know, so we will see a lot more attacks into rafah. We will probably see a speeding up of the ground fighting which is bad news for the gazaens and bad news for that humanitarian aid. How do you get through the fighting to get it to the people who need it the most. Saying yes to the moving of aid through the southern israel port rather than rafah? >> I think, you know, it is from the egyptians point of view they can't go through rafah. It is in israeli hands. The problem there what will squirt out if they are trying to get into there. They can't sit on their hands and do nothing while the humanitarian crisis just carries on. So between the U.S. and egypt, you know, they have worked with israel to find another way in there and it is in the southern part of israel's borders which is an important aspect in trying to push the aid into the people who need it. It is an accommodation of acknowledgement of the relates in the war. Rafah is too dangerous now. >> Roger: does it give israel more control over what is going in, what aid is getting in. >> Israel has always controlled what was going in and coming out. And this just gives them to your point a lot more control because it is an israel controlled territory. >> Roger: thank you as always for your insight. >> Roger, thank you. >> Roger: to ukraine now where president zelenskyy is speaking about the importance of a peace summit to be held next month. >> To president biden, the leader of the united states, and to president xi, the leader of china, we do not want the un charter to be burned. Burned down just like that these books. >> Roger: in a prerecorded message, zelenskyy spoke inside the charged remains of a printing press burned down last week. In the ukrainian air strike. Russia has stepped up attacks on ukrainian cities and zelenskyy hopes the june meeting will help put more pressure on president putin

>>> Large bomb hit a construction supply store in the city of kharkiv saturday afternoon ending in a massive fire. The death toll from the attack is 14. Another 43 people were injured. 16 are missing still. Zelenskyy has said that over 200 people could have been in the store when it was hit. Ukraine's problems have been mounting in recent months as it tries to hold out against russia and the war appears to be at a critical point. >>> The death toll from that massive land slide in papa new guinea has increased. The un migration mission in the says that the up dated death toll follows another 100 homes buried in the debris. Initially they thought there was only 60. Now at 150 homes that were buried. They'll likely find more. The death toll on friday was 100 but that has jumped aways told you. Five bodies that's it have been recovered. The national government is saying that this may ask for more international assistance. >>> And in afghanistan, heavy rains triggering flash floods there. 15 people are dead including two parents and their eight children. That was in the north east of the country. The unusually heavy seasonal rains have been killing hundreds of people and destroying property and crops.

Do you have it in you to make it epic? [ ] >> Roger: all right. I am very excited about that. Let's bring in our film critic richard crouse. I love the mad max series. I can't even lie about it. This one looks great. Good morning. How are you? [ Laughter ] >> I'm good thanks. Nice to see. >> Roger: I was just drawn into the movie. >> That clip is great when chris hemsworth character in the film says do you have it in you to make it epic. He could be talking directly to director george miller who at 79 years old has delivered what will be the best action movie of the year. It is a prequel to mad max furiosa. Which came out about 10 years ago. That was the story of the warrior then played by -- this is now the origin story. How did they become furiosa.

she's played by anya taylor-joy in this version of the film. This is just pedalled to the meddle story telling. There is a scene in here called the stowaway. It is cut up into five different chapters. It reminded me of the old monster truck ads. That you would hear on late night television. You'll pay for the whole seat but only use the edge. Because I found myself moving closer to the screen to be immersed into the eye popping action that he has created here. It is really something. And the story is a little lighter than furry road because it takes place over 18 years rather than furry road's two or three days. Between the actors this is an entertaining day at the movies. >> Roger: does miller do mostly special affects? >> He keeps it to the minimum. That scene that I just told you about took 78 days to shoot because most of it is called practical. People on wires being flown around and that sort of thing. Not a lot of green screen work and anything that I think will look like it will take you out. My eye can spot cgi now and it kind of takes me out of the story. This drew me in because it feels real and it feels visceral. >> Roger: chris hemsworth? Having fun by the looks of it. >> Yeah. With a new nose. He has a different nose in it. He plays a war lord in this that has most of the movie's best lines. When he makes an entrance on a chariot that is being driven by three motorcycles it will stick in your mind. That's an image that stays with you. >> Roger: we have to move on. I would love to keep talking about this, but we're almost out of time. Quickly hit man another four star rating. >> One of my favourite movie from the last year's tiff. Glenn powell plays a person who impersonating hit men for the police. So that he can entrap people that want to kill a loved one or whatever. When I saw this movie there is a scene about three-quarters of a way through that is so well performed. It is funny. It is slap stick and a lot of things going on. The audience applauded during the movie. You don't see that often. It is called hit man. This should make glenn powell a super star. Because he is so good in it. Four out of five stars and in theaters now. >> Roger: we have to go richard, but you did you talked about quickly about gar field and three stars and babes is 3 and a half stars.

Watch free onCBC Gem. e]This is yourMarketplace. Have you been sold on the cold? [indistinct] [Charlsie]Plenty of peopleare boasting about the benefitsof cold plunging. But curing anxiety, losing weight, really? It's time to kill... or, should we say chill the buzz? In recent years, cold plunging has been heavily promoted. [lighthearted music playing] From dedicated practitioners with faithful followers... We are ableto defy inflammation. [Charlsie]...to the latestdirect to consumer offerings. [woman shrieking] Cold plunges aren't for everyone. [Charlsie]Denis Blondin has studied the effects of cold water as an associate professorof health science. [Denis] We've heard a lot of influencers getting really, really interested in cold plunges. We hear them repeat a lot of the same talking points, often based on really bad data. [Charlsie]So, let's thaw out some of those claims we're seeing on our feeds. [upbeat music playing] Can cold plunging help inflammation after a workout? It might be a benefit in some cases, or might be a hindrance in other cases. [Charlsie]Cold plunging after lifting weights can slow muscle recovery, reducing gains. But it might help you recover from endurance training faster. Can cold plunging help you lose weight? There's no evidence that cold will help you lose weight. [Charlsie] Can cold plunging help with depression or anxiety? There are some indications, yes, that it can. But I think there's more work that needs to be done. Thing is, being cold actually gives your body a similar physical response to a bit of exercise. Running up a flight of stairs can be a lot more comfortable and produce similar results. And that deep breathingtechnique taught by manyavid cold plungers... [breathing deeply] ...it's a form of meditation, and experts say that's wherea lot of the benefits people claim to experiencecan come from. [synthetic voice] Ice plunge with me. [Charlsie]Blondin also says ""Cold plunging can be unsafe."" This is so much [bleep] harder than it looks. We've heard of instances where people are doing cold water swimming and have drowned. It's not-- They haven't drowned because they can't swim. They drown from this strong cold shock response of this big gasp and this hyperventilation. [Charlsie]Cold plunges can put you into fight... or flight mode. It's why so many feel energized after a dip. But the cold water can also slow your heart rate and your body down. If you have any known or unknown heart issues, experts say you should not do it. If you cold plunge for longer, there's a risk you might become hypothermic, which you might not even realize. Blondin says ""One thing is clear, cold plunging is not a slam dunk, and more science is needed."" It really depends on the type of cold you're doing, how frequently you're doing it, how long you're doing it, so you can't kind of lump them all together. So, if you still want to give cold plunging a go, you're going to want to check with your doctor first. Ask if there's a family history of any cardiovascular issues. If the doctor gives you the all-clear, remember, don't go cold plunging alone. And keep it short. Asha:This season... What was the first indication that you'd been scammed?

Now with fighting in its 34 week, pressure is growing on the netanyahu government domestically. This was the scene in tel aviv as many people, including family members of those in captivity, say new negotiations need to take place. >> Reporter: what we've seen the last few hours is there were these meetings in paris between the C.I.A. chief, the israeli mossad chief, and the qatari prime minister. Next week, there's going to be talks between the same parties and egypt, and then hamas will be brought in. It's significant also because of the i.c.j., the international court of justice of israel to stop fighting and particularly -- particularly in gaza.

Remarks by a university of manitoba med school graduate are at the heart of this story. Dr. Gem newman urged graduates to speak out on the israel-hamas war as well as the actions of israel in gaza. Those condemning the remarks were earnest rady, the donor of the largest donation in the university's history. He called the speech ""hate and lies."" . Newman responded by saying it's ironic that demanding a ceasefire and calling for the rights of humans is considered hateful. >> Universities have faced major cutbacks from the public sector over the last couple of decades and are increasingly reliant on these things, and that's why they're taking this position. I think it's not particularly controversial to call for a ceasefire, and the donor has the right to withdraw that contribution. The problem is there's a power imbalance here and that the university really requires the funding, and so the honour gets more priority in this conversation. >> Deana: toronto police are looking for two suspects after finding evidence of gunfire at a jewish elementary school.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Kavakos returns to the Xinghai Concert Hall, embarking on a new challenge - performing the complete set of six Bach solo violin sonatas and partitas (commonly known as the ""Sonatas and Partitas""). In this work, Bach crafted virtually every chord and employed counterpoint techniques that are almost impossible to play, earning the ""Sonatas and Partitas"" the nickname ""Old Testament of Violin Works."" For any violinist, performing the complete ""Sonatas and Partitas"" is not only a test of technical and musical prowess but also a monumental challenge of physical and mental endurance.

True evil often begins with a masquerade. The most vicious regimes in history have depended on the pretensions of benevolence and the avowal of a higher purpose. The Kremlin asserts that Ukraine is not a country but part of Russia that was lost after the Soviet Union fell. This is untrue.

Russian President Vladimir Putin rules a nation and threatens the world. He does so by inculcating fear and luxuriating in indifference. America cannot be indifferent to this scourge, for Russian success in Ukraine will place Putin at the heart of an axis composed of Russia, China, and Iran. We must not allow this murderous phalanx to be revivified after having been weakened by the astute actions of the Trump administration.

Any accord that substantiates Russia's domination of Ukrainian provinces, including parts of the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson Oblasts, as well as Crimea, is unacceptable. The annexation of these Ukrainian territories, when coupled with Moscow's influence over Transnistria in Moldova since 1992 and its suzerainty over Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia since 2008, will set the template for China's invasion and intended dominion over Taiwan and areas of the South China Sea, for it would control parts of the First Island Chain.

For Iran, territorial domination may be represented not by an absolute command of foreign nations but through terrorist acts designed to destabilize Israel and the Arab Gulf states. Thus, anything resembling a Russian victory in Ukraine will resound across the world, imperiling free nations on distant continents.

Actions

Decisiveness and intrepidity by the United States are required, not lassitude and perplexity. U.S. President Joseph Biden promised to burnish other nations' respect for America at his inauguration. Nevertheless, his administration made several critical errors in its first year, with disastrous repercussions. It executed a deadly and calamitous retreat from Afghanistan that both armed and invigorated our nation's enemies; risked our energy independence to please environmental extremists; fortified the Kremlin by restricting American hydrocarbon production and approving the Russian Nordstream II pipeline; and impaired Saudi Arabia by delisting Iran's Houthi proxies as a terrorist organization. The Houthis remain the scion of Iran, the rogue state with which the president sought to reestablish a discredited nuclear agreement.

Should the Biden administration's failings continue, such enfeeblement may serve to greenlight the next war by demonstrating a weakness of purpose and negligence in planning. We must contest aggression, not signal our incapacity to forestall it.

Decisiveness can be defined as unrepressed action pursuant to an objective. Clustered around this word are others: resolve, certainty, determination, firmness, grit, and power. These are words Putin understands. Anything resembling negotiation constitutes nothing but a mask or pause that the Kremlin will repurpose to realize its goals of expansion, occupation, and domination.

President Donald Trump exemplified decisiveness in his contestation of China and Iran, in his termination of Major General Qasem Soleimani, the murderous head of Iran's Quds Force, and in his establishment of the Abraham Accords. I, therefore, believe that when Donald Trump speaks of ending the war in Ukraine in one day, he refers to his plan for resolute and immutable action in his conduct of America's international relations and not to any accommodation of Moscow's aims. It is decisive American support for Ukraine that will end the war on terms acceptable to Ukraine and NATO.

Had President Trump won the 2020 election, it is extraordinarily doubtful that Putin would have had the temerity to invade Ukraine in 2022, for the abhorrent and ill-planned retreat from Afghanistan would not have occurred. Though we cannot undo the past, we should be mindful of our words. It is one thing to say that protecting America's borders is of equal or greater importance than protecting Ukraine's. It makes no sense to argue, however, that if money is not allocated to protect America's borders, Ukraine's should be left molested. That is akin to cutting off one's nose to spite his face. It is logically deficient since it ensures the worst possible outcome in each domain.

Wisely, the House of Representatives rejected this trap and passed a crucial bill to support Ukraine on April 20, 2024. Legislators from both parties joined together in their appreciation of freedom, understanding that apathy, fear, and isolation do not define strategy; they presage defeat.

In Ukraine, men and women of extraordinary courage sacrifice themselves to secure liberty for their children and fellow citizens, and they deserve our most sincere support. Field Manual No. 3-0 was publicly distributed by the U.S. Army on October 1, 2022. It stipulates a defining principle of combat, namely the importance of mass, or the integration of ""all the elements of combat power and synchronizing their application against a decisive point.""

Mass and concentration can create ""overwhelming combat power at specific locations to support the main effort."" Regrettably, despite the positive steps taken by Congress, these precepts are absent from President Biden's policies.

In his classic treatise on strategy, Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz argued that in war, it is imperative not to waste time. The Biden administration's recalcitrance in providing heavy armaments to Ukraine wasted precious time as it hindered Kyiv's decisive application of mass.

If the weapons that were subsequently supplied to Ukraine had been delivered in a timely manner, a pivotal advantage would have been conveyed to Ukraine. Long-range missiles are essential to modern warfare but were not provided in the first year of combat. Such weapons are vital to hold Russian formations at risk, thereby greatly complicating the Kremlin's plans for enveloping engagements.

In the aftermath of Russia's invasion on February 24, 2022, portable weapons, which included the Javelin anti-tank missile provided by the Trump administration, should have been bolstered immediately by the delivery of M1 tanks -- held in storage -- as well as fourth-generation fighter aircraft, such as the F-16. The early introduction of the M1 and other comparable German and British tanks would have allowed Ukraine to institute more effective combined arms[7] [RL8] tactics, fusing these heavy tanks with infantry and other vital components of warfare before the proliferation of Russian drone swarms, which must now be countered.

The F-16 first flew in 1974. Only now, years after Russia's invasion, are a number of these planes headed to Ukraine. Had significant quantities of technologically advanced systems been transferred to Ukraine immediately after Russia's invasion, such rapidity would have saved lives by facilitating Ukraine's mastery of the battlespace.

Commitment

By supporting Ukraine, we prevent a larger European war that may involve America's military due to our Article 5 treaty commitment to the integrity of NATO member states. By helping Ukraine, we prevent Russia's reconstitution of its old empire, which would act in accordance with Iran and China, to dictate world fossil-fuel prices, causing cascading economic strife in America and across the globe.

Freedom is not an afterthought. It is a rare condition throughout history and remains the most precious commodity that humanity has ever attained. In light of the stakes involved, we must allow Ukraine to dictate the terms of any peace. The global geostrategic dangers leave our nation no choice but to support Ukraine's crusade to recapture all of its territory.

Context

Sweden's and Finland's ascension to NATO membership mandates our consideration of the post-war European landscape. The Three Seas Initiative and other groups of nations that border Ukraine must consider shared security goals after Russia's objectives are defeated. Such steps constitute a necessary prologue to NATO membership for Ukraine, which can only be realized after victory and the establishment of borders that are permanent and free of Russian intrusion.

By empowering Ukraine to reestablish control over its sovereign territory, we rupture China's designs against Taiwan, thus helping to prevent an assault that would shatter the living standards of the world by crippling supplies of essential goods such as semiconductors. Therefore, we must act in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity lest we undercut our nation's own interests.

By aiding Ukraine, we undermine the creation of a Chinese-Russian axis bent on exerting military and economic hegemony, which would devastate our economy. In the Middle East and Africa, a Chinese-Russian axis would fuse with Iran and other terrorist forces to form a machine of conquest and influence.

The calamitous war in Ukraine is the result of Russia's mechanisms of subjugation, which have been allowed to feed on the world's (Europe's in particular) demands for natural gas and other hydrocarbons. Russia's energy sector, which rests on oil, coal, and natural gas revenue, funds a significant part of its federal budget.

If Russia is allowed to exert dominion over the Donbas and Ukraine's coast, the Kremlin will next seek to control the energy resources of other independent countries that were once part of the Soviet Empire. Russia will become a juggernaut, dominating fossil fuels in addition to its present lead in supplying nuclear power plants to recipient nations across the globe. This is what is at risk. It is thus imperative that the principles of American military and energy dominance be advanced, as must our restraint in the use of force that commits our country to battle, for our nation's armed forces must not fight in Ukraine.",nationalinterest.org,news,The National Interest,,-0.2392156862745098,454100221,5,https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/Ukraine_War_SS.jpg,

Kharkiv spent over 16 hours under air raid overnight into today.

16 May 2024 - 20:12

Dear Ukrainians!

Today, in the first half of the day, I was in the Kharkiv region. First of all, to address defense issues and protection of people.

I held a meeting of the Staff in Kharkiv, involving the Commander-in-Chief, commanders of directions, heads of the security sector - the Defense Intelligence, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Security Service, the State Border Guard Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the heads of the Kharkiv region. Thus, all aspects of the situation were considered. We discussed in detail the combat operations in the Kharkiv region, the protection of people, our positions, and the needs of the units that defend our positions. Now, thanks to our Forces, our measures, we have managed to build confidence in the direction of Vovchansk. However, Russian shelling and threats persist. Today, in particular, the head of the Vovchansk administration was wounded. Our counterattacks are ongoing, including in other parts of the Kharkiv border area. And there should be more results in repelling the assaults, in destroying the occupier. Russia is trying to expand the war, invariably accompanying it with empty words about peace. We must force Russia into a real, just peace by all means. In this context, our defense against assaults and attacks is crucial.

Today's meeting also included reports on the occupier's further intentions - we are preparing for all scenarios.

Today we also thoroughly analyzed the situation in the Donetsk region - on the relevant fronts. Pokrovsk, Kramatorsk, and others. There, the greatest number of combat encounters and the toughest conditions are observed. Of course, we are not neglecting this direction.

And we are thoroughly working with our partners to provide Kharkiv, Donetsk, Sumy, and other regions with more basic protection, namely air defense systems and sufficient long-range weapons. Upon my return to Kyiv, I spoke with Polish Prime Minister Tusk. We talked about our needs, about Patriot systems that could significantly change the situation in the Kharkiv direction. We also discussed the Russian terrorist attacks on our regions in the western part of Ukraine - the threat that attacks on gas infrastructure pose to everyone in Europe, not only to us but also to our neighbors. We must work together to counter this. I would also like to thank Denmark today - there is a new defense package worth â¬750 million to bolster our air defense and artillery. This is a timely decision, and I greatly appreciate it.

And one more thing.

Today I had the honor to personally award our warriors who are defending the Kharkiv direction. It is very important. The 57th, 42nd, and 92nd brigades. The warriors of the special forces of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine - I am grateful to each of you guys! Each of our soldiers, each sergeant, each officer - the bravery of each determines our common destiny. I am grateful to everyone who does everything for our state to withstand! I thank everyone in the world who helps!

Glory to Ukraine!

Denmark announced a new military aid package to Ukraine valued at 5.6 billion DKK (â¬750 million).

The package includes DKK 2.4 billion for strengthening Ukraine's air defense as well as additional contributions for the upcoming F-16 donation, and financial contributions for the donation of additional artillery pieces, shells, and anti-tank mines.

We are grateful to Denmark for their unwavering support.

Thank you for helping Ukraine win this war!

According to the German Minister of Defence Boris Pistorius, Lithuania is contributing to the German IAAD initiative which aims to strengthen the Ukrainian air defence with six AMBER-1800 air surveillance radars. He did not provide any further details such as a planned delivery date.

An overview of the initiative â¬ï¸

Germany: 1 Patriot battery

Lithuania: 6 AMBER-1800 air surveillance radars

Belgium: â¬200 million

The Netherlands: â¬150 million

Denmark: â¬134 million (for financing a Patriot battery)

Canada: ~â¬52 million (for financing IRIS-T (SL) missiles)

Today is Vyshyvanka Day, celebrating the traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt.

Visible or invisible, it is always under a defender's pixel, a rescuer's uniform, a medic's coat, a power engineer's jacket, a volunteer, a teacher, or anyone who holds the defense.

Our children have known it since infancy. It represents the unity of all generations of Ukrainians over the centuries. Its pattern is unique because it is embroidered by our own actions on a canvas of our values.

Over the years of our resistance to aggression, it has become an informal uniform for all those who defend humanity, freedom, and the right to self-identity.

Happy Vyshyvanka Day to Ukraine, all Ukrainians, and Ukraine's friends around the world! ðºð¦

Here is Mikhail Khodorkovsky's assessment of the strategic situation in Ukraine. First tweet from the thread, the rest from the Thread Reader App:

Residents of Kharkiv have been monitoring reports with increasing urgency for the past five days as a new Russian offensive edges closer to the city. The stresses of war are nothing new to the Kharkiv population, which has been under daily bombardment since the start of the current year. Nevertheless, the opening of a new front less than half an hour's drive from the city's northern suburbs has raised the stakes dramatically.

Since the Russian offensive began last Friday, harrowing footage of burning villages and fleeing civilians has flooded social media, adding to the sense of mounting danger. Evacuation efforts are still underway in the border region, with around 8000 people so far brought from nearby communities to Kharkiv.

So far, Russian troops have made modest progress, advancing up to eight kilometers into Ukraine and capturing a number of Ukrainian villages. While the incursion is currently regarded as too small in scale to threaten Kharkiv itself, the reappearance of Russian soldiers in the region for the first time since 2022 has sparked considerable alarm and dismay.

Russia's new offensive did not come as a complete surprise, of course. On the contrary, the build-up of Russian troops across the border had been common knowledge for weeks. Kharkiv Regional Council member and political sciences professor Halyna Kuts says she has been preparing for some time, and has a bag of emergency items packed and ready.

Kuts is one of many people in Kharkiv to express anger at restrictions preventing Ukraine from using Western weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Due to fears of possible Russian retaliation, most of Kyiv's partners insist the military aid they supply only be used within Ukraine's borders. These restrictions prevented Ukraine from attacking concentrations of Russian troops as they prepared for the current offensive. ""We could have destroyed them, but we were not allowed to,"" says Kuts.

With Russian troops now gradually moving toward the city, Kuts believes the only option is to ""dig in"" and prepare to defend Kharkiv. ""This is no longer a center of culture and science; this is a military fortress. Everyone should be carrying a gas mask, bandages, and water with them at all times,"" she says.

In recent days, it has become much rarer to encounter children on the streets of the city. Some families have now left Kharkiv due to the deteriorating security situation, heading west for the relative safety of Poltava, Kyiv, or beyond. Youngsters who remain are obliged to attend classes underground or online.

Defiance can be expressed in different ways. For Halyna Kuts, this means proceeding with Kharkiv's annual Vyshyvanka Day parade on May 16 in one of the city's underground metro stations. This colorful annual event, which features people sporting Ukraine's traditional embroidered shirts, is widely seen as a celebration of Ukrainian patriotism and national identity. With Russian troops advancing toward the city, Kuts says it is now more important than ever to host this year's parade as planned.

""Lacking sufficient forces and with a deficit of ammunition, Ukraine's military responds to Russian breakthroughs by moving its best brigades and elite units around the front. This firefighting approach, which happened during the battles of Bakhmut and Avdiika, means that the best units do not have enough time to rest and regenerate.""

Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko states that terrorist formations of the so-called ""russia"" are taking civilians hostage in the northern section of Vovchans'k, to hold them in basements. Some of them were executed.

We have already seen this many times when terrorists, struggling to complete their objectives, take it out on civilians.

Clearly, Russian terrorist formations are following the example of their ""colleagues"" who organised similar events in Bucha and other towns of Ukraine and were later given state awards for these massacres.

Here is Tatarigami's and his Frontelligence Insight team's battle damage assessment of the strike on the Belbek airbase. From the Thread Reader App:

The consequences of these events are yet to be fully comprehended, and they are likely to have profound long-term implications.

Following the Kremlin shakeup and the replacement of Shoigu with Belousov, a figure from the so-called ""economic"" or ""technocratic"" circles, there has been speculation about the nature of these changes and Shoigu's future role. Today, Shoigu appeared alongside Putin during his visit to China, though this isn't the main focus of our discussion. The composition of this delegation might give us a lot of critical details and its goals.

In addition to Putin, Shoigu, Lavrov, Peskov, and the newly appointed Belousov, the expanded Russian delegation includes:

Minister of Natural Resources and Environment,

Head of the Central Bank, Minister of Economic Development, Minister of Finance, Director of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service, CEO of Rosatom,

Director of the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, First Deputy Prime Minister, Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration

Furthermore, key representatives of businesses and oligarchs are part of the expanded delegation.

- Oleg Deripaska, oligarch and founder of RUSAL

- Igor Sechin, oligarch, CEO of Rosneft

- Herman Gref, Chairman of Sberbank's Executive Board

- Andrey Kostin, President-Chairman of VTB Bank

- Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund

- Leonid Mikhelson, Chairman of NOVATEK

- Igor Shuvalov, Chairman of VEB.RF

- Alexander Shokhin, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP)

Such a list of decision-makers from the financial and economic sectors suggests that this delegation is not ordinary but rather an ambitious and serious effort to deepen economic and financial cooperation with China. Given the presence of the newly appointed Minister of Defense and the Director of the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, we should also anticipate discussions on military-industrial cooperation.

This should not be dismissed as a routine event. The last time Shoigu visited North Korea, Russia received millions of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. However, unlike that delegation, this one is heavily represented by the financial and economic sectors, suggesting Russia's serious intent to address economic and financial problems caused by war.

Given China's pragmatism and Russia's weakened position, successful negotiations may require significant concessions or unfavorable long-term agreements for Russia. That being said, the successful outcome of these negotiations will create problems for Ukraine regardless, as Russia is clearly aiming to outproduce the West and Ukraine.

I'll leave detailed economic discussions to specialists in their respective fields, but it's evident that this could have significant global implications and will likely have a tangible impact on the ongoing war for years to come.

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses - and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermine its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

Advertisement

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday It will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

Earlier this month alberta rcmp and calgary police revealing they connected the murders of 4 calgary women and girls to an american serial killer. Retired calgary police homicide detective joins us in studio to talk about the file and the search for more victims. Good morning thank you for joining us. >> Good morning tracy. >> Tracy: what was your reaction when you heard this news? >> I was really proud. I know there is crimes investigators across the country that work hard every day to try to bring resolution to these files and I felt an immense pride for the group hearing calgary that was part of that. >> Tracy: okay,, and we talk than about this new forensic tool that's being used, investigative jun a genealogy. >> Yes so really what it does is sort of a collaboration between investigators and genealogists to try to help some of these very old files. You know, the first time it was ever used was in the united states with the golden state killer. That technique was led to the identification of that individual many years later. Since then, ingenuity of investigators here even in canada have taken it upon themselves to applied to some of their historical cases. And with great success. >> Tracy: so this tool has been used in other files in order to slow cases. >> It certainly has. Really what they are doing is mapping the suspect through family trees essentially. It is a collaborative approach with the genealogist and investigator family trades to try to identify who it belongs to ended sat for many years. >> Tracy: so many officers of the seventies had the foresight to collect this evidence even though it wasn't really being used at that point. >> I think they have the foresight to just keep it, you know, I don't think anybody back in the seventies necessarily new that would get to this point. Really dna technology has advanced so much from us 25 years and it was really only being applied in the mid-nineties. You need so much dna then and now just very little. And his that we are at the point now or we can track some into the dna profile at family lineages but that's what genetic genealogy actually is. >> Tracy: not touched on this but what due something with this mean for investigators now and people who worked on and some of the years ago. >> I think it would mean a lot to the investigative teams that were involved in this particular 1 for sure. They should be vary proud of their efforts and achievements that weigh. But I also think it must mean the tongue for the families themselves who are also impacted have been this hanging over them for so long. >> Tracy: moving forward then and looking into what investigators are doing that might possibly link more cases back to him, what steps we'll be taken? >> I imagine they will be looking at other crimes that they suspect he may have committed. If there is dna on file using that dna and evidence to try to link him that weigh they'll also look at the method of operation and behaviours seen in other crimes to compare them to what they saw here. So there we'll be I'm sure great effort to try to track them over the coming on some potentially years. >> And I was going to say how long do you think it would take for more cases to start being linked to this? >> I think it is hard to say but there we'll be submissions obviously to the dna databank now that they know who their suspect is in relation to these cases. And from there they will wait to see whether there are matches to other unsolved files. >> Tracy: tape thank you for your time this morning. >> Thank you tracy. >> Tracy: for more information or to get in contact with dave you can visit unconventional

The People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation (hereinafter referred to as the ""Parties""), declare as follows:

ONE

In 2024, China and Russia will grandly celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Over the past 75 years, China-Russia relations have gone through an extraordinary development process. The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China recognized the Russian Federation as the legal successor state of the Soviet Union and reiterated its willingness to develop Sino-Russian relations on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and mutually beneficial cooperation. The ""Treaty of Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation"" signed on July 16, 2001 laid a solid foundation for the continued and comprehensive strengthening of Sino-Russian relations. The positioning of bilateral relations has been continuously improved, reaching the highest level in history of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination for a New Era. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of both sides, China-Russia relations follow the national interests of both countries, uphold the spirit of permanent good-neighborliness and friendship, and maintain healthy and stable development.

Both sides pointed out that the current Sino-Russian relations transcend the military and political alliance model of the Cold War and are non-aligned, non-confrontational and not directed against third parties. In the face of the turbulent and changing world landscape, China-Russia relations have withstood the test of the changing international situation, highlighted their characteristics of stability and resilience, and are at the best level in history. The two sides emphasized that developing the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples. It is not a temporary measure, is not affected by temporary events, and has strong endogenous driving force and independent value. Both sides resolutely defend their legitimate rights and interests and oppose any attempt to obstruct the normal development of bilateral relations, interfere in the internal affairs of the two countries, and restrict the economic, technological and international space of the two countries.

The two sides reaffirmed that China and Russia have always regarded each other as priority partners, always adhered to mutual respect, equal treatment, and win-win cooperation, and always abided by the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the basic norms of international relations. They have become major powers in the world and each other's largest neighbors. A model for relationships. The two sides are willing to further deepen comprehensive strategic coordination, firmly support each other on issues involving each other's core interests such as sovereignty, territorial integrity, security and development, reasonably and effectively leverage their respective advantages, focus on safeguarding the security and stability of their respective countries, and promote development and revitalization. The two sides will abide by the principles established in the China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation signed on July 16, 2001, as well as other bilateral documents and statements, and carry out high-quality, high-level mutually beneficial cooperation in a wide range of areas.

China welcomes the successful presidential election of the Russian Federation in March 2024. It believes that this election is highly organized, open, objective and universal. The results fully demonstrate that the national policies pursued by the Russian government have broad support and that the same development trend has been achieved. Friendly relations with the People's Republic of China are an important part of Russia's foreign policy.

China strongly condemns all the organizers, perpetrators and planners of the inhumane terrorist attack in Moscow Oblast on March 22, 2024, believes that attacks on civilians are completely unacceptable, and supports Russia in resolutely combating terrorist and extremist forces and safeguarding national peace. Stablize.

Russia reiterated its adherence to the one-China principle, recognized Taiwan as an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, opposed any form of ""Taiwan independence,"" and firmly supported China's measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieve national reunification. China supports Russia in safeguarding its security, stability, development and prosperity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and opposes external forces interfering in Russia's internal affairs.

The two sides pointed out that major changes in the world are accelerating, the status and strength of emerging powers in the ""Global South"" countries and regions are constantly increasing, and the multi-polarization of the world is accelerating. These objective factors accelerate the redistribution of development potential, resources, opportunities, etc. in a direction that is beneficial to emerging markets and developing countries, and promote the democratization of international relations and international fairness and justice. Countries that adhere to hegemonism and power politics run counter to this and attempt to replace and subvert the recognized international order based on international law with a ""rules-based order."" The two sides emphasized that China's concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind and a series of global initiatives are of great and positive significance.

As independent forces in the process of building a multipolar world, China and Russia will fully tap the potential of their relations, promote the realization of an equal and orderly world multipolarity and the democratization of international relations, and pool their strength to build a fair and reasonable multipolar world.

Both sides believe that all countries have the right to independently choose development models and political, economic and social systems based on their national conditions and the will of their people, and oppose interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries, and oppose unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" that have no basis in international law and are not authorized by the Security Council."" and oppose drawing ideological lines. The two sides pointed out that neocolonialism and hegemonism completely went against the trend of the times, and called for equal dialogue, the development of partnerships, and the promotion of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations.

Both sides will continue to firmly defend the victory of World War II and the post-war world order enshrined in the United Nations Charter, and oppose the denial, distortion and tampering of the history of World War II. Both sides pointed out that it is necessary to educate the correct view of history, protect the world's anti-fascist memorial facilities from desecration or damage, and severely condemn the beautification of, or even attempts to revive, Nazism and militarism. The two sides plan to grandly celebrate the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the Soviet Union's Patriotic War in 2025, and jointly promote the correct [i.e., truthful] historical view of World War II.

TWO

The two sides will take the lead of heads of state diplomacy to promote the all-round development of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era. The two sides will fully implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, continue to maintain close high-level exchanges, ensure the smooth operation of government, local and non-governmental exchange mechanisms, and actively study and create new cooperation channels.

The two sides will continue to carry out exchanges between the leaders of the legislative bodies of the two countries, deepen cooperation between the parliamentary cooperation committees, joint working groups, special committees, and parliamentary friendship groups of the two countries, and maintain exchanges and cooperation between the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Office of the President of the Russian Federation. Carry out mutual trust dialogue within the framework of strategic security consultation and law enforcement security cooperation mechanisms to promote exchanges between the political parties of the two countries as well as non-governmental and academic circles.

Investigative historian Eric Zuesse's latest book, AMERICA'S EMPIRE OF EVIL: Hitler's Posthumous Victory, and Why the Social Sciences Need to Change, is about how America took over the world after World War II in order to enslave it to U.S.-and-allied billionaires.

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses - and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermine its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday It will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

>>> So in the past four days there have been five homicides in montreal. Just last night, three people killed in a brawl and one of them was only 15 years old. Ctv's genevieve beauchemin joins us now. Gen, are these incidents connected at all? What more are police saying about the violence? >> Reporter: yes, merella, and what's so startling to police is so many of these murders are unrelated to gang violence, including the one is that happened right here, the triple murder that unfolded in front of so many people in their apartments -- one that happened. >> Reporter: on tuesday night, around 15 people were involved in a violent brawl in the alley.

For instance, in 2022, montreal had fewer murders per 100,000 inhabitants than winnipeg, vancouver, halifax, and toronto. And past spikes of violence here were most often related to turf wars over the control of the drug trade. Since last year, montreal police have cracked down on gun crimes, but several of the recent murders seem to be based on personal conflict including a fight between neighbours over music and last night's ball. Now, police are trying to pinpoint exactly what happened. They have a lot of surveillance videos, good quality ones to go through to determine exactly who was here at the time.

The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, adopted by the Commission on 9 March 2023 and amended on 20 November 2023, to support measures in sectors which are key to accelerate the green transition and reduce fuel dependencies.

The Spanish measure

Spain notified to the Commission, under the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, a â¬1.1 billion scheme to support investments for the production of relevant equipment necessary to foster the transition to a net-zero economy.

Under this measure, which will be funded through the Recovery and Resilience Facility (""RRF""), the aid will take the form of direct grants.

The measure will be open to companies producing relevant equipment, namely batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat-pumps and electrolysers, as well as key components designed and primarily used as direct input for the production of such equipment or related critical raw materials necessary for their production.

The Commission found that the Spanish scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework. In particular, the aid (i) will incentivise the production of relevant equipment for the transition towards a net-zero economy; and (ii) will be granted no later than 31 December 2025.

The Commission concluded that the Spanish scheme is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to accelerate the green transition and facilitate the development of certain economic activities, which are of importance for the implementation of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, in line with Article 107(3)(c) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework.

On this basis, the Commission approved the aid measure under EU State aid rules.

Background

Other aid measures for accelerated investments in sectors strategic for the transition towards a net-zero economy have been approved by the Commission on 9 October 2023 (SA.108953), 28 July 2023 (SA.107689), 19 July 2023 (SA.108068) and 26 May 2023 (SA.107094).

On 9 March 2023, the Commission adopted a new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework to foster support measures in sectors which are key for the transition to a net-zero economy, in line with the Green Deal Industrial Plan. The Framework amends and prolongs in part the Temporary Crisis Framework, adopted on 23 March 2022, to enable Member States to use the flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine.

The Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework has been amended on 20 November 2023 to prolong by six months a limited number of sections aimed at providing a crisis response following Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the unprecedented increase in energy prices.

The Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, as amended, provides for the following types of aid, which can be granted by Member States:

Limited amounts of aid (section 2.1), in any form and granted until 30 June 2024, for companies affected by the current crisis or by the subsequent sanctions and countersanctions up to â¬280,000 and â¬335,000 in the agriculture, and fisheries and aquaculture sectors respectively, and up to â¬2.25 million in all other sectors;

Liquidity support in form of State guarantees and subsidised loans (sections 2.2 and 2.3). In exceptional cases and subject to strict safeguards, Member States may provide to energy utilities for their trading activities public guarantees exceeding 90% coverage, where they are provided as unfunded financial collateral to central counterparties or clearing members. These sections are applicable only until 31 December 2023 and have not been amended;

Aid to compensate for high energy prices (section 2.4). The aid, which can be granted in any form in principle until June 2024, will partially compensate companies, in particular intensive energy users, for additional costs due to exceptional gas and electricity price increases. The individual aid amount may be calculated based on either past or present consumption, taking into account the need to keep market incentives to reduce energy consumption and to ensure the continuity of economic activities. In addition, Member States may provide support flexibly, including to particularly affected energy-intensive sectors, subject to safeguards to avoid overcompensation and to incentivise the reduction of the carbon footprint in case of aid amounts above â¬50 million. Member States are also invited to consider, in a non-discriminatory way, setting up requirements related to environmental protection or security of supply. Further details on the support possibilities for high energy prices, including on the methodology to calculate individual aid amounts, are available here;

Measures accelerating the rollout of renewable energy (section 2.5). Member States can set up schemes for investments in all renewable energy sources, including renewable hydrogen, biogas and biomethane, storage and renewable heat, including through heat pumps, with simplified tender procedures that can be quickly implemented, while including sufficient safeguards to protect the level playing field. In particular, Member States can devise schemes for a specific technology, requiring support in view of the particular national energy mix. The conditions for the granting of aid to small projects and less mature technologies, such as renewable hydrogen, have been simplified by lifting the need for a competitive bidding process, subject to certain safeguards. Under such schemes, aid may be granted until 31 December 2025; after that date, the usual State aid rules will continue to apply, including in particular the corresponding provisions of the Climate, Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines (CEEAG);

Measures facilitating the decarbonisation of industrial processes (section 2.6). To further accelerate the diversification of energy supplies, Member States can support investments to phase-out from fossil fuels, in particular through electrification, energy efficiency and the switch to the use of renewable and electricity-based hydrogen which complies with certain conditions, with expanded possibilities to support the decarbonisation of industrial processes switching to hydrogen-derived fuels. Member States can either (i) set up new tender-based schemes, or (ii) directly support projects, without tenders, with certain limits on the share of public support per investment. Specific top-up bonuses are foreseen for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as for particularly energy efficient solutions. In the absence of tenders, a further simpler method has been introduced to determine the level of maximum support. Under such schemes, aid may be granted until 31 December 2025; after that date, the usual State aid rules will continue to apply, including in particular the corresponding provisions of the CEEAG;

Measures aimed at supporting electricity demand reduction (section 2.7), in line with the Regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices, until 31 December 2023;

Measures to further accelerate investments in key sectors for the transition towards a net-zero economy (section 2.8), enabling investment support for the manufacturing of strategic equipment, namely batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat-pumps, electrolysers and carbon capture usage and storage as well as for production of key components and for production and recycling of related critical raw materials. More specifically, Member States may until 31 December 2025 design simple and effective schemes, providing support capped at a certain percentage of the investment costs up to specific nominal amounts, depending on the location of the investment and the size of the beneficiary, with higher support possible for small and medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs') as well as companies located in disadvantaged regions, to ensure that cohesion objectives are duly taken into account. Furthermore, in exceptional cases, Member States may provide higher support to individual companies, where there is a real risk of investments being diverted away from Europe, subject to a number of safeguards. More information on the support possibilities for measures to accelerate the transition to a net-zero economy can be found here.

It has been a long week. Everyone is, I'm sure worn out. So far, Rosie seems to be tolerating her third chemo treatment much better than her first two. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, kind wishes, and prayers for her. Also, there was a misfire with the GoFundMe. Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know. But I do want anyone who did donate and who is getting a refund to know that I appreciate what you did very, very, very much!

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

9 May 2024 - 20:41

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

â¡ï¸Germany to buy 3 HIMARS for Ukraine.

â¡ï¸Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin is strangling Ukraine's economy by knocking out much of its electricity generation and wearing down the civilian population by bombing cities. Kharkiv, which is already rationing electricity, is being hit by glide bombs almost daily. Yet the city of more than 1m people is keeping calm and carrying on. On a sunny afternoon last week, residents strolled through a park and attendants went on emptying rubbish bins, even as two glide bombs landed with huge explosions less than a kilometre away. Keeping the city functioning and clean is a way to stand up to destruction and chaos.

With around 50,000 fresh Russian troops gathering across the border some 40km away, Kharkiv's commanders know they may be a target in Russia's next push. One scenario would be to isolate the city by cutting the main road to Kyiv. Another would be to move some 10km closer, putting the city's eastern outskirts within artillery range and creating a buffer zone to protect Belgorod, a Russian city that is being hit by Ukrainian drones.

Konstantin Nemichev is the commander of the famous Kraken regiment, a special-forces outfit formed in the early days of the invasion in 2022 that defended Kharkiv. He expects the enemy to attack the province again in mid-May, but reckons they will fail to get near the city. Interviewed outside a ruined school building in the east of town, the site of an intense firefight in 2022 in which invading soldiers were wiped out, the commander says the defence is much stronger now. It has three lines of fortifications and a full brigade to stop the Russians. ""They can move a few kilometres into the province,"" he says, ""but I don't think they can get as far as 10km.""

The Ukrainian armed forces know they have no choice but to fight on. ""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region. But this sense of urgency and existential threat, he says, needs to penetrate into the whole of Ukrainian society. ""People need to know the truth,"" he says. And Ukraine needs unity as it enters a new stage of conflict.

I want to reemphasize LTC Tkach's assessment:

""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region.

Those, as well as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and Ukrainians existence as Ukrainians, are the stakes!

Professor Snyder has posted a new explainer of Russian propaganda. From the Thread Reader App:

President Zelenskyy continues to shake up his senior national security team. From The Kyiv Independent:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's State Security Administration (UDO), Serhii Rud, according to a presidential decree published on May 9.

The UDO's main tasks include ensuring the security of the President of Ukraine and high-ranking officials of the state, as well as the protection of administrative buildings and objects of state authorities of Ukraine.

Rud's dismissal comes shortly after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have uncovered a network of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who were plotting to assassinate President Zelensky and other high-ranking officials in Ukraine. Two colonels of the UDO accused of leaking classified information to Russia were reportedly detained.

The FSB network aimed to find perpetrators among the military close to Zelensky's security, ""who could take the head of state hostage and then kill him.""

Just a few weeks before, SBU officials and Polish law enforcement worked to detain a Polish citizen who allegedly offered to Russia to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In late November, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

The Ukrainian president issued several presidential decrees this week mandating changes in senior leadership across Ukraine's government and military.

Dmytro Hereha was reappointed as the commander of Ukraine's Support Forces, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was formally dismissed from military service. Zaluzhnyi will now serve as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.K.

Russian sources are claiming the Mariupol strike was ATACMS:

A video of the drone attacking the plant in Russian Salavat, Bashkiria, appeared on Russian Telegram channels.

The person who is filming says the drone is very large.

It looks like the drone flew about 1,500 km before it reached its target and hit the oiloil catalytic cracking unit.

Gazprom neftekhim Salavat is one of the largest oil refining and petrochemical production complexes in Russia. It specializes in the production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other types of petroleum products.

/6. According to Russian media Baza:

""the drone hit the catalytic cracking unit at about one o'clock in the afternoon, local time. Afterwards, employees of the enterprise heard a bang and saw smoke in the area of the Southern entrance. The fire was small, so workers were not evacuated; the plant is operating normally.

According to the head of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Radiy Khabirov, emergency services and heads of law enforcement agencies are now working on the spot. Preliminary, no one was hurt.""

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses - and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermine its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday It will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

It has been a long week. Everyone is, I'm sure worn out. So far, Rosie seems to be tolerating her third chemo treatment much better than her first two. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, kind wishes, and prayers for her. Also, there was a misfire with the GoFundMe. Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know.

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

9 May 2024 - 20:41

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

â¡ï¸Germany to buy 3 HIMARS for Ukraine.

â¡ï¸Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin is strangling Ukraine's economy by knocking out much of its electricity generation and wearing down the civilian population by bombing cities. Kharkiv, which is already rationing electricity, is being hit by glide bombs almost daily. Yet the city of more than 1m people is keeping calm and carrying on. On a sunny afternoon last week, residents strolled through a park and attendants went on emptying rubbish bins, even as two glide bombs landed with huge explosions less than a kilometre away. Keeping the city functioning and clean is a way to stand up to destruction and chaos.

With around 50,000 fresh Russian troops gathering across the border some 40km away, Kharkiv's commanders know they may be a target in Russia's next push. One scenario would be to isolate the city by cutting the main road to Kyiv. Another would be to move some 10km closer, putting the city's eastern outskirts within artillery range and creating a buffer zone to protect Belgorod, a Russian city that is being hit by Ukrainian drones.

Konstantin Nemichev is the commander of the famous Kraken regiment, a special-forces outfit formed in the early days of the invasion in 2022 that defended Kharkiv. He expects the enemy to attack the province again in mid-May, but reckons they will fail to get near the city. Interviewed outside a ruined school building in the east of town, the site of an intense firefight in 2022 in which invading soldiers were wiped out, the commander says the defence is much stronger now. It has three lines of fortifications and a full brigade to stop the Russians. ""They can move a few kilometres into the province,"" he says, ""but I don't think they can get as far as 10km.""

The Ukrainian armed forces know they have no choice but to fight on. ""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region. But this sense of urgency and existential threat, he says, needs to penetrate into the whole of Ukrainian society. ""People need to know the truth,"" he says. And Ukraine needs unity as it enters a new stage of conflict.

I want to reemphasize LTC Tkach's assessment:

""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region.

Those, as well as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and Ukrainians existence as Ukrainians, are the stakes!

Professor Snyder has posted a new explainer of Russian propaganda. From the Thread Reader App:

President Zelenskyy continues to shake up his senior national security team. From The Kyiv Independent:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's State Security Administration (UDO), Serhii Rud, according to a presidential decree published on May 9.

The UDO's main tasks include ensuring the security of the President of Ukraine and high-ranking officials of the state, as well as the protection of administrative buildings and objects of state authorities of Ukraine.

Rud's dismissal comes shortly after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have uncovered a network of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who were plotting to assassinate President Zelensky and other high-ranking officials in Ukraine. Two colonels of the UDO accused of leaking classified information to Russia were reportedly detained.

The FSB network aimed to find perpetrators among the military close to Zelensky's security, ""who could take the head of state hostage and then kill him.""

Just a few weeks before, SBU officials and Polish law enforcement worked to detain a Polish citizen who allegedly offered to Russia to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In late November, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

The Ukrainian president issued several presidential decrees this week mandating changes in senior leadership across Ukraine's government and military.

Dmytro Hereha was reappointed as the commander of Ukraine's Support Forces, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was formally dismissed from military service. Zaluzhnyi will now serve as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.K.

Russian sources are claiming the Mariupol strike was ATACMS:

A video of the drone attacking the plant in Russian Salavat, Bashkiria, appeared on Russian Telegram channels.

The person who is filming says the drone is very large.

It looks like the drone flew about 1,500 km before it reached its target and hit the oiloil catalytic cracking unit.

Gazprom neftekhim Salavat is one of the largest oil refining and petrochemical production complexes in Russia. It specializes in the production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other types of petroleum products.

/6. According to Russian media Baza:

""the drone hit the catalytic cracking unit at about one o'clock in the afternoon, local time. Afterwards, employees of the enterprise heard a bang and saw smoke in the area of the Southern entrance. The fire was small, so workers were not evacuated; the plant is operating normally.

According to the head of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Radiy Khabirov, emergency services and heads of law enforcement agencies are now working on the spot. Preliminary, no one was hurt.""

The U.S. could then export significant gas supplies because the U.S. produces 13.3 million barrels a day of crude oil, and 17 million barrels a day of crude oil and condensates, the highest ever, a result in large part due to the new technology of fracking.

The benefits of ""drill, baby, drill"" are clear. The U.S. in 2023 annually produced 180 million more barrels of oil than the previous 2019 peak. However, with growth in population of 15 million people, and GDP growth of $5.1 trillion, and oil supplies up only 3.6%, oil prices still shot up.

Despite increased U.S. production, sanctions on Russian did initially take oil off the market. But the other reason why oil prices have also shot up by 50% despite increased U.S. supply is that since 2021 there have been 200 executive actions taken by the U.S. government to preclude further enhanced coal, oil and gas production, largely as part of a policy of getting to zero net greenhouse gases by 2035.

And this occurred even though the U.S. already cut back significantly on green-house gas emissions. For example, gas production in the Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico has surged 345% while methane emissions have been already cut 76%. Fully meeting methane emission goals in the area would fulfill the reductions needed to meet the overall requirement for keeping global temperatures low, including for example, Exxon's plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.

The pursuit of lower fossil fuel production in the U.S. impedes Ukraine's war effort. Since 2021, West Texas U.S. crude oil prices climbed from $60/b to $83/b to where they are today. Pump prices also surged to over $3.50 a gallon on average, nearly a 50% increase compared to 2019.

This, in turn, was a key part of the nearly 20% increase in the cost of essentials since 2021, which also led to the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, to where an average mortgage now requires a 7% loan rate rather than 3% in 2021.

Why would the U.S. government not seek to keep oil and gas production high and inflation low, particularly with a national election coming up where inflation and the cost of living are high on the concern of many Americans? With lower energy prices, Americans might be more willing to help Ukraine even as the country seeks a sound energy policy consistent with both environmental standards and robust economic growth.

However, even more importantly, a sound U.S. energy strategy could help the U.S. win the war against Russia and simultaneously place Ukraine at the center of a new invigorated energy policy (1) transforming Ukraine into an independent energy gas station for all of Europe and (2) eliminating the leverage Mocow seeks in enhancing Europe's dependence on energy supplies from Russia, most notably natural gas to Germany.

The strategic situation is Europe involves more than Ukraine. Much evidence has recently appeared confirming that beyond its aggression against Ukraine Russia is waging war against Europe as a whole. Apart from military operations in Ukraine, many NATO members now warn about Russian military attacks against other European states within 3-5 years. On top of Russian military attacks massive Russian information and espionage operations against Europe are occurring regularly.

However, the bedrock instrument of Russian policy for the last generation has been its energy penetration of Europe that provides the financial basis for its other operations and in many cases leads directly into the political-economic subversion of governments from Germany, Italy, and Austria through the Balkans into Belarus and Ukraine.

One major example of the process whereby dependence upon Russian energy translates into Russian political warfare is Moldova. Lacking its own indigenous energy sources and having already been victimized in 1992 by Moscow's seizure of its province Transnistria (the land beyond the Dniester River), Moldova has been the target of repeated Russian efforts to destroy its sovereignty and integrity for over 30 years.

Indeed, in 2023 Russia apparently planned a coup there just as it tried to attack it in 2014 during the seizure of Crimea. In all of Moscow's pressure against Moldova it has taken that state's energy dependence upon Russia as the point of departure for all of its probes and as a basis for financing these operations.

Balkan coups led by Russian agents either in Russia or in countries like Transnistria are a regular tactic of the Russian government. Russia instigated coups in Macedonia, Montenegro in 2015-16 and evidently attempted to stage another coup in Bulgaria in 2016 using the extensive influence it has gained there. Outgoing Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov has just commented that we should ""expect Russia to do 'whatever possible'"" to preserve its influence here.

Here too Russian leverage begins with energy. In Bulgaria, leaked documents have repeatedly confirmed Russia's concealed control over the Turk Stream pipeline bringing Russian gas from TÃ¼rkiye to Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary. As the Center for the Study of Democracy in Bulgaria reported in 2020, also on the basis of leaked corporate documents, since 2019, before construction of this pipeline began, Russia was using Saudi, Belarussian and European companies to evade U.S. sanctions against the Turk Stream pipeline. Consequently, Russia ships the gas, builds the pipeline, and finances it through proxy entities.

The proper response to this war on Europe must go beyond the resolute, regular, consistent, and decisive provision of the weaponry Ukraine needs to win, i.e., restore its integrity and realize its full sovereignty. Whether Ukraine can achieve these objectives has come under serious question recently, but however the outcome the U.S. and its allies' strategy must also comprise a permanent reduction of European energy dependence upon Russia, an objective fully within the U.S. capability.

Both these replies to Moscow are not only feasible but also must necessarily form parts of a coherent strategy, something to which the Biden Administration seems to be allergic or at least unable to put forward. For example, Moldova's ability to ward off Russian pressures begins with ridding itself of Russian energy leverage. To the degree that it has currently done so it has utilized foreign energy sources and EU subsidies. This is clearly inadequate for the long term. But there are viable alternatives that can be brought into play for Moldova and for much if not all of the Balkans.

The pipelines bringing Russian gas to Moldova traverse Ukraine in conformity with long-standing agreements between Moscow and Kyiv. However, since Europe is scheduled to eliminate all Russian gas by 2027, including LNG, and stocks for 2025 are already abundant, Ukraine now feels it can safely terminate its contract with Gazprom to bring oil to the Balkans and Eastern Europe through pipelines located in Ukraine. Ukraine, despite the war, has been on and off exporting electricity to states like Romania since the war began and the advent of peace could certainly see a regeneration of those exports. Moreover, should its energy capabilities be restored it can then utilize the existing pipeline infrastructure to export considerable amounts of hydrocarbons or other energy sources to the Balkans. Such visions may seem far-fetched or even utopian when Russia is now pulverizing whatever it can of Ukraine's energy sector, in the context of Ukraine's necessary strikes on Russian oil refineries.

Nevertheless, those strikes also reflect Russia's growing alarm that its own energy sector is being targeted and at risk of being excluded from its natural historical market, Europe. Indeed, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov now complains that the West wants to defeat Russia to oust it from energy markets, showing Russia's concerns about being supplanted by a revived Ukraine.

These factors duly suggest the requisite course of action to negate Russia's aerial power and offensive while also strengthening Moldova and other Balkan countries and reducing Russia's energy presence in the Balkans. In the military domain transferring the air defense capabilities to Ukraine that enable it to negate Russian attacks on its energy and electrical infrastructure and armed forces will not only diminish the likelihood of a successful Russian ground and air offensive but also rehabilitate that infrastructure and spur energy production.

Providing these capabilities would also enhance Kyiv's threat to Crimea and the Russian energy facilities that Russia illegally seized there in 2014. Ukraine can also use the respite provided by these weapons to begin delivering energy to Moldova or Romania and throughout the Balkans. By transferring weapons to Ukraine that it desperately needs (now that the assistance package has passed the House of Representatives), Ukraine can relatively quickly address its requirements and those of the Balkans to enhance stability and security while also defeating Russia's political warfare in the Balkans.

While these moves are being made and before their impact makes itself felt in Ukraine and the Balkans; we need to continue to ensure the ongoing supply of energy to states like Moldova, using American energy. U.S. gas supplies are the biggest in the world, and continued exports of LNG remain a critical ingredient to help reformulate U.S. security policy, which should start with a reversal of the administration's ban on new permit for LNG exports.

At the same time we should be employing all the means of power at our disposal to create a new energy order for Europe to promote the long-term diversification of energy suppliers to Europe and the concurrent revival of energy infrastructure and connectivity promised by programs like the Three Seas Initiative. This program is ideally suited to undertake the long-term economic and energy integration of all of Eastern Europe, including the Balkans and Ukraine among others, by fostering new means of connectivity and new infrastructure, prominently including energy pipelines from the Baltic to the Black Sea. But it requires strong diplomatic and economic support to move forward. Otherwise, it will fail to realize its potential and we will lose a strong instrument that can help build a stabler, more secure, and enduring European order.

China and India are growing greenhouse gas emissions (1.3 b/tons) from 2020-2 that exceed by 120% what the U.S. eliminated between 20007-2022 (1 b/tons) by a factor of 130%. And in Europe, with gas and coal declining markedly after an initial increase at the time of the Ukraine war, and despite a 19% record drop in GHG emissions, failure to have sufficient substitutes for Russian natural gas has seen wood and biomass burning increase in Europe where it is now 60% of ""renewables."" On the other hand, U.S. energy production especially oil and natural gas, can make the U.S. the swing world producer and markedly reduce the leverage of both OPEC and Russia.

Certainly, if such an initiative recovers its momentum, it will provide a basis for expanding Ukraine's energy ties, including Ukrainian energy exports of fossil fuels, electricity, nuclear power, and green energy to all of its neighbors, including Moldova. In that event we will have taken a major step, utilizing our military assistance, energy capabilities, and diplomatic strategy towards providing and executing a well-conceived and truly strategic conception to strengthen Ukraine, undermine Russian economic and military capabilities, and intensify European integration.

All three of those outcomes contribute materially to the long-standing American interest in what President George H.W. Bush memorably called a Europe whole and free.

Moreover, all these actions are now easily within our reach. What is needed is decisive strategic leadership to act according to this strategic plan. Russia's aggression against Ukraine represents not only a crisis but a once in a generation opportunity to advance vital American interests for which we fought three wars (including the Cold War), and we can do so with peaceful means. For too long we have acted without a strategy for victory, and if we continue to squander this opportunity neither history nor future generations will forgive us.

Now the other part of the story is that our ally Ukraine wants to curtail Russian, not U.S., oil, and gas production to impede Russia's war machine. But some within the Administration are pushing Ukraine not to attack Russian refineries. Apparently, the administration believes if Russian oil and gas supply are harmed, energy prices would rise even higher to say nothing of whether such attacks on Russian soil would trigger Putin's often threatened escalation to the use of nuclear weapons.

Ironically, despite sanctions, Russia surprisingly produces 10.7mb/d of crude today, very close to the production in 2022 of 11.3mb/d. With prices 50% higher, however, Russian revenue is $7 billion a month higher or annually $84 billion higher than in 2021. This enables Moscow to better fund the war against Ukraine.

Therefore, if the U.S. wants to defeat the Russians and secure a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine territory, a key strategy (as President Reagan implemented) must certainly include curtailing Russian energy production, as nearly two-thirds of revenue to the Russian government comes from oil and gas sales.

Russian oil production at the time of the 2022 invasion was 11.3 million barrels a day while the EIA projects Russian production for all of 2024 will remain at 10.7 million barrels a day, the third largest in the world. Energy sanctions apparently have not done enough to deter Russia because they do not yet appear to be effective. This is also because Russia has reoriented its sales to China, Turkye and India, while evading sanctions by using unregistered and uninsured tankers for transport, dropping exports to Europe from 20 million cubic meters per month to 4 million.

Sanctions were designed to punish Russia and keep its energy revenue down, but pushing Ukraine not to attack Russian oil refineries moves in the opposite direction, keeping Russian oil and gas production and supply as well as revenues high. At the same time, the U.S. Administration is also spending hundreds of billions to keep U.S. reliable fossil fuel production down but more unreliable renewable energy production up.

One of President Reagan's key measures was to dramatically increase U.S. (and Saudi) oil production to significantly lower the prices of oil and gas and literally take away multiple tens of billions of dollars from the Soviet exchequer.

At the time, oil and gas exports were the most important source of foreign exchange for the entire Soviet government, along with arms sales. Lowering oil prices from today's $83-7/barrel to even $60 would substantially cut Moscow's revenue.

The U.S. has the resources to increase the world-wide oil and gas supply significantly, even if Russian domestic energy production were curtailed by Ukraine attacks. Thus, both U.S. energy policy and U.S. Ukraine war strategy illustrate how an all of government approach requires the left and right hand to work in sync rather in contradiction to each other.

However, one views global climate change and the role of fossil fuel production, you cannot reduce access to U.S. energy sources from where currently 60% of all electricity comes and expect prices not to stimulate inflation and then interest rates with a deleterious impact on the U.S. economy. This, in turn, makes it more difficult for Congress to appropriate billions to support Ukraine's defense. On top of which, natural gas can substitute for call and improve the environment simultaneously.

As Robert Zubrin wrote many years ago, from 1974 through 2008, every major spike in U.S. oil prices has been followed by a recession in the United States. For the U.S. with a $34 trillion debt now that is accumulating at $1 trillion every 90-100 days, bringing inflation down and interest rates as well is important. The U.S. in 2023 paid more in interest payments on the debt than we spent for the entire U.S. Department of Defense. To prevent further economic erosion, the U.S. must increase its own oil and gas production if simultaneously the U.S. wants to curtail Russian production as a deterrent strategy against Russia.

However, when the United States pushes against Ukraine attacks against Russian energy facilities, a key part of Ukraine toolbox is taken away, allowing Russian domestic production, and refining as well as exports of oil and gas to continue. Although not exporting as much to Europe compared to 2022, Russia exports more oil and gas now to India, China, and TÃ¼rkiye, all of whom have pushed aside sanctions against purchasing Russian energy, while the previous assumptions of declining tanker availability have also not been borne out.

One recent report concludes ""Russia, along with other countries not participating in sanctions, have established shipping services designed to avoid G7 sanctions and price caps, leading to more export outlets being available to Russia.... we expect Russia's production to average 10.7 million b/d in 2023 and remain mostly unchanged in 2024.""

Whatever the U.S. thought sanctions would do to help the war to stop Russian aggression, our energy policy has left Russian oil and gas production only marginally reduced (1.3mb/d vs. 10.7 mb/d) and generated U.S. inflation at over 20% since 2021. This is not a sound policy and needs to be overhauled.

Whatever the U.S. thought sanctions would do to help the war to stop Russian aggression, our energy policy has left Russian oil and gas production only marginally reduced (1.3mb/d vs. 10.7 mb/d) and generated U.S. inflation at over 20% since 2021. This is not a sound policy and needs to be overhauled.

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses - and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermine its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday It will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

It has been a long week. Everyone is, I'm sure worn out. So far, Rosie seems to be tolerating her third chemo treatment much better than her first two. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, kind wishes, and prayers for her. Also, there was a misfire with the GoFundMe. Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know. But I do want anyone who did donate and who is getting a refund to know that I appreciate what you did very, very, very much!

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

9 May 2024 - 20:41

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

â¡ï¸Germany to buy 3 HIMARS for Ukraine.

â¡ï¸Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin is strangling Ukraine's economy by knocking out much of its electricity generation and wearing down the civilian population by bombing cities. Kharkiv, which is already rationing electricity, is being hit by glide bombs almost daily. Yet the city of more than 1m people is keeping calm and carrying on. On a sunny afternoon last week, residents strolled through a park and attendants went on emptying rubbish bins, even as two glide bombs landed with huge explosions less than a kilometre away. Keeping the city functioning and clean is a way to stand up to destruction and chaos.

With around 50,000 fresh Russian troops gathering across the border some 40km away, Kharkiv's commanders know they may be a target in Russia's next push. One scenario would be to isolate the city by cutting the main road to Kyiv. Another would be to move some 10km closer, putting the city's eastern outskirts within artillery range and creating a buffer zone to protect Belgorod, a Russian city that is being hit by Ukrainian drones.

Konstantin Nemichev is the commander of the famous Kraken regiment, a special-forces outfit formed in the early days of the invasion in 2022 that defended Kharkiv. He expects the enemy to attack the province again in mid-May, but reckons they will fail to get near the city. Interviewed outside a ruined school building in the east of town, the site of an intense firefight in 2022 in which invading soldiers were wiped out, the commander says the defence is much stronger now. It has three lines of fortifications and a full brigade to stop the Russians. ""They can move a few kilometres into the province,"" he says, ""but I don't think they can get as far as 10km.""

The Ukrainian armed forces know they have no choice but to fight on. ""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region. But this sense of urgency and existential threat, he says, needs to penetrate into the whole of Ukrainian society. ""People need to know the truth,"" he says. And Ukraine needs unity as it enters a new stage of conflict.

I want to reemphasize LTC Tkach's assessment:

""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region.

Those, as well as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and Ukrainians existence as Ukrainians, are the stakes!

Professor Snyder has posted a new explainer of Russian propaganda. From the Thread Reader App:

President Zelenskyy continues to shake up his senior national security team. From The Kyiv Independent:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's State Security Administration (UDO), Serhii Rud, according to a presidential decree published on May 9.

The UDO's main tasks include ensuring the security of the President of Ukraine and high-ranking officials of the state, as well as the protection of administrative buildings and objects of state authorities of Ukraine.

Rud's dismissal comes shortly after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have uncovered a network of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who were plotting to assassinate President Zelensky and other high-ranking officials in Ukraine. Two colonels of the UDO accused of leaking classified information to Russia were reportedly detained.

The FSB network aimed to find perpetrators among the military close to Zelensky's security, ""who could take the head of state hostage and then kill him.""

Just a few weeks before, SBU officials and Polish law enforcement worked to detain a Polish citizen who allegedly offered to Russia to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In late November, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

The Ukrainian president issued several presidential decrees this week mandating changes in senior leadership across Ukraine's government and military.

Dmytro Hereha was reappointed as the commander of Ukraine's Support Forces, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was formally dismissed from military service. Zaluzhnyi will now serve as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.K.

Russian sources are claiming the Mariupol strike was ATACMS:

A video of the drone attacking the plant in Russian Salavat, Bashkiria, appeared on Russian Telegram channels.

The person who is filming says the drone is very large.

It looks like the drone flew about 1,500 km before it reached its target and hit the oiloil catalytic cracking unit.

Gazprom neftekhim Salavat is one of the largest oil refining and petrochemical production complexes in Russia. It specializes in the production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other types of petroleum products.

""the drone hit the catalytic cracking unit at about one o'clock in the afternoon, local time. Afterwards, employees of the enterprise heard a bang and saw smoke in the area of the Southern entrance. The fire was small, so workers were not evacuated; the plant is operating normally.

According to the head of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Radiy Khabirov, emergency services and heads of law enforcement agencies are now working on the spot. Preliminary, no one was hurt.""

It has been a long week. Everyone is, I'm sure worn out. So far, Rosie seems to be tolerating her third chemo treatment much better than her first two. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, kind wishes, and prayers for her. Also, there was a misfire with the GoFundMe. Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know. But I do want anyone who did donate and who is getting a refund to know that I appreciate what you did very, very, very much!

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

9 May 2024 - 20:41

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

Glory to Ukraine!

Two Ukrainian hydroelectric power plants will not be functioning due to damage caused by the Russian missile attack on May 8th - Ukrhydroenergo.

â¡ï¸Germany to buy 3 HIMARS for Ukraine.

Germany will buy three HIMARS multiple rocket launchers for Ukraine, the country's defense minister announced on May 9. Speaking during a trip to Washington, Boris Pistorius said they would be purchased from the U.S. and handed over to Kyiv.

â¡ï¸Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Audrey Gilbeau with Nokiiwin says these laptops will go a long way. >>Having equipment that's really functioning is one thing having the equipment that's going to be able to potentially help elevate someone's opportunities as they start to look to engage with them, not only education but employment as well >>In today's world with today's education requirements is virtually impossible for students to totally succeed going Through public school then post secondary education without having a laptop to be able to access resources do assignments >>And that's all the time we have for this edition of Northwest Newsweek, join us next time for more top stories from across the region. from across the region. from across the region. from across the region. from across the region. from across the region.

For the first time number months, hamas rockets rain down on israel as trucks carrying desperately desperately-needed aid finally enter gaza. >>> Scrambling for shelter. >> When it hit, it was just so loud. >> Jeff: powerful tornados tear through the central united states. >>> Mandatory military service. >> We will introduce a bold new model. >> Jeff: the british prime minister's controversial campaign promise. >>> Plus missing messi. [ Chanting ] >> Jeff: canadian soccer fans raise their voices after a superstar snub. >> Announcer: ""global national"" with farah nasser. Reporting tonight, jeff semple. >> Jeff: good evening, and thank you for joining us. For the first time in four months, air raid sirens sounded in tel aviv, sending israelis scrambling for cover. Israel says hamas launched at least eight long-range rockets. Israel says it underscores the threat hamas continues to pose after seven months of war. This 84-year-old and her caretaker barely escaped. She described the chaos when the rocket landed on her house. Israel says the rockets were fired from rafah in southern gaza. The israeli military is preparing to launch a major offensive on that city, despite pleas from its allies and the u.n.'s top court. And a warning, the images you're about to see here are disturbing. This was the aftermath of an israeli strike on rafah today. At least 30 people were killed according to the hamas-run health ministry. The palestinian red crescent society says it happened in an area designated for displaced civilians. Israel claims it was targeting a compound housing hamas militants and that it had successfully eliminated two major hamas laders. David aiken has our top story tonight. >> Reporter: for the first time in four months, air raid sirens sounded in tel aviv. Residents scrambled for cover. This video, released by hamas, shows the missiles leaving gaza. And the israeli army says they were launched from rafah from a site less than a kilometer where israeli forces were stationed. >> Hamas launched this rocket from near two mosques in rafah. Hamas has been attacking israel from rafah. >> Reporter: one person in israel was injured, and damage otherwise was minor. Still, it was a demonstration that even after seven months of fighting, hamas still has significant weapons. Meanwhile, israel allowed around 200 aid trucks through the kerem shalom crossing at gaza's southeastern corner, bypassing the main rafah crossing that has been closed for weeks. But some of the food has been waiting so long to cross, it is beginning to rot. And on the diplomatic front, norway's foreign minister sunday presented palestinian prime minister with papers confirming norway's recognition of the state of palestine. They used the unit to repeat calls for an end to the war >> I think it's time to go beyond condemning actions and requesting israel to stop the war in gaza. I think we need to raise the voices a little bit more and demand a ceasefire. >> Reporter: but the rocket attack makes a ceasefire much less likely. One hardline minister in netanyahu's cabinet urged the army to hit rafah even harder. David aiken, global news, ottawa. >> Jeff: israel also struck several targets inside southern lebanon today, killing at least eight people. Israel says the strikes were in response to an earlier attack by hezbollah that saw 15 rockets launched into israel.

>>> And the war in gaza continues to spark protests here in canada, and a deadline is fast approaching for protesters at canada's largest university. Members of a pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto are meeting with the administration, which has given them until tomorrow morning to clear out. Protesters are presenting the university's leadership with a counter offer after rejecting the administration's proposal last week.

You don't know when to turn the seat belt sign on. If you leave it on all the time, people are going to ignore it. They'll get up and walk anyway to use the restroom. You can expect the seat belt sign won't be on more than likely when you encounter this unexpected turbulence. >> Linda: if you can't see it coming, clear turbulence as a pilot, what can you do beyond quickly turning that seat belt light on? >> Well, by then it's too late. We have speeds called turbulence penetration speeds. If we had anticipated the turbulence, we could have slowed the airplane to that particular speed. Because there's no warning, we can't do anything. Once the turbulence occurs, turn on the seat belt sign on it's really too late. Folks don't have time to fasten their belts to get to their seats. >> Linda: we had a pretty similar incident even more severe earlier this week. A man dying of suspected heart attack, dozens injured in a flight to singapore. Given that these incidents happened just days apart and we heard of recent incidents that are similar as well. How do you think this is affecting the public's perception about flight safety? >> Well, you're going to incur a certain amount of turbulence as well as normal turbulence. If you fasten your seat belt, it's probably not going to bother you. It's the folks that didn't do that that got injured. It's easy to prevent injury. That's the main takeaway. Passengers have to be prepared at any time to anticipate some turbulence. >> Linda: that's aviation expert and former airline pilot keith mackey. For the first time in months, hamas has hit central israel with rocket attacks. Militant group says it launched a barrage of projectile from rafah in southern gaza. Journalist irris makler is in jerusalem and has the details. >> Reporter: what we know is that the barrage of something like eight rockets, crossed into israeli airspace. Most of them were intercepted. There was minor injuries, minor damage. Very few injuries to people. Nevertheless, most of that was injuries from shrapnel. Israelis in the centre of the country were running to the bomb shelters. Airport was closed. It did have an impact on israel. What hamas said it's interesting. It's been four months since the last barrage to central israel. Hamas claimed responsibility. Pretty smartly. They said they were doing it in retaliation to israel's massacre. What israel says is this. They are firing from rafah. That's also significant. They are firing from rafah as israeli troops advance. They know once those rockets and weapons are located, they will destroy them. They are using it before they can be destroyed. Nevertheless, they have given some ammunition to right wing politicians in israel who say how can you stop fighting in rafah when there's still sufficient weapons there to be fired into central israel? >> Linda: this latest escalation came after eight trucks came through israel to bypass the rafah crossing through egypt. What can you tell us about that? >> Reporter: hundreds of trucks were lined outside the rafah crossing since israel took that crossing on may 6th. It's not far, 5 kilometres down the road to an israeli border crossing. They are going in from there. Some 200 trucks ready to go in. Much of the food has already spoiled. We have heard from palestinian sources inside the gaza strip that eight trucks had gone in with fuel and cooking gas. That is significant. What's coming in from the other pier that the U.S. set up is a smaller amount of aid. It's more expensive to get in. It doesn't come in the same quantity. Everybody is advocating for aid to come in by land through the old system through these border crossings. However, the problem is distribution. What we're hearing from the owner of the U.N. refugee agency, once it gets in it's hard to get it out. Especially to the something like 900,000 palestinians estimated to be on the coast having fled rafah. How do you get them to the coastal area. There's nothing there but the

but the tents that they put up. There's no infrastructure. All of those issues, has to be said the fact that some aid is going in. >> Linda: that's irris makler in jerusalem. Representatives from dozens of countries are in brussels to talk about the future of the palestinian authority. The meeting comes just days before three european countries are set to recognise a palestinian state. >> The palestinian government calls on all states that have not yet recognised the state of palestine to take this principle decision as soon as possible. >> Linda: that was palestinian prime minster today thanking spain, norway and ireland for their decision to officially recognise the palestinian state later this week. He calls on the international community to pressure israel for a cease-fire. Today's meeting in brussels is a chance for countries to exchange views about the plans and priorities of the palestinian authority which currently controls the west bank. Several european countries say that the palestinian authority should take over the control of gaza from hamas. Meanwhile, at the university of toronto, organizers from a pro-palestinian encampment have released a counter proposal they plan to present to school officials later today. >> This process is slow. Bureaucratic and archaic. We reject playing a game that will go nowhere. Our counteroffer is built on the fact that the office of the president has the ability to create new processes and make decisions on divestments. >> Linda: they want the university of toronto to divest fully from israel and suspend any ties to the country. The counterproposal will be handed to school officials ought 5:00 P.M. eastern time. Protesters have been issued a trespass notice and told to leave by 8:00 tomorrow morning. U of t presented an a ever last week that the school says claims has investment in weapons manufacturing companies in israel has no bases in fact. Also in toronto, police are searching for multiple suspects who fired gunshots at a jewish girl elementary school. >> Suspects arrived at the school in a vehicle. Dark coloured vehicle. They exited the vehicle and opened fire at the school causing damage to the front of the school. The suspect then got back in the vehicle and left the area. There were no reported sound of gunshots at the time. There was no reported injuries. >> Linda: the force hate crime unit is helping with the investigation and police are increasing their presence in the local community. Prime minster justin trudeau and ontario premier doug ford have taken to social media to condemn the shooting and call it an act of anti-semitism. The prime minster will attend ceremonies marking the 80th verse of the d-day landing in france next month. It will be the first time justin trudeau has attended the event since the 75th anniversary in 2019. More than 14,000 canadian soldiers landed or parachuted into france on june 6, 1944. Suffering more than a thousand casualties that day including 359 killed. The battle of normandy saw 5000 canadian troops lose their lives. Thousands more wounded. We're back in just a moment.

The U.S. has responded to an appeal today by volodymyr zelensky. The ukrainian president called on U.S. joe biden and chinese leader xi jinping to take part in a peace summit in switzerland next month. The U.S. will take part but didn't say who or at what level. The summit is approaching as russian forces advance on the eastern front and continues to target the northeastern city of kharkiv. Bomb and missile strikes there saturday killed four people and wounded dozens of others. Ukraine is hoping the meeting in switzerland will help increase international pressure on russian president vladimir putin. U.S. presidential hopeful donald trump was heckled last night while campaigning at the the libertarian national convention. >> I think you should nominate me and vote for me. We should win together. >> Linda: trump's supporters and libertarians repeatedly clashed during the event. Resulting in several members of the audience being escorted out of the building. Trump is hoping to appeal libertarians ahead what is forecast to be a tight election this november. The campaign stop underscores the focus of trump's campaign on third party candidates. This week, british prime minster rishi sunak announced earlier an expected general alex. -- election. Scott lucasabilitys the election campaign will be all about the economy. >> The starting point is simply that britain is not in a better place under the tories who have led a coalition or been the sole party in power since 2010. The situation has gotten far worse through the combination of the covid pandemic and the u.k.'s self-inflicted wound of leaving the european union. G.D.P. is probably going to suffer in relative terms by 8% to 9% by 2030 because of that decision in the european union. Trade suffered. Investment has suffered. Inflation is down to 2.3% now. That fall is not as much as economist were expecting because of our year on year drop on energy prices. I think the prospect of U.K. economy is not good. Beyond that, the day-to-day public services that have been better off british society, a transport system that serves all people, housing, education. Those are at breaking point and because the government has a serious funding crisis in part, because of the damage trade, damage investment, damage to manufacturing with brexit. It doesn't have the money to repair those public services. >> Linda: scott lucas from the clinton institute at university college dublin. Stay with us. More news just ahead.

The fans that inspired that canadian classic is back. He was the co-writer on brian adams hit ""summer of 69"". It was inspired by his first band. Last night they reunited at their old stomping ground. The school in british columbia. It -- they played songs and relived some of the best kays kay -- days of their lives. We spoke to jim valance earlier and how they came up with ""summer of 69"" >> We kept in touch all these years. I met these guys when I was 13 in grade eight. My dad got moved every two years. We kept in touch after that. I see them once a decade may be, go back to school reunion or something. Last night was special. It was the first time we actually played together in more than 60 years. Brian and I started off, before I met him I was in a canadian band. Once I met brian in 1978, it was not overnight success.

It kind of becomes your normal. There's no pressure. It's hard work but really enjoyable. Sometimes I stop and think to myself, it's been a wonderful ride. I have to say. Brian and I sitting in the room and we started that song with a discussion about what do you want to write about today. We decided we would write about our first band or first guitars or first girlfriends. One line at a time the page starts to fill up with lyrics. We finished the song in a day or two. It was called ""best days of your life."" it stayed like that for a month.

we had a better title somewhere. Tucked away in the first verse was it was the summer of 69. We thought summer of 69. That's got a great ring to it. If you remember your english class, it's called alliteration, ""summer of 69"" we took that phrase and shoe horned it later in the song and changed the title of the song. >> Linda: jim valance speaking to us earlier from british columbia.

We begin another mid-air incident that left multiple people injured. It happened on a qatar airways plane flying from the middle east to dublin. Cbc's albert delitala is looking into what happened. >> Reporter: 12 people were injured when that qatar airways flight hit turbulence on its way to dublin. The airport does say that it landed safely and on time. But certainly, some scary moments.

let's show you on a map just where it happened. The airport confirms the qatar airways flight hit turbulence while flying over turkiye. The incident reportedly lasting less than 20 seconds according to passengers. It happened during the food and drink service on the plane. Six passengers and six crew reported injuries. You can see some of the scenes there after that plane safely landed meeting emergency crew when it did on the ground. Here's some passengers who spoke to irish public broadcaster R.T.E. after they got off the plane. >> We were all over the plane and everywhere. [ indiscernible ] >> Flight attendant went into the air. Food went everywhere. It was panic everywhere. >> Reporter: the airline calls the injuries minor and said that those who were injured are receiving medical attention. It didn't directly comment on the turbulence. It did say that an internal investigation is happening into that incident. >> Linda: sounds like a pretty harrowing incident according to the passengers on that flight. It also sounds like we're hearing about these things more frequently lately. This comes just days after a fatal incident on a singapore airlines flight. Tell us more about that. >> Reporter: that was on tuesday singapore airlines flight. That flight hit severe turbulence on its way to singapore from london. A 73-year-old british man died of suspected heart attack. You can see some of the scenes on that plane after all of that. 20 people sent to the I.C.U. the U.S. transportation safety board says turbulence is the most common kind of airplane incident. Most of those incidents result in one or more serious injuries. One airline say the analyst says turbulence is becoming more common with climate change. That airlines are adjusting their planes accordingly. >> Over the last 20 years, [ indiscernible ] multiscan, which is mentioned really good picture of what the weather is like ahead. They are making progress into turbulence detection as well. Also, airlines are now sharing data between aircraft encounters with turbulence everybody can be advised that's on that same flight track. >> Reporter: in terms of that singapore airline incident, the airlines says it is cooperating with investigators on the investigation there. That plane that returned to singapore today from bangkok where it made that emergency landing. Many of the passengers remain in bangkok where they are being treated. >> Linda: that was cbc's albert delitala. Keith mackey the former airline pilot and aviation expert. He spoke to us how to protect yourself. >> Reporter: apparently they were secking meals. Settlement of the injured were flight attendants. They were walking about the cabinets to get the meals out. Other six passengers injured, I would wager were not fastening their seat belts. If this occurs and it can happen very suddenly without any warning at all. If you're not strapped in there's a good chance you'll get brain and upper spinal injuries. While you're seated, keep that belt fastened. Not loosely fastened but keep it firmly fastened. If you're in a car wreck, you wouldn't want to have a loosely fastened seat belt. >> Linda: the turbulence that they hit, are there any clues that you can glean from what we're hearing about the flight about what this airplane encountered? >> Well, here's the situation. If you have no turbulence, if flying through area of thunderstorms. You know the storms are there. You warn the people what to expect. Usually if it's some turbulence associated with it. It's not for naught turning the seat belt sign on. When you get through, you can turn the sign off. You don't know when to turn the seat belt sign on. If you leave it on all the time,

The move by ireland, norway, and spain seen as dim bollic. But it sends another message to israel -- symbolic. The israeli foreign minister responded saying the message is that terrorism pays. It may also put pressure on canada which abstained from an earlier U.N. vote to allow a state of palestine to join the united nations. Ctv's annie bergeron-oliver tonight with an update on the diplomacy and the conflict. >>> Humanitarian aid groups in gaza are issuing a dire warning. Supplies and personnel are running so low the U.N. agency for palestinian refugees has suspended food aid operations in rafah. >> The situation is absolutely catastrophic. Children who are at the very brink of famine are now closer than they've probably ever been so this catastrophic situation. >> Reporter: the worsening humanitarian crisis in gaza comes more than seven months since the war began after hamas attacked israel taking more than 200 hostages. Today a heart breaking new video shows the moments after five young women were taken hostage. This woman's 19-year-old daughter daniela is one of them. >> It's not a very easy thing to see -- to see your daughter and this terrified look. >> Reporter: the ongoing conflict and the devastation it's caused has prompted spain, norway, and ireland to recognize a palestinian state. >> Our decision to recognize palestine should not have to wait indefinitely. Especially when it is the right thing to do. >> Reporter: already, though, the decision has sparked swift condemnation from israel which has ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those three countries. >> Israel claims that this is a reward to hamas. And I suggest that it is not a reward to hamas who has no interest in two states, has no interest in the continuation of israel's existence. It's a reward to moderates in the palestinian authority. >> Reporter: the move comes after 143 countries voted in support of palestinian membership at the united nations, something only states are granted. Canada abstained from that vote. >> [ Shouting ] >> Reporter: canada has maintained its support for a two-state solution where the palestinian state is only recognized as part of a long-term political solution. >> Canada's long-standing position has been to support, to call for a two-state solution. That's the pass TOst laking peace in the middle east -- pass to lasting peace. >> Reporter: the recognition by the three european countries is historic, but largely symbolic. Their formal declarations, merella, will happen next tuesday. >> Merella: ctv's annie bergeron-oliver in ottawa.

>>> So in the past four days there have been five homicides in montreal. Just last night, three people killed in a brawl and one of them was only 15 years old. Ctv's genevieve beauchemin joins us now. Gen, are these incidents connected at all? What more are police saying about the violence? >> Reporter: yes, merella, and what's so startling to police is so many of these murders are unrelated to gang violence, including the one is that happened right here, the triple murder that unfolded in front of so many people in their apartments -- one that happened. >> Reporter: on tuesday night, around 15 people were involved in a violent brawl in the alley. When it was over, three people had been stabbed to death, including a 15-year-old boy. A classmate said the school principal broke the news to students. >> [ Speaking French ] >> Reporter: ""he told us he'd been killed in a fight,"" she says. ""many of us burst into stares."" police suspect a -- tears -- a personal conflict escalated into devastating violence. >> [ Speaking French ] >> Reporter: the father of one of the victims says he can't understand how this could have led to three families losing a son. In the past 10 days, montreal police have responded to seven homicides. One victim was killed with a firearm, five of the others stabbed. >> It's very difficult to say something about the knife. That's more teenager or person. The organized crime take more firearms. That's where we are. >> Reporter: montreal has a low murder rate compared to other big cities throughout canada and north america. For instance, in 2022, montreal had fewer murders per 100,000 inhabitants than winnipeg, vancouver, halifax, and toronto. And past spikes of violence here were most often related to turf wars over the control of the drug trade. Since last year, montreal police have cracked down on gun crimes, but several of the recent murders seem to be based on personal conflict including a fight between neighbours over music and last night's ball. Now, police are trying to pinpoint exactly what happened. They have a lot of surveillance videos, good quality ones to go through to determine exactly who was here at the time. Merella. >> Merella: ctv's genevieve beauchemin.

>>> So interpol investigators say hundreds of vehicles stolen from canadians are being found around the world. The international police agency says more than 1500 vehicles have been discovered since february and that's when rcmp began sharing data with the agency. Interpol collects information from 137 countries and now ranks canada among the 10 ward places in the would recall for car theft. 10 worst -- they say they are often shipped to africa and the middle east. >> Reporter: we are hearing from the passengers on board the singapore flight that hit some terrible turbulence. One person was killed in the incident. The travellers describe a scene of sheer terror in the cabin when the plane took a sudden dive. >> People flung across the aisle just like -- like, going completely horizontal hitting the ceiling and landing back down in, like, really awkward positions. People, like, getting massive gashes in their head. >> Merella: the london to singapore flight was carrying more than 200 passengers including two canadians. It was diverted to a bangkok airport. >>> London drugs confirmed cyber criminals are after a ransom after hacking into their system. They're demanding $25 million, which the company says it can't pay. Ctv's bc bureau chief andrew johnson is on the story. Andrew, the company says it can't pay, so how is it going to deal with this? >> Reporter: well, merella, the company is bracing for whatever was accessed to be released and offering to help employees protect themselves. As shoppers come and go from the department stores today, all is not well behind the scenes. London drugs is confirming a scenario it calls deeply distressing. The company is being held ransom by what it calls a sophisticated group of global cyber criminals. The retailer says in a statement, ""we acknowledge these criminals may leak stolen london drugs corporate files, some of which may contain employee information on the dark web."" experts are identifying the criminal group as lock bit. >> This retailer in canada, which is not the biggest organization in the planet, was up against one of the most sophisticated criminal gangs ever basing out of russia. >> Reporter: in a post, lock bit says it will release data stolen from london drugs in 48 hours. If the company does not pay $25 million. The leaked data is not believed to include patient or customer information. >> They have posted stuff before. They have also lied through their teeth about what day at that they have. They're criminals. You cannot trust them. They've tried to bluff their way through like some evil bond villain in a poker gang. >> Reporter: the original attack forced london drugs to close all 79 stores for about 10 days, among the longest retail outages due to a sighter attack in canadian history. Lock bit is believed to have extorted more than $100 million from thousands of victims including hospitals, schools, and global companies. London drugs is offering employees two years of identity theft protection in the case this is no bluff. Merella. >> Merella: all right. Ctv's andrew johnson.

All right here. Subscribe now atCRAVE.CA. >> This is certainly a surprise to us, but just at depths of need right across the country that unfortunately is not being met with a sense of urgency. Canada has reached a critical turning point as more people are struggling with poverty and food insecurity. >> That was on for too many events. That was not too many things and the person were there. >> 3 young males, including a 15 year-old boy are dead after being stabbed in a fight in montreal. He says at the start and important state. I'm from dallas tonight. Ireland, norway and spain plan to formally recognize a palestinian state move, angering israel. But a welcome by hamas. You're watching ctv news channel. I'm roger petersen. Thank you very much for joining us. >> Well, some sobering numbers when it comes to food insecurity in canada, in its annual poverty report. Cards. Food banks. Canada warns that we have reached a critical point as poverty and food insecurity worsened in every corner of the country. Canada received an overall grade of d minus. That's a drop from the d last year, only to provinces nova scotia and prince edward island managed to improve the rest of the country remain stagnant or worsened. >> Putting together housing plan, looking at yours, social assistance or benefits rates, making sure their indexed to inflation so that people are falling further and further behind into poverty. And then what we're suggesting for provinces that don't and put together a coordinated poverty reduction plan with with target so that you can hold your government to account and citizens can see that your government is taking action. Digging deeper into the numbers. The report found that more than 44% of people are feeling worse off when compared to last year. >> The percentage of people paying more than 30% of their income on housing hit 43.6% in 2024. Joining us now to discuss this further is neil hetherington, the ceo of the daily bread food bank. Neil, thank you for joining us. Unfortunately, you have to join us. >> Unfortunately, this is yet another it's an academic report that showing very clearly what we're feeling on the ground every single day here at the daily bread food bank here in toronto. >> How do we bring about change? I mean, we hear these reports after report after report. What do we do? >> Well, I think that's the frustrating part to us here at the food bank is we know the policy we know what is going on in the city and in the country. A it is a failing mark canadians overall are feeling financially worse off about 50% are financially worse off the year prior than they are this year. And we we know the policy alternatives, we know that it's, there is a lack of affordable housing income supports are not keeping pace and precarious employment is on the rise. >> Now we were seeing from 2021. The usage is up 50% of food banks. Where's that coming from? Is it to people, some people who are already destitute, are they just getting used to be using the food bank's accepted as part of their life or is it are more and more people being driven into situations where they have to turn to you. >> You know, it's, it's new people every single unfortunately are welcoming about 12 to 13,000 torontonians who have never used a food bank before are coming to the food bank for the very first time on a monthly basis. We're growing at 3 to 5% here in city of toronto, each every single month. This past april, there were 311,000 client visits up from about 60,000 and pre-pandemic. So the numbers continue to escalate. And you asked, you know, importantly, who's coming to the food bank individuals more than 50% to have a employment. And yet they can't make ends meet largely because of inflation that has started to, to taper moose. I'm very, very pleased to see the numbers that came out last week or so showing that inflation is under 3%. On the right trajectory >> How are you keeping up in toronto with this, with this growing demand? Well, it's not we're keeping up because there's incredible volunteers. There's a wonderful network of

agencies were responding to the call. But I got to tell you, rodger, the there is a growing sense of concern and a growing sense of frustration we have for year after year said there are clear policy alternatives that need to be implemented. Policies like the canada disability where if we, you know, just invested in that type of a program. We have the possibility of lifting up about a million and half canadians out of into a situation where they might thriving community. We know the policy solutions, we just need to have the governments at all levels have the fortitude and courage be able to implement them. And how would that work? That policy changes like to see. >> Well, yeah, I mean, when it comes to the canada disability benefit, we were very hopeful that it would be fully funded, meaning that somebody who currently is on disability in ontario, they receive about $1300 federally. There is to be a better $1000 top up to that. So they could at least be at the poverty the I was pleased to see in the federal budget, the re emphasis on affordable housing. So making sure that we are back building affordable housing and making sure that their rent supplements in place. And then I think provincially there are a whole host of measures to to start to decrease precarious employment to many people come to the food bank have full-time working, but are unable to have that allow them to be able to thriving community. We talk about the government helping out what the private sector do. >> Well, I think the private sector in a more often than not looking to to making sure that they are paying living wages. So not just minimum wage, but living wages so that their employees can have a decent place to live in the community that they're, they're working. You're right, it's not just a full exercise, but they ultimately have a duty of care to make sure that everybody's right to housing and everybody's right to food is realized so that food banks like the daily bread, food bank and food banks, canada all across the country can start to see the lineups decrease rather than the trajectory that they're currently on. >> And I mean, I know you do what you focus on and which is one of the most expensive cities in the world. But this is also an issue in smaller towns and and smaller municipalities. >> Abs, absolutely. And they don't have the same supports that we might have in a in larger urban areas. I mean, you just have to look at what's on the screen right now, right across the country. We're seeing, you know, a lot of red, we're seeing, you know, seasoned ease across the country when it comes to investments in affordable housing, when it comes to making sure that people have that a decent incomes, making sure that we've got an economy that allows businesses to thrive so that they can pay those living wages. >> Ok neal, thank you very much for joining us today. Always appreciate it. Neil hetherington is the ceo of the daily bread food bank. We're also getting a better sense of how canadians feel about the state of grocery prices in canada. The majority believe costs at stores are still climbing. A new leger poll found 29% blame the ryman rising costs on grocery chains who they believe are attempting to increase their profit margins. Senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at dalhousie university. Sylvain charlebois says he's not surprised. >> People have less money to spend on too. And they feel they feel desperate. And so they're looking to blame something, someone and he's is seeing ad to the one component, the supply chain that most people understand is the grocery store. But food inflation is much more complicated than that. But I'm not surprised to see the anger. The collective anger from some people out there. >> The federal government has introduced a voluntary code of conduct for major grocers to trying to promote fairness and transparency in the industry. Canada's biggest grocer loblaw has signed on industry minister francois-philippe champagne says he is hopeful others will follow suit. >> Seeing that inflation is going down. Why we have in recent years with respect to loblaw signing on it's a step in the right we have been in touch with walmart and costco and I'm hopeful that he will sign and that's, you know, if you talk grocers of kind of one of the key step to stabilize prices in canada. So we're going to keep about what we're going to keep on working with that. But I'm hopeful that everyone in the >> And frustration over high grocery prices pumped prompted a boycott of loblaw own stores this month. Now organizers say the protest we'll go beyond may 1st. According to the organizers, people supporting the boycott want to keep the movement going a release as the boycotters find a focus on advocacy efforts in the months ahead. Emily johnson is one of the key organizers and says the boycott has been a uniting moment for community members.

>> Ideally, what we wanted to do was just raise awareness of the drastically increasing cost of groceries means, you know, the fact that we do have control and power as consumers we never imagined in a million years that we had today. You know, 80,000 members on our subreddit own and and that there are 20,000 members between should kochan are instagram, it's its and we're just incredibly surprised by the viral atf. It. >> Well, a lot has pushed back against criticism of the company, saying it's not responsible for higher food prices. The canadian grocery chain has been expanding its discount stores to accommodate for the higher prices. And a live look in london, 10 downing street where we're waiting to hear from british prime minister rishi sunak's. He will be delivering a statement outside that famous store there likely announcing a summer general election. We'll take you there live when the prime minister speaks. Norway, spain and ireland have announced their intention to formally recognize a palestinian state, a declaration that would take effect on tuesday spoken with a number of of the heaters and counterparts. >> I'm confident that for other countries will join us and taking this important step in the coming weeks. >> Leaders from the 3 countries say they hope the move brings new momentum toward a 2 state solution, adding it's not a decision against israel or in favour of hamas, but instead one in support of peace. Israel reacted angrily to the move, calling the decision distorted. >> Israel claims that this is a reward to hamas. And I suggested it is not a reward ice who has no interest in 2 states, has no interest in the continuation of israel's existence. It's, it's a reward to moderates in the palestinian authority who already cooperate with israel. >> Israel has now recalled its ambassadors to ireland, norway and spain and some of their envoys. Hamas, meantime, welcomed the news news and is calling on other nations to follow suit. Meanwhile, in rafah, food distribution has been suspended due to a lack of supplies and insecurity. That according to the united nations. Well, prime minister trudeau says he is sticking by house speaker greg fergus, despite another controversy. We have full confidence in rexburg fergus as a. >> As a speaker, that is a common says a, a independent minded leader. The was dealt with was addressed by the party and by the house leader. It was unfortunate mistake. >> The issue is an invitation to a quote, summer evening with greg fergus and also referenced reckless policies of the conservatives, both conservative and bloc mp's are calling on fergus to step down. Ctv news political commentator scott reid says he doesn't see the attacks on fergus stopping anytime soon. Greg fergus is never going to moment's peace as speaker, he will be under constant fire. The conservatives opposed him when he was a candidate for speaker. >> They have pounced on the stakes city is made and they've made it clear that even in instances like this, where the mistake wasn't really his, they're going to hold him to account. So I think you're going to see great for guests on the grill over and over and over again. >> Let's go back to london now, where british prime minister rishi sunak is making a statement. >> I stood behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building behind me. I told you that we faced a generation defining moment and that we as a society would not be judged by some government action. >> But by the small acts of kindness that we showed, one of us. You met that challenge. And then some and I have never been proud to be british. When I introduce the follows skate. I did so not because I saw rick country simply in need of desperate help, little bit. We want. But because ice or a country, his future hung in the balance. I could be bold interest in the 10's of millions of you at home, that you would rise to the moment or I could accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth, it was no choice at all. I have never and will never leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days. Ally and you do that because you've seen it. I was like did that. I will forever do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it's easy to forget the scale of what we've been through. We were hit by pandemic upended

normal life. Who would have thought that the government would have to tell us how many times a day we could leave odds. Then just as we were recovering from covid full return to europe. With putin's invasion of ukraine energy bill spiring. I came to office the bubble to restore economic stability economic stability is the bedrock of any future success. Whether that is rising wages and good jobs investment in our public services. All the defensive, the country. And because of all collective sacrifice and your homework. We have reached 2 major milestones in delivering that stability. Showing that when we work together, anything as possible. Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted. Outpacing germany, france and the united states. >> And this morning, it was confirmed that inflation is back to normal. This means that the pressure on price israelis and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and parties I set out on work. I recognize that it is not always been easy. Some of you with any just be starting to feel the benefit. And for some, it might still be hard. When you look at your bank balance. But this hold and economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The question now is how and who do you trust to time that foundation into a secure future for you, your family and our country. Is the moment for britain to choose its future. To decide whether we want to build on the progress we have made risk going back to square one with no plan and no certainty. And today I spoke with his majesty, the king to request the dissolution of parliament. The king has grown to this request. We will have a general election on the 4th of july. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold. Putin's russia is waging a brutal war in ukraine and will not stop there. If he succeeds. That war is also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the middle east. The forces of business to extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and a volatile society here at heart. China, it's looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a leading technology. And migration is being weaponized by a stall states threatened the integrity of our. These uncertain times cool for a clip. Lot bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has stopped. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children. I cannot and will not play. We have got everything right. No government. I'm proud of what we have achieved together. The bold actions we have taken. I'm confident about what we can do in the future. We've tackled inflation controlled at caldwell cuts taxes and increase the state pension by 900 pounds. We've reduced taxes on investment, can seize the opportunities of brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow the business. That record amounts of funding into our nhs and ensure it is now trading. The doctors in the U.S. says it needs in the decades to come. We've reformed education and our children. Now the best returns in the west. We parts always energy security and your family finances over environmental do in our approach. And that's their right. We fully funded an increase in defence spending to 2 and a half percent of gdp. We made a decision to invest more in local transport you actually use rather than endlessly plow more money into hs 2. We set out a comprehensive plan to reform our welfare system to make it fast for those who pay for it as well as those who need it. Immigration is finally coming down and we all stopping the boats with our one departments. We will ensure that the next generation gross out smoke-free. I hope that my work since I became prime minister. Shows that we have apply and all for pat to take bold action necessary for all countries to flourish. I stuck with that plan and always been honest with you about what is needed, even when that's been difficult. Because I'm guided by doing what is right for our country. Not what is easy. I can say the same thing for the labour party. Because I don't know what. And in truth. I don't think, you know, ina. And that's because they have to plan. There is no action. And as a result, the future can only be on site. And with that. On the 5th of july and the

customer on will be prime minister. He has shown time and time again that he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made to become lately that once he got the job. How can you know that he would do exactly the same thing if he were to become prime minister. If you don't have the conviction to stick to anything you say. If you don't have the courage to tell people what you want to do. And if you don't have a plan. How can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times. Over the next few weeks. I will fight for every vote I will on your trust. I will prove to you. Only a conservative government led by me. Will not put a hold and economic stability at risk. Can restore pride and confidence in our country. And with a clear plan and bold action will deliver a secure future for you. Your family and our united kingdom. >> And you've been watching british prime minister rishi sunak standing outside of 10 downing street to announce that there will be a general election on july 4th. Now the conservatives have been saying for some time, it was going to be too early back end of the year, that they would have this election said they're announcing it for july. The 4th. It is a and has it happened at a time when his party is trailing the labour party. They're way behind in the polls. According to that end, even cirnac is struggling with his within his party. He took over only a year and a half ago. We have more coming (Dramatic music) (Cheering) I've got good news. There is a murderer - Oh! - walking among us. [gasps] Fantastic! I'm sorry, what?

Turning out to toronto and police headquarters there and said some charges have been dropped against protesters in the alleged hate-motivated mischief crimes. Ctv's rahim ladhani has more. >> I didn't lose all employment

because of these allegations that were false and proven to be so after accusing and charging 11 people for participating in alleged hate-motivated mischief. Police have now dropped the charges against 4 individuals who say they were unfairly targeted for supporting palestine. You're laying trumped-up charges that allow police to bust into our homes. To drake us our reputation through the mud. >> And 2 brand us as a criminals and we have not been charged with any crimes on november 10, 2 officers were called to the yorkville area at bay and bloor. >> Posters were glued to the doors and windows of an indigo bookstore and red paint had been splattered. The 11 accused had all been charged with multiple offences, including mischief over $5,000. Allegations of of postering in paint don't even meet the standard set out by the court of appeal for mischief. >> There is an important case called jeffers that encourage people to read it discusses the importance of how how posters in our communities are used for free expression expression by people. In response, the crown attorney's office says >> This decision should not be seen as a criticism of the police determination that there were reasonable grounds for the arrests of these 4 individuals. However, the standard for proceeding with a prosecution is properly higher and more rigorous. The indigo bookstore has been the subject of boycott campaigns for years over its founders has stick foundation for loans. Soldiers advocates say calling out the company is a form of activism against a foundation which offers scholarships to people without family in israel, who nevertheless served in the israeli military as jews, we say calling out companies that support israeli war crimes is a legitimate form of protest targeting indigo is not antisemitic. >> Lawyers for the 7 people who are still being prosecuted are calling for all charges to be dropped.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Instead, the best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy.

Over the past three years, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have worked to articulate a ""worker-centered"" trade policy while arguing for a ""new Washington consensus"" in U.S. international economic policy that will foster global investment and cooperation on issues like climate and development. Tai, Sullivan, and other U.S. officials have succeeded in laying out a vision for American industrial policy, one that has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars of announced investment in U.S. computer chip manufacturing and clean energy technology. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also has popularized the concept of ""friendshoring"" -- the idea that U.S. allies and partners can benefit as multinational corporations diversify away from China. This term first appeared in a 2021 White House report on supply chains.

But when it comes to the brass tacks of trade -- trade deals, tariff lines, the paperwork that companies have to file at the border, and other mechanics -- U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has not articulated a coherent agenda. At times, the administration has tried to use the specter of China's economic threat to generate support for trade deals. One notable example is its signature Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which is intended to strengthen economic relations between the United States and countries across the Pacific. But geopolitical arguments for deals are failing to carry the day. Last November, deep congressional skepticism and electoral concerns spurred the administration to indefinitely postpone the IPEF trade pillar, and it is unclear whether it will complete the work even after the 2024 election.

When it comes to the brass tacks of trade -- trade deals, tariff lines, the paperwork that companies have to file at the border, and other mechanics -- U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has not articulated a coherent agenda.

Former president Donald Trump, in his current campaign to return to the White House, does have a clear vision for trade: he has announced plans to deploy tariffs and other protectionist measures to support favored U.S. industries. The architect of Trump's trade policy between 2017 and early 2021, former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, has argued that the United States should vigorously deploy tariffs and other trade restrictions both to protect U.S. industry and to force not only China, but a variety of European and Asian countries, to cease unfair trade practices. However, a number of experts have raised concerns about the economic impacts of these policies as well as the risks they would pose to U.S. geopolitical relationships.

Resetting America's trade agenda and developing a trade vision capable of drawing broad support across Washington is going to require the government to, as Steve Jobs would have said, ""think different."" Rather than treating trade deals as a geopolitical endeavor that the United States should suffer through to support America's allies and partners, or pursuing Trump's vision of simply reducing trade (the geopolitical argument), the United States should get back to a basic premise that has guided successful trade policy in the past -- that policymakers can develop and promote trade policies that advance American economic interests as well as American geopolitical interests.

Resetting America's trade agenda and developing a trade vision capable of drawing broad support across Washington is going to require the government to, as Steve Jobs would have said, ""think different.""

Given the nature of the economic challenges the United States currently faces, this approach will require policymakers to spend less time on the geopolitics and more time on the economics. That choice, in turn, will encourage a shift in the primary focus away from regional deals and toward narrower sectoral deals that address the problems of greatest concern to most Americans, such as climate, energy, and the looming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. To actually solve those problems, the United States should be open to using a new set of tools in creating trade deals, including those related to financial instruments, development, and national security. Today's biggest challenges cannot be solved simply with market access and regulatory cooperation. The next chapter in American trade policy will need to entail new types of sectoral deals between the United States and key allies and partners on a set of issues that include climate and energy, supply chains, and AI and the digital economy.

Rebooting America's trade agenda first requires understanding why the protrade consensus that prevailed from the 1990s to the mid-2010s -- the most recent era of significant U.S. trade dealmaking -- broke down.

Since the end of World War II, the United States has undertaken successful rounds of trade dealmaking during periods when trade deals had both a clear geopolitical and a clear economic logic. In the late 1940s, in the aftermath of the war, the deal that fit both U.S. geopolitical and economic interests was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Geopolitically, American policymakers saw the GATT as a tool to shore up Western alliances in the nascent days of the Cold War. From an economic perspective, trade negotiators designed the GATT to be an antidote to prevent a return to the ""beggar thy neighbor"" tariff policies of the 1930s, which postwar economists and policymakers saw as having exacerbated the Great Depression. The agreement required reductions in tariff rates and ensured that members accorded each other ""most favored nation"" trading status to put further downward pressure on tariffs over time. From a U.S. perspective, American officials also understood the GATT as a tool to help open markets to U.S. goods at a time when the United States was the world's largest net exporter and needed foreign markets to replace war-driven demand for U.S. industry. Reductions in foreign tariffs on U.S. goods provided a major direct benefit for American industry.

Since the end of World War II, the United States has undertaken successful rounds of trade dealmaking during periods when trade deals had both a clear geopolitical and a clear economic logic.

The United States pushed to expand the GATT several times during the Cold War. The so-called Kennedy Round of 1964-1967 resulted in additional tariff reductions and began to establish disciplines around dumping, the practice where a country sells a product internationally at a lower price than the product sells for in its home market. The Tokyo Round of the 1970s expanded participation in the GATT to more than one hundred countries, seeking to include much of the nonaligned developing world. It began to try to tackle nontariff barriers and ""voluntary export restraints,"" a type of measure where countries would agree to limit export quantities in exchange for avoiding tariffs. With the introduction of a Subsidies Code, the Tokyo Round also began to introduce the concept of rules around subsidies.

However, the modern trade orthodoxy that guided U.S. trade policy from the end of the Cold War through the mid-2010s crystallized in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The fall of the Berlin Wall ushered in America's unipolar moment, when America's geopolitical policymakers saw an opportunity to use trade and economic relations to anchor its former Soviet adversaries and emerging geopolitical competitors, notably China, in a U.S.-led international order. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, meanwhile, presided over a period of neoliberal economic consensus in Washington that Washington thought was an economic model appropriate for the world as well. Trade policy and trade deals (as well as other policy levers such as the International Monetary Fund) offered a tool to promote that U.S. economic model abroad. This intersection of geopolitics and economics ushered in a remarkably productive period of trade policymaking, with initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and free trade agreements (FTAs) with more than a dozen nations. Other related policies included the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which cut tariffs on imports from democratic countries in Africa in a bid to foster development and democratic progress on the continent.

The deals of this era had a clear geopolitical logic. NAFTA was designed to strengthen the North American political union and, in the eyes of both presidents Bush and Clinton, to provide an eventual pathway toward a more democratic and economically unified Western Hemisphere -- a vision that George H. W. Bush's son and later president George W. Bush, took further with the Central America-Dominican Republic FTA (CAFTA-DR) a decade after NAFTA entered into force. The WTO, and China's ultimate accession to it at the end of the decade, reflected the prevailing 1990s geopolitical view that a global trading arrangement would help draw countries like China toward the West. As Clinton said of China's accession in 1999, ""it represents the most significant opportunity that we have had to create positive change in China since the 1970s,"" noting that China was ""agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values: economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people."" Or, as George W. Bush said about U.S. legislation to enact the CAFTA-DR agreement, ""this bill is more than a trade bill. This bill is a commitment of freedom-loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the Western hemisphere.""

FTAs with Morocco (2004), Bahrain (2005), and Oman (2006), enacted in the years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, were intended to bolster American allies in the war against Islamic terrorism and with the aspiration that economic progress could reduce the terrorist threat. In a 2003 presidential speech, George W. Bush laid out his economic vision for the region, which proposed bilateral FTAs as stepping stones toward a Middle East Free Trade Area. As he remarked, ""across the globe, free markets and trade have helped defeat poverty, and taught men and women the habits of liberty.""

The economic logic behind these deals was as important as the geopolitics. From a macroeconomic perspective, the trade deals of this era reflected a view that the U.S. economy could benefit from offshoring lower-value U.S. manufacturing in order to lower consumer costs, while encouraging the domestic growth of higher-value industries like software, healthcare, and value-added manufacturing. As Clinton put it in 1993, ""this debate about NAFTA is a debate about whether we will embrace [economic] changes and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist these changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structures of yesterday."" Trade globalization was thought to create opportunities for new U.S. exports, encourage innovation by forcing companies to compete globally, and lower consumer costs. Furthering Clinton's argument in support of NAFTA and an aspirational Latin America free trade deal, policymakers also thought that an expanded U.S. trade block could deliver the economies of scale needed to compete with the emerging European Union trade block and growing intra-Asian regional trade.

With the texts of the deals themselves, trade policymakers sought to promote the then-prevailing economic consensus in Washington, which championed reduced government subsidies; nondiscrimination for goods produced by other countries; lower regulatory burdens for business, including the then-nascent digital economy; and strong intellectual property (IP) protections. Policymakers also sought to promote higher labor and environmental standards and to tackle challenges like corruption. Senior figures in Washington often spoke of these goals as raising standards internationally and writing global rules based on U.S. rules.

The WTO's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), which went into effect in 1995, for example, drastically expanded the pre-WTO GATT's disciplines regarding industrial subsidies. Throughout the text of the WTO agreements and U.S. FTAs, countries agreed to accord ""national treatment"" to each other's goods, committing not to give preference to domestically produced goods. In most U.S. FTAs, and with respect to the countries that have signed up to the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement, this nondiscrimination commitment even extended to government procurement of goods -- meaning that the U.S. government, for example, should not show a preference for U.S.-made cars over foreign cars when buying for the federal fleet. Of course, these agreements also required governments to allow U.S. companies to bid on their procurement contracts.

U.S. FTAs typically included chapters ensuring that FTA partners offered IP protections comparable to U.S. IP protections. Several also sought to codify legal immunity for digital platforms regarding content posted by their users, just as platforms have immunity in the United States from lawsuits over user-posted content. Free data flows generally were protected, and governments made other commitments to not limit the operations of digital platforms operating in their countries. Trade policymakers also regularly touted deal language that promoted workers' rights and environmental standards.

The final chapter of this era of trade policymaking was President Barack Obama's support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal between a dozen economies in the Americas and Asia negotiated by the Obama administration in 2016. The TPP expanded on earlier FTAs from the 2000s and early 2010s, including by developing new disciplines on state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation. But the Obama administration made its case for the TPP largely on geopolitical grounds, arguing that it would be an important economic counterweight to China's influence in the Pacific and an economic pillar of the administration's ""pivot to China.""

Obama signed the TPP in January 2016. But even as he pushed for congressional ratification of the deal, it was becoming clear that the trade paradigm that had dominated Washington policy discussions since the early 1990s was falling out of favor. By late 2015, key congressional leaders had begun to express skepticism of the emerging TPP provisions, and ultimately they never scheduled a vote on the deal. Both of the major presidential candidates in 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton (who had supported the early development of the TPP while serving as Obama's secretary of state) and Republican Donald Trump, opposed the deal on the campaign trail, and Trump withdrew the United States from the deal shortly after his inauguration in 2017. (The other members of the deal, led by Japan, moved forward and completed the deal, rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, in 2018.)

Obama signed the TPP in January 2016. But even as he pushed for congressional ratification of the deal, it was becoming clear that the trade paradigm that had dominated Washington policy discussions since the early 1990s was falling out of favor.

As president, Trump generally eschewed traditional trade deals in favor of a tariff-heavy approach to trade, intended to put pressure on China while protecting U.S. industries, like steel, that he deemed important. Nevertheless, he did successfully enact the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), an overhaul of the NAFTA agreement from twenty-five years earlier. And while some in the trade policy and national security communities hoped that Biden would launch negotiations to reenter the TPP, Biden has instead launched trade initiatives like the IPEF that are intended promote cooperation on trade and standards but do not provide access to the U.S. market as traditional FTAs would. And even without U.S. market access, such initiatives have proved politically controversial. In November 2023, for instance, Biden indefinitely postponed finalization of the trade-related aspects of IPEF owing to concerns by Democrats in Congress that the deal would be politically harmful and due to opposition by American labor unions. Biden also quietly postponed nascent trade talks with the United Kingdom and Kenya that began in the last months of the Trump administration, and late last year his trade representative, Katherine Tai, withdrew long-standing U.S. support for proposed digital trade rules at the WTO. Trump, in his campaign to regain the presidency this year, has doubled down on his commitment to tariffs and other protectionist measures rather than deals, floating the idea of imposing a 60 percent tariff on goods imported from China and a 10 percent tariff on products imported from everywhere else.

Of course, trade has long been a hot-button political issue. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot made his opposition to NAFTA a signature issue in his 1992 independent presidential campaign against Bill Clinton and incumbent George H. W. Bush, and trade deal approvals have always been hard fought in Congress. But for the twenty-five-year period between 1990 and the mid-2010s, geopolitical and economic logic were able to overcome that political opposition to see deals to fruition. Today, there is scant evidence that new trade deals could get through Congress, and a dwindling number of elected political leaders are willing to argue in favor of them. There are several reasons for this change in political support.

Trade has long been a hot-button political issue. Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot made his opposition to NAFTA a signature issue in his 1992 independent presidential campaign against Bill Clinton and incumbent George H. W. Bush, and trade deal approvals have always been hard fought in Congress.

The first is the shifting U.S. relationship with China. Although economic research from the 1990s and early 2000s generally found that expanding U.S. trade flows had at most a limited impact on U.S. manufacturing employment, with other factors such as automation playing a larger role, research from the mid- and late 2010s found that the ""China shock"" of growing U.S.-China trade in the 2000s had substantially more disruptive impacts on jobs. Moreover, communities adversely impacted by the China shock have seen little recovery over the past decade. Adverse employment impacts from trade with China, combined with China's rise as a geopolitical competitor, have led to bipartisan support for ""derisking"" U.S. supply chains from China, fueled the arguments of trade skeptics, and renewed a focus on U.S. domestic manufacturing.

The second reason is shifts in domestic political preferences. It is true that some polling shows that the majority of Americans are supportive of trade: a 2023 poll commissioned by the Chicago Council for Global Affairs, for example, found that 74 percent of Americans say ""trade is good for the U.S. economy."" But as prominent economist Alan Blinder pointed out several years ago in Foreign Affairs, ""most Americans' belief in free trade is a mile wide but an inch deep,"" with polling responses varying widely depending on which questions are being asked and whether Americans are asked only about trade in the abstract or also about American manufacturing and jobs.

Trade policy is a classic example of an issue where a constituency that is invested deeply in and affected by an issue, such as specific U.S. industries and workers who face the risk of losses from trade, exert more influence than a majority of voters who may benefit from lower prices but who do not see their well-being as being deeply connected to trade issues. Recent polling by American Compass, a conservative organization that is skeptical of trade deals, has also shown that while a plurality of Americans thinks they personally benefit from globalization, a similar plurality thinks the United States as a whole has been harmed. Other recent polling suggests that on trade, more Americans trust Trump, with his zeal for tariffs, than trust Biden. Academic research, meanwhile, indicates that while Trump's tariffs were an economic mixed bag, they won Republicans votes at the ballot box.

A third reason is that the raw economic benefits of trade deals have become less compelling. Take the TPP as an example: even the Obama administration's own official estimate found that the TPP would add just 0.15 percent to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) after a decade, hardly a compelling economic justification for the deal. And in the years since Trump abandoned the deal, actual U.S. trade flows have still moved in a beneficial direction: China's share of U.S. goods imports declined from a high of over 20 percent in the late 2010s to approximately 15 percent last year, while the absolute value of U.S. goods imports from China fell last year to the lowest level in a decade. Trade with allies and partners also has grown: since 2017, U.S imports of goods from India are up 37 percent, up 80 percent from Indonesia, up 61 percent from the Philippines, and up a whopping 200 percent from Vietnam -- the last of these now exports goods valued at a quarter of its entire GDP to the United States. The United States became India's largest trading partner in 2023, while U.S. exports to the European Union and European imports from the United States are both up more than 25 percent over the past few years. Overall U.S. exports today substantially exceed prepandemic levels, reflecting growing global demand for U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufactured goods, as well as U.S. services.

Meanwhile, Americans traditionally thought to be adversely impacted by trade are doing well. Real wages for lower-income Americans grew strongly in 2023, and, in a reversal of the trend that has prevailed for most of the past two decades, the real wage growth for lower-income Americans over the past two years has been higher than the rate of wage growth for higher-income Americans. Women and Black Americans also saw historic gains in the labor market. A situation where both U.S. companies and U.S. workers are doing well creates little incentive to open U.S. markets to more competition. Numbers like these reinforce skepticism about the benefits of new FTAs.

Americans traditionally thought to be adversely impacted by trade are doing well. Real wages for lower-income Americans grew strongly in 2023.

But perhaps the most important reason for declining U.S. political support for new trade deals is that the economic theory of the case that underpinned the deals of the 1990s to the mid-2010s has fallen out of favor in Washington. At a fundamental level, a bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington that the United States should rebuild its manufacturing industrial base and focus more on the economic well-being of American workers. Irrespective of whether prioritizing manufacturing optimizes American economic growth, there is strong political support for doing so.

In some sectors, U.S. domestic support for reindustrialization is driven by geopolitics: Congress's bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act in 2022, which will provide more than $75 billion in incentives for manufacturing semiconductors in the United States, was driven in part by concern that a conflict between China and Taiwan could cut off America's access to the chips it needs for industrial, defense, and consumer applications. In other sectors, such as manufacturing clean energy technologies, the push for reindustrialization is driven by a combination of geopolitical desires -- ensuring that the United States is not dependent on China for green technologies -- as well as domestic economic interests in boosting manufacturing employment in emerging manufacturing sectors. Across the political aisle, Biden's trade representative Katherine Tai and Trump's former trade representative Robert Lighthizer are united in a view that a goal of trade policy should be to raise wages and well-being for workers and that, for too long, trade policy has focused on benefits to consumers.

At a macroeconomic level, this desire to reindustrialize in many respects runs counter to the economic theory that underpinned many of the major trade deals of the past, which posited that U.S. workers would move up into ""higher value"" sectors like information technology, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing as the United States offshored lower-value (and lower profit margin) types of manufacturing. Moreover, many of the tools that policymakers want to deploy to rebuild manufacturing may run up against the trade rules that the United States long supported. Many of the United States' European and Asian allies, for example, argue that the manufacturing subsidies the United States adopted in the CHIPS Act and particularly the green energy-focused Inflation Reduction Act violate the spirit and likely the letter of provisions of the WTO and U.S. trade agreements that long sought to limit industrial subsidies or at least give countries the right to retaliate against them. Likewise, ""Buy America"" provisions that direct the U.S. government to purchase American-made products run counter to trade rules on government procurement long supported by the United States.

The United States confronts a similar dynamic with respect to policymakers' preferences on technology and the digital economy. Going back to the early days of the internet and continuing through the 2019 U.S.-Japan digital agreement, U.S. trade agreements have sought to promote light-touch regulation of the tech sector, guarantee the free flow of data across borders, and protect tech companies from lawsuits for content posted online. Today, Democrats and Republicans alike are pursuing a much more aggressive regulatory approach to technology companies, including competition policy crackdowns, efforts to repeal companies' immunity for content posted online, and increased restrictions on cross-border data flows, at least to China. Some members of Congress and policy experts in the United States even want to revisit long-standing patent and copyright protections -- such as the Biden administration's current consideration of exercising ""march in rights"" to override patents to reduce drug costs -- arguing that U.S. law has become too protective of intellectual property. The rise of generative AI is also likely to prompt a profound reassessment of intellectual property protections. These shifting domestic preferences, much like America's growing preference for industrial policy, in many ways run counter to provisions historically supported in U.S. trade deals and will require a reassessment and overhaul of the trade rules America pushes for.

Faced with fading support for FTAs, over the past two years trade-focused experts, industry lobbies, and protrade officials in Washington have floated a number of ways to reboot support for trade deals. The most popular approach has been to lean heavily on geopolitical arguments for trade. Commentators and political figures from across the political spectrum have argued that geopolitical competition with China makes trade deals with allies important: a late 2023 report by the bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on China, for example, argued that to compete with China the United States should ""pursue trade agreements with strong rules of origin and high standards,"" and it suggested Taiwan and possibly the United Kingdom and Japan as partners. As the Washington Post put it more succinctly in the title of a 2023 editorial, ""To compete with China, the U.S. should put real trade deals on the table.""

Geopolitics has been the driving argument for the Biden administration's IPEF. As Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at a 2022 launch event, the IPEF ""marks an important turning point in restoring U.S. economic leadership in the region and presenting Indo-Pacific countries an alternative to China's approach to these critical issues."" Commentators such as Matthias Dopfner, meanwhile, have argued that Western democratic states should create a democratic trading block that increasingly would align trade policy with values while establishing the type of large economic scale that drives the efficiency gains that have been a long-standing economic argument for trade.

The idea of a broad democratic trading bloc is appealing as a long-term vision. But there is little reason to expect that geopolitical arguments for trade will prevail in the debate -- particularly after they failed both to gain support for the TPP and to prevent Biden from postponing the IPEF trade pillar. The political and policy reality is that, aside from America's robust defense budget, Americans are wary of policies that they perceive as requiring the American taxpayer to pay for the benefit of even other democratic states, as evidenced by the comparatively low levels of U.S. foreign assistance, and, more recently, the sharp congressional debate over continuing U.S. military and economic support to Ukraine. Framing trade deals as a sort of tax the United States should pay to strengthen the democratic world against China and other autocracies is unlikely to be a winning argument in the American heartland without a healthy dose of economic self-interest thrown in as well. Moreover, a number of large emerging market democracies that would be an important part of a democratic trading block, such as India and Brazil, have traditionally pursued protectionists trade policies and seem unlikely to be interested in a broad market liberalization in the near or mid-term.

The idea of a broad democratic trading bloc is appealing as a long-term vision. But there is little reason to expect that geopolitical arguments for trade will prevail in the debate.

A handful of former officials, seeing the political success of the USMCA -- Trump's updated NAFTA -- have argued that the new agreement could be expanded to add additional members, potentially ultimately countries on both sides of the Pacific. But here, too, both the politics and the policies likely would prove challenging. Although there was broad bipartisan support for USMCA, that support reflected the fact that the United States already had a trade deal with Mexico and Canada (NAFTA) and bipartisan recognition that after twenty-five years, elements of NAFTA were in need of an update. Adding more countries, which would de facto result in the United States entering into new agreements with countries that did not have preexisting FTAs, would carry a different and almost certainly more challenging set of political dynamics. Instead, the way to reset the trade agenda is to start by resetting the economic logic of deals. If successful periods of trade policymaking have occurred in the past when the United States saw deals as advancing both its economic and its geopolitical interests, policymakers need deals that work on the economics as well as the geopolitics.

To reset the economics, policymakers should start by thinking less about traditional goals of market liberalization and more about discrete global challenges that require international economic cooperation -- and possible ways of using trade deals to address those challenges. This would almost certainly mean pivoting from a bilateral or regional approach to trade to a sectoral approach to trade that brings together different sets of international partners to address discrete challenges.

To reset the economics, policymakers should start by thinking less about traditional goals of market liberalization and more about discrete global challenges that require international economic cooperation.

Start with climate and energy. Global climate change poses an existential threat, as carbon dioxide emissions hit a new global high in 2023 despite years of international promises to address the problem. The United States accounts for only about 15 percent of total global emissions, whereas traded goods and services account for perhaps 25 percent of global emissions. Trade policy offers a powerful tool to tackle the 85 percent of emissions that originate outside the United States. Meanwhile, many U.S. allies and partners face a near-term challenge of securing their supplies of traditional fossil fuel energy, particularly following Russia's 2022 war on Ukraine. European allies, for example, have had to scramble to find substitutes for Russian oil and gas. Even the United States remains far too dependent on Russia for uranium for nuclear power.

A climate and energy agreement could bring together a group of countries with the technologies and critical materials needed to produce clean energy, such as South Korea on battery technology, Indonesia for critical minerals, and the European Union for its role in clean power. The countries could work together to coordinate clean energy supply chains and industrial policies to promote the adoption and manufacturing of clean energy technologies. They also could commit to technological cooperation on clean energy technologies, with members, for example, offering streamlined permitting for nuclear energy construction from other member states. As with any trade deal, there would be an economic give and take: the United States and Europe, for instance, could offer countries access to incentives for green energy manufacturing in exchange for reliable access to critical inputs produced with high environmental and labor standards.

A climate and energy agreement could bring together a group of countries with the technologies and critical materials needed to produce clean energy.

Meanwhile, the United States and Canada, major producers of traditional fossil fuels, could commit to providing access to fuels such as liquefied natural gas to address near-term energy security needs while the green transition is underway. The United States also could commit to maintaining high tariffs on Chinese clean energy technologies, including Chinese clean energy technologies produced in third countries, leveraging supply chain diversification away from China as an incentive for participation. It might also make efforts to lean heavily on the European Union and other allies to agree to impose similar tariffs on their imports of green energy products, such as electric vehicles (EVs), from China.

Conversely, countries could coordinate so-called carbon border adjustment mechanisms, which impose tariffs on products based on their carbon emissions, to put pressure on nonmember states like China and other highly polluting countries to reduce their emissions as well. Indeed, the United States and Europe are already discussing miniature versions of coordinated trade action for the clean economy. The proposed Global Arrangement for Sustainable Steel and Aluminum would promote trade in low-carbon steel and aluminum products, and proposed agreements on critical minerals would offer foreign battery materials makers some access to U.S. Inflation Reduction Act subsidies. These nascent steps could be bolstered and expanded into a compelling agenda.

A second sectoral area for trade policy focus would be to develop an ""economic security"" arrangement that coordinated industrial policy measures while strengthening supply chains for critical products. Countries such as Germany and Japan have joined the United States in pursuing new industrial policy measures, as in the case of the European CHIPS Act, which provides incentives for semiconductor manufacturing in Europe to match the U.S. version. Although this approach is welcome, in that it will likely spur further global production of important products like green technologies and semiconductors, poorly coordinated industrial policy measures risk triggering global subsidy fights and creating incentives for companies to play governments off against one another in a bid to maximize subsidies beyond those strictly needed to spur a project.

Meanwhile, the United States continues to face significant supply chain risks for other key products, such as medical devices and pharmaceutical ingredients. The production of many pharmaceuticals ingredients and some medical devices is concentrated on China and India. The United States, Europe, Israel, and a number of other countries, however, have a strong interest in resilience. An economic security arrangement could enable like-minded countries to coordinate industrial policy measures and promote supply chain resilience across critical products.

An economic security arrangement could enable like-minded countries to coordinate industrial policy measures and promote supply chain resilience across critical products.

A final area for a sectoral agreement is AI and the digital economy. The United States has already begun to promote shared global standards for AI development through the G7's Hiroshima process. Over time, an AI and digital economy agreement could link G7 political agreements into binding commitments for a larger number of countries to adopt. With respect to the digital economy, such agreements could establish shared standards and rules of managing data flows to strategic competitors, notably China, to prohibitions on government review of source code for apps and software developed in participating countries and expanded access to the digital economy and trusted telecommunications network infrastructure.

Sectoral agreements also would let the United States reconceptualize the tools that are included in a trade agreement. Since the first modern FTA in the 1980s, American trade agreements have focused on reducing tariffs and aligning regulations, generally around American standards. But trade -- the actual exchange of goods and services and the associated economic activity -- depends at least as much on policies and tools outside the scope of these FTAs as it does on FTA provisions: effective infrastructure, streamlined permitting processes, access to capital, and a skilled workforce. It is time for the United States to open the aperture of what a trade agreement can include to bring in a larger set of tools and potential commitments. For example, an AI and digital economy agreement should not be limited to governance and regulatory standards -- it also should include meaningful financial commitments to help developing-world partner countries procure secure Western telecommunications equipment, rather than relying on Chinese suppliers. Similarly, a climate and energy agreement should include commitments to work together on streamlining the permitting process for high-priority projects that require a footprint across participating countries.

National security tools should also be on the table. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and export controls have come to play a far more prominent role in the international economy in recent years. Here, the United States should use trade deals in an offensive rather than defensive manner, for example, using trade deals to lock in commitments by foreign governments to restrict Chinese acquisitions of strategic companies in their countries. But the United States should also use its own national security tools as an incentive. A climate and energy agreement, for example, should promise to whitelist reputable automotive companies from allied nations like Japan for streamlined CFIUS approval, ensuring that they can invest in promising EV and autonomous driving companies in the United States. A digital economy agreement could include commitments not to impose export controls on allies without advance notice and consultation.

Finally, sectoral deals will let the United States focus trade provisions on specific facilities, rather than country of production. When the Trump administration negotiated the USMCA, for example, it included novel provisions that required workers to be paid at least $16 an hour for automotive parts to qualify for USMCA tariff treatment -- essentially meaning that only certain Mexican plants qualify. Sectoral trade agreements are well suited to take this type of approach: a climate and energy agreement, for example, could offer foreign-made electric parts access to some of the subsidies contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, but only for facilities that meet the highest labor and environmental standards.

Sectoral agreements also offer a new set of opportunities -- to reframe trade deals as solving tangible problems that matter to the American people and to the world at large, and to negotiate rules that would internationalize some domestic policy changes within the United States.

Negotiating large sectoral agreements undoubtedly will be challenging, as countries argue over the scope of covered sectors, market access, and the commitments to put on the table. But sectoral agreements also offer a new set of opportunities -- to reframe trade deals as solving tangible problems that matter to the American people and to the world at large, and to negotiate rules that would internationalize some domestic policy changes within the United States.

Of course, a rebooted U.S. trade agenda is not just about deals with allies -- it also requires addressing the U.S. trade relationship with China.

For many years, the strategic paradigm of U.S. trade policy toward China was defined by the hope that economic ties would persuade China to continue on a course of gradual economic and political liberalization. By the mid-2010s, it was clear that this paradigm had failed, prompting Trump to impose sweeping tariffs in a bid to generate negotiating leverage to compel China to change its economic model. China responded to the tariffs, initially with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like agricultural products, and ultimately Trump offered tens of billions of dollars in assistance to U.S. farmers to offset the impacts of Chinese tariffs. Later, China offered a handful of concessions as part of a ""Phase 1"" trade deal, largely to avoid a threatened future tariff escalation. However, China steadfastly refused to make more fundamental changes to its economy and market, and there is no evidence that China's willingness to reform has increased in the years since.

Moreover, even in the unlikely event that China made additional trade concessions to the United States, it is far from clear that they should be accepted: the United States has a strategic interest in reducing its dependencies on China in critical goods irrespective of whether China offers better terms on trade. For example, even if China somehow offered to allow American firms to produce critical minerals or EV batteries in China on fair terms, the United States has a strategic interest in ensuring that its domestic markets are not reliant on those supplies. The United States of course should pursue appropriate, fair terms for trade in nonstrategic goods, but when it comes to critical products, the U.S. objective should be to derisk the relationship, not for American and Chinese firms to compete on a level playing field.

Even in the unlikely event that China made additional trade concessions to the United States, it is far from clear that they should be accepted.

Against that backdrop, the United States should rebalance its China tariffs to prioritize derisking rather than leverage for a deal. For example, it should raise tariffs on products where supply chain vulnerabilities remain acute, like EVs, batteries, medicines, and critical materials, while potentially offering some reductions in tariffs on nonstrategic consumer goods.

Effective derisking will require more than simple tariffs on China, however: it also will require measures to reduce the Chinese content in imports from third countries. There is a growing body of evidence, for example, that some of America's growing imports from Vietnam are of products composed mostly of Chinese components, with low-value finishing work done in Vietnam. The United States needs to revisit the so-called rules of origin that determine what a product's country of origin is for tariff purposes to begin derisking the upstream elements of critical supply chains. It also needs to figure out how to tackle China's dominance in a handful of strategic construction industries, like shipbuilding and port infrastructure, where China's impacts are global.

Though a U.S. pivot to sectoral agreements and more active management of the U.S.-China trade relationship could offer the potential to reboot the U.S. trade agenda, it will draw even more questions from U.S. allies about whether the United States has any residual support for the WTO. The WTO still serves as a basic framework for trade between nearly 200 countries, but the simple, often unspoken reality is that many American policymakers today regard the WTO as an outdated institution that reflects a different geopolitical moment. One of the WTO's core tenets is that countries would accord each other preferential ""most favored nation"" trade status, in that the United States would set similar tariffs for both competitors like China and allies like Germany. With the resurrection of great power geopolitics as a defining feature of international relations, for most American policymakers it makes little sense for the United States to promote a global trading regime. Instead, most U.S. policymakers would prefer to see the development of a U.S.-centered trading bloc or blocs among allies and partners.

That said, most of America's allies remain committed to the WTO, for understandable reasons. As the world's largest economy, the United States is relatively well-positioned to negotiate bilateral or plurilateral agreements with major trading partners. Most small and midsize countries, however, strongly benefit from a stable global trading system rather than having to negotiate hundreds of bespoke agreements. The WTO also offers smaller countries a set of rules they see as being a valuable check on both the protectionist actions of large countries and for smaller countries to manage trade among themselves. The WTO itself, meanwhile, requires consensus for major changes, making reform unlikely. Moreover, a U.S. withdrawal from the WTO would be costly. It would result in more than one hundred countries around the world having the right to impose higher tariffs on the United States. To avoid that outcome, the United States would have to negotiate an unmanageable number of new deals in a short time frame.

The WTO also offers smaller countries a set of rules they see as being a valuable check on both the protectionist actions of large countries and for smaller countries to manage trade among themselves.

Unfortunately, there is no clear path forward to resolve global differences on the WTO, given differences of both interest and opinion between the United States and its partners. The simplest path is likely for the United States and China, or perhaps the G7 on one side and China on the other, to reach a kind of mutual detente in which WTO rules would not actually govern trade between them. In many ways, this scenario would simply codify and expand the existing de facto reality between Washington and Beijing, where both Trump's 2018 tariffs on China and China's retaliation violate WTO rules, but the two governments effectively have reached a mutual understanding on tariff rates that simply exist outside the WTO system. Over the longer term, however, the world may see global trade continue to move toward discrete blocs -- and this trend is already well underway. But there is not yet any international consensus on what a vision for that future would look like.

Of course, for many Americans, and many policymakers, a rational lesson of the past few years could be that American trade policy does not need a reboot. Supply chains are diversifying away from China, U.S. exports are up, and real wages for workers are rising. Even if allies and partners complain about the lack of new American trade deals, rising actual trade volumes and closer defense relationships, like the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal with Australia and the UK and closer U.S. military cooperation with the Philippines, help to strengthen geopolitical ties. And even policymakers who want to use trade deals to strengthen geopolitical relations have to acknowledge that the correlation between economic and geopolitical relations is far from perfect. After all, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 despite decades of European policy aimed at using trade to anchor Russia economically into the West. As Lighthizer told a House committee last year, the iconic rock band the Beatles taught him that ""money can't buy me love"" and that he doubted that ""transferring our wealth to these people is going to make them like us more.""

The best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy.

The strongest argument for rebooting U.S. trade policy ultimately may not be geopolitics, nor even the economic argument that trade deals will help an already-strong U.S economy. Instead, the best argument is that trade is a key element of solving global challenges that affect us all, like the green energy transition and the risks of AI and the digital economy. For trade policy to advance those goals, and win the domestic support that will be needed to make them happen, it is time to develop a trade policy designed around them.

Although China's emissions currently far outpace those of the United States, China and many developing countries argue that Western industrial countries are responsible for a historically large share of global emissions. The United States, for example, is the largest total emitter of greenhouse gas emissions across history. This fact raises important issues of equity with respect to developing countries.

Policymakers are relying on conventional wisdom about the course of the war, the sustainability of Western support, and the circumstances under which the war might end. Some of these are accurate, but many are not. This paper explores ten commonly heard arguments or assumptions about the war in Ukraine and assesses whether or not they are accurate.

Unstated assumptions are often at the core of our foreign policy decisions; whether they realize it or not, policymakers are drawing from implicit beliefs and mental models of how the world works to answer critical questions.Stephen Walt, ""Leaving Theory Behind: Why Simplistic Hypothesis Testing Is Bad for International Relations,"" European Journal of International Relations 19, no. 3 (2013): 427-457. These assumptions can be big and wide-ranging, i.e., whether China is a revisionist power, whether the world is multipolar, or whether democracies fight wars better than autocracies. Many have been subject to academic study by political scientists and historians, though policymakers may not necessarily be aware of this fact.

Nowhere have untested assumptions become more problematic in the last few years than in discussions of the war in Ukraine. Indeed, because the debate on Ukraine has become so politically charged, many of these arguments are themselves increasingly polemical in nature, designed to provoke an emotional response in one direction or the other. Many also contain a kernel of truth, while obscuring important or broader points. Yet understanding which of these assumptions are true, which are false, and which are more nuanced is necessary if we are to understand how the war might develop - or how it might end. This paper examines ten of the most common arguments and assumptions about the war in Ukraine.

This is a question that cannot be answered easily; whether any policy choice is affordable or not depends on your own views about government spending, the national debt, and the priorities of the U.S. government. ""America's Fiscal Future,"" Government Website, U.S. Government Accountability Office, May 8, 2023, https://www.gao.gov/americas-fiscal-future. But here are some concrete facts about the costs of support for Ukraine and how it compares to other spending: In the first two years of the war, Congress appropriated about $175 billion related to the costs of the war in Ukraine, predominantly for arms.Jonathan Masters and Will Merrow, ""How Much U.S. Aid Is Going to Ukraine?,"" Council on Foreign Relations (blog), May 9, 2024, https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine. This amounts to approximately $60 billion dollars per year - if one assumes the most recent supplemental lasts about a year - and is equivalent to about seven percent of the annual U.S. defense budget per year.

Critics would argue that this is a bargain: the ability to attrite the Russian military for less than ten percent of our annual military spending is a great deal. They are undoubtedly right when talking about 2022, and perhaps even 2023. Where this assumption becomes more problematic, though, is in the long run. Spending seven or eight percent of the defense budget per year on Ukraine will add up significantly over time, contributing not just to spending levels, but also - as we learned during the war on terror - ramping up the national debt. This level of cost repeated over five to seven years is far less sustainable than a one-time addition to the defense budget; it's also a cost with diminishing marginal gains.

Opportunity cost is perhaps the most relevant metric here. Depending on where you land on the political spectrum, perhaps you would prefer to spend this money on domestic programs, or on returning money to taxpayers. But even if we were to assume this money would get spent on national security regardless, seven or eight percent of the defense budget per year to Ukraine is a significant opportunity cost for money that could potentially be spent elsewhere on improving U.S. capabilities or readiness. This amount of money could double the budget of the State Department, for example, purchase multiple aircraft carriers, or fund four of the new ballistic missile submarines needed to modernize the nuclear triad. Emily McCabe and Cory Gill, ""Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs: FY2024 Budget and Appropriations"" (Washington D.C.: Congressional Research Service, January 24, 2024), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47579; Mallory Shelbourne, ""Cost Estimates for Lead Boat in Columbia-Class Program Grow by $637M,"" USNI News (blog), June 7, 2021, https://news.usni.org/2021/06/07/cost-estimates-for-lead-boat-in-columbia-class-program-grow-by-637m.

The Biden administration and some of its Republican supporters have been keen to point out that most of the money that the United States is 'sending' to Ukraine remains within the U.S. economy.Marc Thiessen, ""Ukraine Aid's Best-Kept Secret: Most of the Money Stays in the U.S.A.,"" Washington Post, November 29, 2023, https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/29/ukraine-military-aid-american-economy-boost/. The Pentagon spends money primarily with defense contractors to produce weapons which are then sent to Ukraine. In doing so, proponents argue, the spending creates American jobs and strengthens our defense industrial base.C. Todd Lopez, ""Ukraine Security Assistance Strengthens Nation's Defense Industrial Base,"" U.S. Department of Defense, November 29, 2023, https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3601120/ukraine-security-assistance-strengthens-nations-defense-industrial-base/; Elizabeth Hoffman et al., ""How Supporting Ukraine Is Revitalizing the U.S. Defense Industrial Base"" (Washington D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies, April 18, 2024), https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-supporting-ukraine-revitalizing-us-defense-industrial-base. This argument is often combined with the idea that the president's use of his drawdown authority to aid Ukraine - the process through which the United States sends military surplus overseas and backfills with new, more modern equipment - is improving U.S. capabilities as a result of these upgrades.Mackenzie Eaglen, ""Most of the Money in the 'Foreign Aid' Bill Would Stay in the U.S.,"" The Dispatch, February 16, 2024, https://thedispatch.com/article/most-of-the-money-in-the-foreign-aid-bill-would-stay-in-the-u-s/.

There's a kernel of truth to this: much of the money appropriated for weapons will in fact go to U.S. defense contractors to manufacture armaments. However, again, it is worth considering the question of opportunity costs in government spending. Military Keynesianism - spending on weapons and defense to bolster the domestic economy - is one of the least effective means of stimulating economic growth.Jan Toporowski, ""The War in Ukraine and the Revival of Military Keynesianism"" (Institute for New Economic Thinking, January 9, 2023), https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/the-war-in-ukraine-and-the-revival-of-military-keynesianism; Benjamin Zycher, ""Economic Effects of Reductions in Defense Outlays"" (Washington D.C.: Cato Institute, August 8, 2012), https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/economic-effects-reductions-defense-outlays; Heidi Garrett-Peltier, ""War Spending and Lost Opportunities,"" Costs of War Project (Providence, RI: Brown University, March 2019), https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2019/March%202019%20Job%20Opportunity%20Cost%20of%20War.pdf. It's likely that if this money were spent elsewhere, it would create more growth and more jobs than it is for the purpose of supplying arms to Ukraine.

The benefits to the U.S. industrial base and defense stockpiles are also mixed. It is undoubtedly true that earlier in the conflict much of what America was sending - to Ukraine or to European allies as part of swap arrangements - was older equipment, thereby allowing the Pentagon to backfill its own stocks with more modern systems and newer ammunition. But this argument looks weaker going forward. For one thing, it presents clear diminishing returns over time; once equipment has been upgraded, then any future drawdown will simply have to send more expensive, more modern weapons to Ukraine with no backfill benefit. For another, the U.S. defense industrial base lacks the capacity it needs to meet all demands placed upon it; companies have not kept pace with the need for weapons, and in some cases backfilling these systems has been slow and inefficient.William LaPlante, Jamie Morin, and Jennifer Stewart, ""Is the U.S. Military Industrial Base Prepared?"" (Council on Foreign Relations, May 3, 2023), https://www.cfr.org/event/us-military-industrial-base-prepared; Seth G. Jones, ""Empty Bins in a Wartime Environment: The Challenge to the U.S. Defense Industrial Base"" (Washington D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies, January 23, 2023), https://www.csis.org/analysis/empty-bins-wartime-environment-challenge-us-defense-industrial-base; John Barrett, ""You Go to War With the Industrial Base You Have, Not the Industrial Base You Want,"" War on the Rocks, August 16, 2023, https://warontherocks.com/2023/08/you-go-to-war-with-the-industrial-base-you-have-not-the-industrial-base-you-want/.

The Pentagon has struggled in recent months to meet the demand for supplies to Ukraine, Israel, and other uses; this shortage was also behind the decision by the Biden administration to send old, stockpiled cluster munitions to Ukraine back in 2023.Mark F. Cancian, ""Cluster Munitions: What Are They, and Why Is the United States Sending Them to Ukraine?"" (Washington D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies, July 10, 2023), https://www.csis.org/analysis/cluster-munitions-what-are-they-and-why-united-states-sending-them-ukraine; Oren Liebermann Bertrand Natasha, ""US Eyes Weapons Stockpiles as Concern Grows about Supporting Both Ukraine and Israel's Wars,"" CNN, October 11, 2023, https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/politics/us-weapons-stockpiles-ukraine-israel/index.html. Under current circumstances, there are concrete tradeoffs created by this capacity shortfall that make it difficult to send Ukraine everything it needs while also supplying other U.S. partners and maintaining U.S. military readiness.Jennifer Kavanagh and Jordan Cohen, ""The True Military Assistance Tradeoff Is Between Israel and Taiwan,"" War on the Rocks, November 21, 2023, https://warontherocks.com/2023/11/the-true-military-assistance-tradeoff-is-between-israel-and-taiwan/; Alex Velez-Green, ""Managing Trade-Offs Between Military Aid for Taiwan and Ukraine"" (Washington D.C.: Heritage Foundation, August 31, 2023), https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/managing-trade-offs-between-military-aid-taiwan-and-ukraine; Michael Poznansky, ""The Ukraine-Taiwan Tradeoff,"" Foreign Affairs, January 5, 2024, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/ukraine-taiwan-tradeoff.

For the first year of the war, it often seemed that European states were not contributing as much - particularly in military aid to Ukraine - as the United States. It is also true that these states were simultaneously bearing the brunt of refugee costs and the energy crisis, both of which were indirect results of the war; though experiencing inflation, the United States has not been impacted as severely by these costs. Yuru Guan, Klaus Hubacek, Yuli Shan, and Jin Yan, ""Russia-Ukraine War Has Nearly Doubled Household Energy Costs Worldwide - New Study,"" (Davos: World Economic Forum, February 20, 2023), https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/02/russia-ukraine-war-energy-costs.; Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Dominic Rohner, ""The Economic Consequences of the War,"" CEPR, May 17, 2024, https://cepr.org/debates/economic-consequences-war. In direct aid, however, it has taken some time for Europe to catch up. Today, Europe and the United States are nearly neck-and-neck in the amount of aid spent on Ukraine.""Ukraine Support Tracker - A Database of Military, Financial and Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine,"" (Berlin: Kiel Institute), https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/. Where the difference emerges is when one looks at total commitments to Ukraine, where Europe leaps ahead in the amount of money pledged to Ukraine in coming years.""Ukraine Support Tracker: Europe Has a Long Way to Go to Replace US Aid - Large Gap between Commitments and Allocations,"" (Berlin: Kiel Institute, February 16, 2024), https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/europe-has-a-long-way-to-go-to-replace-us-aid-large-gap-between-commitments-and-allocations/. Yet this is mostly budgeting chicanery: where the European Union (EU) and some European states can promise future aid over a longer time horizon, the White House cannot preauthorize spending without congressional approval. Comparing future U.S. and European commitments, therefore, is an exercise in comparing apples to oranges, one which has the effect of inflating perceptions of European commitments to Ukraine. About $65 billion of these pledges from Europe, moreover, are loans, not grants, and come with the expectation of future repayment.

Another way in which such perceptions are often inflated is by comparing contributions to Ukraine as a percentage of GDP, a choice which has the effect of catapulting small European states in the Baltics and Scandinavia up the table of contributors.Wilson Beaver, ""Yes, America Is the Biggest Military Donor to Ukraine,"" (Washington D.C.: The Heritage Foundation. February 2024), https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/yes-america-the-biggest-military-donor-ukraine. But though these efforts are laudable, they are still small by absolute standards. These states are also closest to the conflict; it is unsurprising that they would feel compelled to contribute more to Ukraine's defense. These states typically do not have security concerns in other regions and can focus all their spending and efforts in Eastern Europe. Indeed, the data shows that when controlling for distance, U.S. contributions still stand far ahead of the pack, with only Germany, France, and the United Kingdom in the same league.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) does indeed predict that Russia's economy will grow more anemically in coming years as the effects of decoupling from Europe, Western sanctions, and the costs of the war itself begin to bite; IMF economists predict that Russia will move from a period of GDP growth of about three percent this year to as little as one percent in 2025.""Russian Federation and the IMF,"" International Monetary Fund, April 2024. https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/RUS. But the organization has also upgraded estimates of Russian growth several times in the last few years, and it is widely acknowledged that the Russian Central Bank has done an excellent job of managing the fiscal headwinds created by the war and the associated economic turmoil.Huileng Tan, ""Meet the Woman Who Engineered Russia's Wartime Economy and Helped Secure Another Term for Putin,"" Business Insider, April 1, 2024, https://www.businessinsider.com/elvira-nabiullina-russia-central-bank-governor-engineer-wartime-economy-putin-2024-4.

Russia's economic performance in the last few years has belied many predictions of imminent ruin. This is partly because of overoptimistic assessments of what sanctions can achieve; sanctions can be effective at creating economic pain - if not necessarily creating policy change - but are always going to be less effective when targeted at a large, oil-exporting economy like Russia.Agathe Demarais, Backfire: How Sanctions Reshape the World against U.S. Interests, Center on Global Energy Policy Series (New York: Columbia University Press, 2024). Indeed, despite the oil price cap and European transition away from Russian fossil fuels, the Kremlin has been able to find other buyers for its oil and gas and equip a fleet of so-called 'shadow tankers' that are not tied to Western financial markets. Russian oil routinely trades above the $60 price cap.Alan Rappeport, ""Russia's War Machine Revs Up as the West's Plan to Cap Oil Revenues Sputters,"" The New York Times, May 20, 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/business/russia-oil-price-cap-policy.html.

Rather than civilian economic activity, however, the Russian economy is increasingly driven by demands in the military-industrial space. Much of the growth is driven by increased production in sectors such as metals, electronics, or heavy industry. In short, much of the growth is driven by the military-industrial complex, replacing equipment destroyed in Ukraine, or manufacturing ammunition and armaments.""Russian Manufacturing Booms With Economy on War Footing,"" Bloomberg, January 31, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/russian-manufacturing-booms-with-economy-on-war-footing. Other increases in spending come from construction inside occupied areas of Ukraine; military pensions; and payments to veterans and defense industry workers. Though not a model for robust economic growth over the long term, this is undoubtedly sustainable as a means for the Russian state to subsidize demand and employment within the Russian economy.

Another problem is increasing levels of indirect support from China, which is now a major supplier of non-lethal equipment that supports the Russian war effort, including machine tools and microelectronics. Trade between Russia and China more generally is up over sixty percent since the start of the war.Kelly Ng and Yi Ma, ""How Is China Supporting Russia after It Was Sanctioned for Ukraine War?,"" BBC News, May 17, 2024, https://www.bbc.com/news/60571253. Russia is also growing its financial and trade ties with India, Southeast Asia, and the Gulf States. The country has also been effective at sourcing replacements for components and technology restricted by Western export controls.Steven Feldstein and Fiona Brauer, ""Why Russia Has Been So Resilient to Western Export Controls,"" (Washington D.C.: Carnegie Endowment, March 11, 2024), https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls.

Unfortunately for Ukraine and the West, it is increasingly clear that, with sufficient political will, even an anemic level of economic growth can likely sustain the Russian war effort for years to come. Russian leaders clearly understand this dynamic; recent reshuffles in political leadership have placed technocratic elites in charge of the Ministry of Defense, the military-industrial complex, and other vital components of the war effort.Tony Barber, ""Russia and Ukraine: Two Economies at War,""Financial Times, May 18, 2024 , https://www.ft.com/content/6c316feb-4bb2-4e1f-a125-fe4e913e8d51; In short, though it is possible that sanctions or export controls will continue to attrite Russian capabilities over time, they are not likely to prove disastrous for Russia's war effort.

This argument has become more prevalent in recent months, partly due to the congressional fight over the supplemental, as proponents of further aid have sought to emphasize the potential negative repercussions of Russian gains in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelensky has been particularly forward-leaning on this point: he told a CBS news team in March 2024 that if Ukraine falls, then Putin will want ""Kazakhstan, then the Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany.""Charlie D'Agata, Justine Redman, and Steve Berriman, ""Ukraine's Zelenskyy Warns Putin Will Push Russia's War 'Very Quickly' onto NATO Soil If He's Not Stopped,"" CBS News, March 29, 2024, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-zelenskyy-says-putin-will-threaten-nato-quickly-if-not-stopped/. The message is clear: any Russian gains in Ukraine will embolden Putin, who will come for NATO member states next, sparking a broader war.Alila Slisco, ""NATO Will Be Drawn Into War With Russia If Ukraine Loses: Lloyd Austin,"" Newsweek, February 29, 2024, https://www.newsweek.com/nato-will-drawn-war-russia-if-ukraine-loses-lloyd-austin-1874913.; Stuart Lau, ""Mike Pence Warns Putin Will Wage War on NATO If Ukraine Loses,"" POLITICO, April 18, 2024, https://www.politico.eu/article/mike-pence-vladimir-putin-russia-united-states-nato-donald-trump-ukraine/; Patricia Lopez, ""Ukraine Aid Shows MAGA Hasn't Cowed Johnson,"" Bloomberg, April 21, 2024 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-21/house-approves-ukraine-aid-deal-in-a-win-for-mike-johnson. Americans who make this case often focus on Europe as a whole, either on the economic costs of instability on the continent or embracing George W. Bush's infamous post-9/11 dictum: 'We will fight them over there so we do not have to face them in the United States of America.""George W. Bush, ""President Bush Addresses the 89th Annual National Convention of the American Legion"" (Speech, 89th Annual National Convention of the American Legion, Reno, NV, August 28, 2007), https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/08/20070828-2.html.

Few would dispute that a proxy war - in which Ukraine fights Russia on behalf of the United States - is better than a direct conflict between NATO and Russia; U.S. troops are not dying in Ukraine, and the risks of nuclear escalation remain far lower than they might in the event of direct conflict with Russia. But it does not necessarily follow from this that the logical result of failure in Ukraine would be a Russian attack on NATO. Indeed, something that has been very clear in the last two years is that NATO's Article 5 does appear to have significant deterrent power. Russia has been careful not to cross the line into direct, attributable attacks on NATO territory or troops, even as it has disregarded other norms and rules of international conduct.Jens Stoltenberg, ""Speech by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the Heritage Foundation Followed by Audience Q&A"" (Speech, Washington D.C., January 31, 2024), https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_222258.htm.

Indeed, despite the significant flows of arms and equipment from NATO countries into Ukraine, Russia has taken no steps to interdict them outside of Ukrainian territory. This suggests something important: attacking a NATO member state is a distinct proposition from attacking a non-member state. Even if Russia did have the intention to seize other parts of Eastern Europe, the calculus for starting such a conflict would be very different.

Perhaps the most problematic form of this argument is the notion that Russian victory in Ukraine could destabilize Europe and undermine trade with one of the biggest economic partners of the United States. Europe is indeed a major trade partner for the United States, and stability in Europe remains a substantial strategic interest for the United States. But it is disingenuous to link smaller failures in Ukraine to the fate of Europe as a whole. Two years of war in Ukraine have not destabilized Europe economically, and the focus of EU-U.S. trade tensions is mostly in other areas.""U.S.-EU Trade and Economic Relations,"" Congressional Research Service, June 9. 2023, https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10931. The war itself remains the primary drag on growth.Catherine Gaschka, ""OECD: War in Ukraine to Drag on Global Economy into 2023,"" AP News, September 26, 2022, https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-inflation-health-paris-china-18d11f0a6fccd1ce48f1417993dd3d14. The Cold War example is also instructive: the United States and its European partners held out against the Soviet Union for decades, prospering economically, even when Ukraine was an integral part of the USSR.

Wars are always fundamentally uncertain, and even analysts with significant expertise and knowledge of a conflict often must reassess their priors because of events. This is the phenomenon referred to by Clausewitz as the 'fog of war,' or by management gurus as VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous).Carl von Clausewitz et al., On War, (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1989); Nate Bennett and G. James Lemoine, ""What VUCA Really Means for You,"" Harvard Business Review, January 1, 2014, https://hbr.org/2014/01/what-vuca-really-means-for-you. Predicting the specific turns and twists of a war is therefore often a fool's errand. The fact that a significant number of military analysts expected early Russian military victory in this war, for example, is treated in hindsight as a failure of analysis - but it was largely a reflection of poor assumptions. It was also a reflection of the inability of analysts to predict whether peacetime forces translate into effective fighting power, or to assess the importance of intangible factors like the 'will to fight.'Nomaan Merchant and Matthew Lee, ""U.S. Intelligence Agencies Review What They Got Wrong on Russia's Invasion of Ukraine,"" PBS NewsHour, June 4, 2022, https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/u-s-intelligence-agencies-review-what-they-got-wrong-on-russias-invasion-of-ukraine.

At the same time, we are now two years into this war, which has enabled all parties to gather significant information about how the two parties have sustained and managed their war effort thus far - along with lessons about how new technology is shaping the future of war.Robert Rose, ""Biting Off What It Can Chew: Ukraine Understands Its Attritional Context,"" War on the Rocks, September 26, 2023, https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/biting-off-what-it-can-chew-ukraine-understands-its-attritional-context/; Michael Kofman and Rob Lee, ""Perseverance and Adaptation: Ukraine's Counteroffensive at Three Months,"" War on the Rocks, September 4, 2023, https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/perseverance-and-adaptation-ukraines-counteroffensive-at-three-months/; Dara Massicot, ""What Russia Got Wrong,"" Foreign Affairs, February 8, 2023, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/what-russia-got-wrong-moscow-failures-in-ukraine-dara-massicot; Margarita Konaev and Owen J. Daniels, ""The Russians Are Getting Better,"" Foreign Affairs, September 6, 2023, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/russians-are-getting-better-learning; Breaking Defense Staff and Lee Ferran, ""What Pentagon Leaders Say They Have Learned One Year on from the Battle in Ukraine,"" Breaking Defense, February 23, 2023, https://breakingdefense.sites.breakingmedia.com/2023/02/what-pentagon-leaders-say-they-have-learned-from-a-year-of-observing-the-battle-in-ukraine/; Mick Ryan, ""Russia's Adaptation Advantage,"" Foreign Affairs, February 5, 2024, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/russias-adaptation-advantage. As a result, analysts now have a much better idea of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Ukrainian and Russian militaries and can predict where the plausible outcomes may lie.

In a war of attrition like the one in Ukraine, the most important attributes for a nation are personnel and economic industrial strength. These are the attributes which - if a state is able to turn them into military power - enable combatant states to hold and occupy territory. The war has thus far confirmed this point. Russia has a deep well of manpower, a substantial stockpile of legacy Soviet military equipment to draw upon, and, despite corruption and significant failures, has shown a remarkable ability in the last two years to repurpose its economy towards wartime production.Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, ""Russian Military Objectives and Capacity in Ukraine Through 2024"" (London: RUSI, May 20, 2024), https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-military-objectives-and-capacity-ukraine-through-2024.; Jack Watling, ""In Ukraine, Russia Is Beginning to Compound Advantages,"" May 21, 2024, https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/ukraine-russia-beginning-compound-advantages.; Stephen Feldstein and Fiona Brauer, ""Why Russia Has Been So Resilient to Western Export Controls"" (Washington D.C.: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, March 11, 2024), https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls. It may not be sustainable in the long term, but for the short-to-medium term - potentially a period of several years - Russia has the advantage.Alexandra Prokopenko, (Berlin: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, March 2024), https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/is-the-kremlin-overconfident-about-russias-economic-stability?. Ukraine is a smaller nation, with significantly lower reserves of manpower and a demographic deficit; its entire economy is hostage to Russian strikes. Thus far, Ukraine has compensated for this with inflows of Western weapons and technology. But there are very few remaining areas where technology is likely to provide a significant boost, and Ukraine is facing serious pressure in manpower, where Western support cannot compensate for weakness.Andrew E. Kramer, Josh Holder, and Lauren Leatherby, ""Can Ukraine Find New Soldiers Without Decimating a Whole Generation?"" The New York Times, April 11, 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/11/world/europe/ukraine-demographics.html.; Marc Santora, ""Ukraine's Parliament Passes a Politically Fraught Mobilization Bill,"" The New York Times, April 11, 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-mobilization-bill.html. All of this suggests the grinding war of attrition between Russia and Ukraine is likely to continue, with Ukraine at a disadvantage, but Russia struggling to translate its power into major battlefield gains. The most plausible range of scenarios for the war suggests grinding conflict that moderately advantages Russia, but only in the costly conquest of tiny amounts of territory.

Much of the talk in DC over the last year or so has centered around the idea of security guarantees for Ukraine at the end of the war, with some arguing that if the West does not guarantee Ukraine's security as part of a peace deal, then Russia will be incentivized to attack again, salami-slicing off ever-increasing chunks of Ukraine.Dr. Benjamin Tallis, ""Security Guarantees for Ukraine,"" (Berlin: German Council on Foreign Relations, June 30, 2023), https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/security-guarantees-ukraine-0. This sounds reasonable but has a critical logical flaw: the role of Western credibility. The United States and its European partners have demonstrated since 2022 that they do not intend to fight a direct war with Russia over Ukraine, suggesting that any commitment to do so in the future might be viewed in Moscow merely as a paper promise.Joseph R. Biden Jr, ""President Biden: What America Will and Will Not Do in Ukraine,"" The New York Times, May 31, 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html.

A similar problem exists for promises to admit Ukraine into NATO at some unspecified future date. Indeed, it was this kind of credibility failure that contributed to the start of this conflict in 2014. The commitment by the George W. Bush administration at the 2008 NATO summit - against the advice of many other member states - to admit Georgia and Ukraine to NATO was seen as threatening by the Kremlin. At the same time, Bush's pledge offered no credible path to membership for these states - and thus no deterrent value against Russia, producing multiple wars.Paul Taylor, ""Ukraine: NATO's Original Sin,"" POLITICO, November 23, 2021 https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-nato-georgia-europe-european-union-united-states/. In short, paper promises are problematic. And admitting Ukraine into NATO as a member also carries the risk of undermining the credibility of Article 5 more broadly; if Ukraine is not worth sending American troops to fight and die in 2022 or 2024, why would accession to full NATO membership suddenly change this calculus for a U.S. president?

There is one major exception to the 'security guarantees' argument. A concrete commitment from Western states to arm Ukraine and help it build its own defenses post-war may well be a vital component of any peace settlement. Unlike a promise to directly defend Ukraine, this is a highly credible commitment; it is, after all, what Western states have been doing for the past two years. Committing to arm Ukraine, train its soldiers, and boost its military capabilities would increase Ukraine's own deterrent abilities and reduce the likelihood of future conflict - without the risks posed by offering Ukraine formal security guarantees.

A frequent refrain from policymakers and pundits over the last two years is that a ceasefire or peace settlement in Ukraine is simply impossible.Dr. Jack Watling and Reynolds, ""Russian Military Objectives and Capacity in Ukraine Through 2024."" (London: RUSI, February 13, 2024), https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-military-objectives-and-capacity-ukraine-through-2024. More reasonable versions of these arguments are time-bound, and focus on concrete facts, arguing, for example, that it might be better to delay negotiations until the balance of forces better favors Ukraine. But there are also more extreme versions of this argument, which posit that Russia will never abandon its absolutist goals, or that it is not rational enough to make an agreement.Jamie Dettmer, ""Ukraine Is Ready for a Just Peace -- Not Russia's Version of One,"" POLITICO, May 3, 2024, https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-ukraine-ready-peace-russia-war/.

These arguments are fundamentally at odds with scholarly understandings of how wars end. Indeed, for political scientists, rationalist theories of war portray conflict as part of a bargaining process, or as a continuation of the political process.James D. Fearon, ""Rationalist Explanations for War."" International Organization 49, no. 3 (1995): 379-414, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300033324. Though this may sound faintly ridiculous, it is an effective framework for understanding conflict. States that cannot manage their disagreements through political or economic means sometimes resort to force to do so, and others assume that they will get a better outcome with force than diplomacy. Wars end when both sides have extracted enough information from the conflict about the actual balance of military power - and the probability of achieving their objectives through force - that they are willing to make some kind of settlement. Settlements tend to occur when both states do not perceive significant additional benefits to continuing to fight and are willing to make concessions to avoid further bloodshed.H. E. Goemans, ""War Termination,"" in Oxford Research Encyclopedia of International Studies, 2010, https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.013.41. ; D. Wittman, ""How a War Ends: A Rational Model Approach,"" Journal of Conflict Resolution, 23, no 4 (1979): 743-763. https://doi-org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/10.1177/002200277902300408.

This is easier theorized than put into practice. Today, either Russia or Ukraine may be disincentivized from negotiating if they perceive benefits to continuing the conflict. Worse, it may not be obvious at the time that a window has opened for negotiations; such opportunities often only become apparent in hindsight. One could make a plausible argument, for example, that Ukraine had a stronger negotiating position in the fall of 2022 than it does today. At the time, however, the prospect of future gains increasing Kyiv's leverage at the negotiating table was persuasive - and no ceasefire emerged.

The longer a war continues, however, the more the true balance of forces on the ground is revealed; states should therefore begin to adjust their war aims accordingly. We have seen this process begin to occur in practice in Ukraine. After the first few months of the invasion in 2022, Russia largely shifted away from its most ambitious war aims - seizing all of Ukraine and toppling the government in Kyiv. Since that time, it has instead focused on territorial acquisition in the Donbas, and on grinding down Ukrainian resolve.Victor Andrusiv, ""Putin's War of Vanishing Goals,"" (Washington D.C.: Wilson Center (blog),

https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/putins-war-vanishing-goals.; ""Russia Says It Is Changing Its War Aims in Ukraine,"" The Economist, March 8, 2022, https://www-economist-com/europe/2022/03/28/russia-says-it-is-changing-its-war-aims-in-ukraine. Undoubtedly, the Russians would prefer to return to those earlier war aims, but facts on the ground continue to mitigate against it. Ukrainian war aims, on the other hand, have grown. At the start of the war, it was clear that Kyiv's central goal was to defend its own sovereignty, with policymakers even willing to negotiate on the questions of NATO membership and neutrality in the early months of the war.Samuel Charap and Sergey Radchenko, ""The Talks That Could Have Ended the War in Ukraine,"" Foreign Affairs, April 16, 2024, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/talks-could-have-ended-war-ukraine. Today, Kyiv's policy of territorial reacquisition is more ambitious.

But while Russia and Ukraine's war aims may remain at odds today, they will not always be so; the inability of the parties to find a ceasefire today does not preclude the possibility that they may be able to in the future.

If there has been one constant throughout the last two years, it has been the fixation of Western policymakers on Ukrainian territorial integrity, which manifests in assertions that Ukraine cannot survive or thrive if it doesn't return to its 1991 borders.Benjamin Jensen and Elizabeth Hoffman, ""Victory in Ukraine Starts with Addressing Five Strategic Problems,"" (Washington D.C.: CSIS, May 15, 2024), https://www.csis.org/analysis/victory-ukraine-starts-addressing-five-strategic-problems. Such statements imply a second, unstated assumption: that a return to these borders will inevitably produce a more durable peace settlement. Both these notions once again contradict scholarly understandings of war termination.

Within rationalist models of war, another big obstacle to ending a conflict is what political scientists call indivisible interests. In brief: there are certain issues that may be so important to one side or the other that they are unwilling to compromise, or - perhaps more commonly - there are issues on which one cannot compromise for a variety of reasons. Only one person can be king of a country, for example, and many cities cannot easily be divided in two. Resolving an indivisible issue requires the wisdom of Solomon; one cannot simply 'split the baby.'1 Kings 3:16-28.

Political science literature suggests that indivisibility is perhaps less important than one might assume. But even so, the war in Ukraine features several indivisible issues. Ukraine can either join NATO or remain neutral, for one; it cannot be half-in and half-out of the alliance. Ukraine cannot both embrace a fully Western identity as a state and remain within Russia's sphere of influence. And some of the concessions that Russia has demanded in Ukrainian domestic politics are incompatible with the sovereignty of the Ukrainian state, such as poorly defined Russian demands that Ukraine 'de-nazify' its government.Anton Troianovskim, ""Why Vladimir Putin Invokes Nazis to Justify His Invasion of Ukraine,"" New York Times, March 17, 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/world/europe/ukraine-putin-nazis.html.

But it is important to note that the one thing in this conflict that is not indivisible is territory.Paul R. Hensen and Sara McLaughlin Mitchell. ""Issue Indivisibility and Territorial Claims."" GeoJournal 64, no. 4 (2005): 275-85. http://www.jstor.org/stable/41148009. Indeed, much of what Ukraine and Russia are currently fighting over - at least in territorial terms - is almost irrelevant to big picture questions of Ukraine's economic viability, or its integration into the Euro-Atlantic system. This contrasts strongly with Russia's attempts earlier in the war to seize the port of Odessa, something which would have undermined Ukraine's economic viability.John Hudson and Anastacia Galouchka, ""In Repeat Bombing of Odessa, Putin Deepens Economic War on Ukraine,"" The Washington Post, July 7, 2023, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/29/ukraine-grain-agriculture-russia-attacks/. Whether or not Ukraine takes another twenty miles of territory in the Donbas, however, the conflict's underlying issues will remain unaddressed. This should cause us to question the idea that reclaiming territory is the most effective way to peace.

Rounding out our tour of rationalist explanations of war, we find a third argument against any ceasefire in Ukraine: the problem of credible commitments.Robert Powell, ""War as a Commitment Problem,"" International Organization 60, no. 1 (January 2006): 169-203, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818306060061. The literature on war termination argues that unless the parties to a conflict can be persuaded that a ceasefire deal is credible - and that their opponent will not simply pocket concessions and return to fighting - they will not move towards settlement. Because intentions are impossible to discern from the outside, it's not enough just to trust the promises of the other party in a peace deal; those promises must be believable or enforced in some way.

This is undoubtedly the biggest obstacle to peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. With a decade and a half of mistrust arising from the 2014 invasion, the simmering war in the Donbas, and the failed Minsk peace process, both sides are primed to expect the other party to renege on commitments. And indeed, a ceasefire or freezing of the lines in Ukraine that grants Russia some territorial concessions while failing to address any of the conflict's bigger picture issues might well produce future conflict; either side would have an incentive to build up their forces, break the ceasefire, and push for further territory.

A broader settlement that incorporates outside entities such as the United States, however, might well be more successful. So might a settlement that addresses big questions about Europe's security architecture - and Russia's place in it - going forward. Assurances to Russia about future NATO expansion, or conventional arms control limitations on either side, could help to defuse concerns about future conflict and improve the odds a settlement will succeed.Samuel Charap and Miranda Priebe, ""Avoiding a Long War: U.S. Policy and the Trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"" (Washington D.C.:RAND Corporation, January 25, 2023), https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2510-1.html. Precisely because they are controversial, however, these issues will be significantly harder to reach agreement on.

Finally, it is worth questioning the assumption that a halt in fighting in Ukraine now, followed by a resumption of conflict at a later date, would necessarily disadvantage Kyiv. Both sides would undoubtedly benefit at this point from a pause to permit rearmament and mobilization, but Ukraine might benefit more from the cessation of Russian attacks on its critical infrastructure and cities. Moreover, a cessation of hostilities would favor Ukraine in regard to its manpower deficit; every day where Ukrainian soldiers are not being killed is a win. In short, though the broader problem of a Russian-Ukrainian rematch after ceasefire remains, policymakers should also engage with the hypothetical: are Ukraine's defensive capabilities best improved in wartime or in peace?

Each of these arguments - though commonly heard in debates over U.S. support to Ukraine - are more nuanced and challenging than commonly assumed. Indeed, each of the arguments explored in this paper represents one or more implicit assumptions. Though policymakers may rely on these suppositions, they rarely examine them, or think through their implications. Adding nuance to them - and attempting to ascertain the extent to which these are true or false - is thus a vital part of an informed debate about the role of the United States and Europe in the war in Ukraine. Also notable is the fact that none of these ten assumptions answers the question of whether and to what extent Ukraine matters to U.S. interests and the resources it is willing to commit to the conflict. Arguments about the difficulties of finding a settlement, about Ukrainian membership in NATO, or even about Ukraine's battlefield prospects do little to help us understand what U.S. interests in the conflict are and the limits of those interests. This is why it is so important to frame the Ukraine debate not as an all-or-nothing proposition, but as a question about the scope of U.S. involvement, the scope of U.S. interests, and how we find a strategy that marries the first to the second.",stimson.org,news,Stimson Center,Joaquin Matamis,-0.388235294117647,454179837,3,https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tank-in-Grass.jpg,

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Two million liters of water are needed to extract 1,000 kilos of lithium. Researchers are urgently searching for substitutes that are abundant, renewable, biodegradable, safe, low-cost and with little environmental impact. The solution may be near: sodium and calcium, two abundant elements that are being investigated to prevent lithium demand from multiplying by 60 in two decades, according to European Union forecasts.

Added to the unstoppable proliferation of home and portable devices are the two biggest challenges facing society: the electrification of mobility and the storage of renewable energy to provide continuous power. ""There are not enough lithium, cobalt and nickel ions to satisfy everyone's needs,"" says John Abou-Rjeily, a researcher at the company Tiamat Energy, which emerged from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS ) and which designs and manufactures sodium-ion batteries.

As reported in the UE's Horizon magazine, this doctor in Physics and Chemistry of Materials is investigating the possibilities of sodium, one of the most abundant chemical elements in the Earth's crust, and which is safer and cheaper to process than lithium. On the downside, it requires more space, which is why current batteries are not yet suitable for very small devices.

They also cannot compete with the range that current storage systems bring to electric cars, but they could serve as alternatives on shorter routes, which account for the majority of car trips. ""While I would never challenge the 500-kilometer range of lithium-ion batteries, this type of sodium-ion could be more competitive for short and medium distances by car, explains Abou-Rjeily.

Researchers from the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) and Delaware University (United States) are working along the same lines, according to a study published in Energy. ""There is a tendency to demand a really large battery. But according to research, generally, a slightly smaller one, with less range than that of a gasoline tank, is sufficient, since the only time in which you would need a greater autonomy is for a trip of six hours or more, in which case, the driver could charge on the go. There is too much emphasis on the need for a really long range and this leads to an increase in the price of the vehicle and a greater use of resources for electric cars,"" says Frances Sprei, a professor at Chalmers.

For this doctor in Energy and Environment, this change in mentality is necessary to adapt charging facilities where people spend the most time: at home and at work. Sprei regrets that, on the contrary, many European countries focus on the charging network on roads.

This simple modification of the perception of needs would further promote sodium as an alternative, since it would allow the technology to be deployed in homes and workplaces as energy storage systems from renewable sources. This is the goal pursued by Magdalena Graczyk-Zajac, a visiting professor at the Technical University Darmstadt in Germany, and member of the European SIMBA project, a EU-funded initiative to develop a sodium-ion battery for homes which concludes its first phase next June.

This researcher is committed to finding ways to store the energy captured by home photovoltaic panels in a rechargeable sodium ion domestic battery. This would power the homes and charge the electric vehicles of its residents with a significant cost reduction. ""You could be driving your car for free for eight to nine months of the year,"" she says. A prototype is already in laboratory tests.

One part of the battery, the anode, is made from hard carbon, which can be manufactured from wood or biowaste. Another, the cathode, can be made of a material called Prussian white, a chemical compound from a blue pigment of the same name, but with more sodium and rich in iron, one of the most abundant metals.

The Basque research center CIC energiGUNE has its own development in this area: a sodium metal anode with a thickness of only seven microns (70 times thinner than the current ones) achieved through a physical evaporation process. According to this center, the advance opens the door to the manufacture of flexible solid-state batteries with the thin sodium anode, a safer, cheaper and smaller alternative to the current batteries with liquid electrolyte in which graphite is used.

""Sodium cannot be easily laminated due to its sticky texture, similar to plasticine,"" explains Montse GalcerÃ¡n, the principal researcher of this project. ""To date, the most common method used to roll a block of sodium was as basic as processing it with a hammer, but this meant that a thin and homogeneous sheet could not be obtained, and, therefore, there was a large excess of unused sodium in the batteries. Thanks to evaporation, we have managed to overcome that obstacle,"" she says.

This thinning of the anode allows researchers to reduce the amount of sodium needed, as well as the costs, weight and dimensions of the batteries, while increasing energy density (greater storage capacity) and safety.

Another element that is used as a substitute for lithium is calcium. ""It is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust and it is not concentrated in specific geographic areas, as is the case with lithium. If the raw material is cheap, the batteries can also be cheap,"" says Rosa PalacÃ­n, from the Institute of Materials Science of Barcelona (ICMAB-CSIC) and a member of the CARBAT project.

Using calcium as a negative electrode offers advantages over graphite in lithium-ion batteries, since it has a greater accumulation capacity per kilogram (energy density) than conventional lithium batteries, which also form tiny rigid structures called dendrites and can cause short circuits or explode after many uses, according to this institution.

""When calcium passes through the electrolyte, two electrons flow out, instead of one, as in the case of lithium. It can be assumed that a battery of the same size would offer greater autonomy if used in an electric vehicle, as long as a suitable positive electrode is found,"" explains PalacÃ­n.

The key is choosing the most appropriate components. ""It appears that ultimately all working electrolyte salts contain boron. We use calcium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in a mixture of ethylene and propylene carbonate,"" says the researcher.

Other researchers from the Technical University of Denmark are searching, as part of the SALBAGE project, for a battery made from an aluminum anode and a sulfur cathode. Aluminum is even more abundant than calcium, but incorporating it into a battery poses similar difficulties.

""All the materials used are cheap. Aluminum, sulfur, the electrolyte itself and urea are very, very cheap. Even the polymer is,"" says the researcher Juan Lastra, who defends this option to store energy from a wind or solar park.",english.elpais.com,news,EL PAÃS,RaÃºl LimÃ³n,0.1529411764705881,454277955,12,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/3SSHVIOBEEQ7FKJOWQN6LSLCOM.jpg?auth=9d3787c66a540268283208b5d7b8518f1e588837c174c4e97934f16f4f450e4a&width=1200,

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Policymakers are relying on conventional wisdom about the course of the war, the sustainability of Western support, and the circumstances under which the war might end. Some of these are accurate, but many are not. This paper explores ten commonly heard arguments or assumptions about the war in Ukraine and assesses whether or not they are accurate.

Unstated assumptions are often at the core of our foreign policy decisions; whether they realize it or not, policymakers are drawing from implicit beliefs and mental models of how the world works to answer critical questions.Stephen Walt, ""Leaving Theory Behind: Why Simplistic Hypothesis Testing Is Bad for International Relations,"" European Journal of International Relations 19, no. 3 (2013): 427-457. These assumptions can be big and wide-ranging, i.e., whether China is a revisionist power, whether the world is multipolar, or whether democracies fight wars better than autocracies. Many have been subject to academic study by political scientists and historians, though policymakers may not necessarily be aware of this fact.

Nowhere have untested assumptions become more problematic in the last few years than in discussions of the war in Ukraine. Indeed, because the debate on Ukraine has become so politically charged, many of these arguments are themselves increasingly polemical in nature, designed to provoke an emotional response in one direction or the other. Many also contain a kernel of truth, while obscuring important or broader points. Yet understanding which of these assumptions are true, which are false, and which are more nuanced is necessary if we are to understand how the war might develop - or how it might end. This paper examines ten of the most common arguments and assumptions about the war in Ukraine.

This is a question that cannot be answered easily; whether any policy choice is affordable or not depends on your own views about government spending, the national debt, and the priorities of the U.S. government. ""America's Fiscal Future,"" Government Website, U.S. Government Accountability Office, May 8, 2023, https://www.gao.gov/americas-fiscal-future. But here are some concrete facts about the costs of support for Ukraine and how it compares to other spending: In the first two years of the war, Congress appropriated about $175 billion related to the costs of the war in Ukraine, predominantly for arms.Jonathan Masters and Will Merrow, ""How Much U.S. Aid Is Going to Ukraine?,"" Council on Foreign Relations (blog), May 9, 2024, https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine. This amounts to approximately $60 billion dollars per year - if one assumes the most recent supplemental lasts about a year - and is equivalent to about seven percent of the annual U.S. defense budget per year.

Critics would argue that this is a bargain: the ability to attrite the Russian military for less than ten percent of our annual military spending is a great deal. They are undoubtedly right when talking about 2022, and perhaps even 2023. Where this assumption becomes more problematic, though, is in the long run. Spending seven or eight percent of the defense budget per year on Ukraine will add up significantly over time, contributing not just to spending levels, but also - as we learned during the war on terror - ramping up the national debt. This level of cost repeated over five to seven years is far less sustainable than a one-time addition to the defense budget; it's also a cost with diminishing marginal gains.

Opportunity cost is perhaps the most relevant metric here. Depending on where you land on the political spectrum, perhaps you would prefer to spend this money on domestic programs, or on returning money to taxpayers. But even if we were to assume this money would get spent on national security regardless, seven or eight percent of the defense budget per year to Ukraine is a significant opportunity cost for money that could potentially be spent elsewhere on improving U.S. capabilities or readiness. This amount of money could double the budget of the State Department, for example, purchase multiple aircraft carriers, or fund four of the new ballistic missile submarines needed to modernize the nuclear triad. Emily McCabe and Cory Gill, ""Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs: FY2024 Budget and Appropriations"" (Washington D.C.: Congressional Research Service, January 24, 2024), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47579; Mallory Shelbourne, ""Cost Estimates for Lead Boat in Columbia-Class Program Grow by $637M,"" USNI News (blog), June 7, 2021, https://news.usni.org/2021/06/07/cost-estimates-for-lead-boat-in-columbia-class-program-grow-by-637m.

The Biden administration and some of its Republican supporters have been keen to point out that most of the money that the United States is 'sending' to Ukraine remains within the U.S. economy.Marc Thiessen, ""Ukraine Aid's Best-Kept Secret: Most of the Money Stays in the U.S.A.,"" Washington Post, November 29, 2023, https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/29/ukraine-military-aid-american-economy-boost/. The Pentagon spends money primarily with defense contractors to produce weapons which are then sent to Ukraine. In doing so, proponents argue, the spending creates American jobs and strengthens our defense industrial base.C. Todd Lopez, ""Ukraine Security Assistance Strengthens Nation's Defense Industrial Base,"" U.S. Department of Defense, November 29, 2023, https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3601120/ukraine-security-assistance-strengthens-nations-defense-industrial-base/; Elizabeth Hoffman et al., ""How Supporting Ukraine Is Revitalizing the U.S. Defense Industrial Base"" (Washington D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies, April 18, 2024), https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-supporting-ukraine-revitalizing-us-defense-industrial-base. This argument is often combined with the idea that the president's use of his drawdown authority to aid Ukraine - the process through which the United States sends military surplus overseas and backfills with new, more modern equipment - is improving U.S. capabilities as a result of these upgrades.Mackenzie Eaglen, ""Most of the Money in the 'Foreign Aid' Bill Would Stay in the U.S.,"" The Dispatch, February 16, 2024, https://thedispatch.com/article/most-of-the-money-in-the-foreign-aid-bill-would-stay-in-the-u-s/.

There's a kernel of truth to this: much of the money appropriated for weapons will in fact go to U.S. defense contractors to manufacture armaments. However, again, it is worth considering the question of opportunity costs in government spending. Military Keynesianism - spending on weapons and defense to bolster the domestic economy - is one of the least effective means of stimulating economic growth.Jan Toporowski, ""The War in Ukraine and the Revival of Military Keynesianism"" (Institute for New Economic Thinking, January 9, 2023), https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/the-war-in-ukraine-and-the-revival-of-military-keynesianism; Benjamin Zycher, ""Economic Effects of Reductions in Defense Outlays"" (Washington D.C.: Cato Institute, August 8, 2012), https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/economic-effects-reductions-defense-outlays; Heidi Garrett-Peltier, ""War Spending and Lost Opportunities,"" Costs of War Project (Providence, RI: Brown University, March 2019), https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2019/March%202019%20Job%20Opportunity%20Cost%20of%20War.pdf. It's likely that if this money were spent elsewhere, it would create more growth and more jobs than it is for the purpose of supplying arms to Ukraine.

The benefits to the U.S. industrial base and defense stockpiles are also mixed. It is undoubtedly true that earlier in the conflict much of what America was sending - to Ukraine or to European allies as part of swap arrangements - was older equipment, thereby allowing the Pentagon to backfill its own stocks with more modern systems and newer ammunition. But this argument looks weaker going forward. For one thing, it presents clear diminishing returns over time; once equipment has been upgraded, then any future drawdown will simply have to send more expensive, more modern weapons to Ukraine with no backfill benefit. For another, the U.S. defense industrial base lacks the capacity it needs to meet all demands placed upon it; companies have not kept pace with the need for weapons, and in some cases backfilling these systems has been slow and inefficient.William LaPlante, Jamie Morin, and Jennifer Stewart, ""Is the U.S. Military Industrial Base Prepared?""

The Pentagon has struggled in recent months to meet the demand for supplies to Ukraine, Israel, and other uses; this shortage was also behind the decision by the Biden administration to send old, stockpiled cluster munitions to Ukraine back in 2023.Mark F. Cancian, ""Cluster Munitions: What Are They, and Why Is the United States Sending Them to Ukraine?"" (Washington D.C.: Center for Strategic and International Studies, July 10, 2023), https://www.csis.org/analysis/cluster-munitions-what-are-they-and-why-united-states-sending-them-ukraine; Oren Liebermann Bertrand Natasha, ""US Eyes Weapons Stockpiles as Concern Grows about Supporting Both Ukraine and Israel's Wars,"" CNN, October 11, 2023, https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/politics/us-weapons-stockpiles-ukraine-israel/index.html. Under current circumstances, there are concrete tradeoffs created by this capacity shortfall that make it difficult to send Ukraine everything it needs while also supplying other U.S. partners and maintaining U.S. military readiness.Jennifer Kavanagh and Jordan Cohen, ""The True Military Assistance Tradeoff Is Between Israel and Taiwan,"" War on the Rocks, November 21, 2023, https://warontherocks.com/2023/11/the-true-military-assistance-tradeoff-is-between-israel-and-taiwan/; Alex Velez-Green, ""Managing Trade-Offs Between Military Aid for Taiwan and Ukraine"" (Washington D.C.: Heritage Foundation, August 31, 2023), https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/managing-trade-offs-between-military-aid-taiwan-and-ukraine; Michael Poznansky, ""The Ukraine-Taiwan Tradeoff,"" Foreign Affairs, January 5, 2024, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/ukraine-taiwan-tradeoff.

For the first year of the war, it often seemed that European states were not contributing as much - particularly in military aid to Ukraine - as the United States. It is also true that these states were simultaneously bearing the brunt of refugee costs and the energy crisis, both of which were indirect results of the war; though experiencing inflation, the United States has not been impacted as severely by these costs. Yuru Guan, Klaus Hubacek, Yuli Shan, and Jin Yan, ""Russia-Ukraine War Has Nearly Doubled Household Energy Costs Worldwide - New Study,"" (Davos: World Economic Forum, February 20, 2023), https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/02/russia-ukraine-war-energy-costs.; Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Dominic Rohner, ""The Economic Consequences of the War,"" CEPR, May 17, 2024, https://cepr.org/debates/economic-consequences-war. In direct aid, however, it has taken some time for Europe to catch up. Today, Europe and the United States are nearly neck-and-neck in the amount of aid spent on Ukraine.""Ukraine Support Tracker - A Database of Military, Financial and Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine,"" (Berlin: Kiel Institute), https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/. Where the difference emerges is when one looks at total commitments to Ukraine, where Europe leaps ahead in the amount of money pledged to Ukraine in coming years.""Ukraine Support Tracker: Europe Has a Long Way to Go to Replace US Aid - Large Gap between Commitments and Allocations,"" (Berlin: Kiel Institute, February 16, 2024), https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/europe-has-a-long-way-to-go-to-replace-us-aid-large-gap-between-commitments-and-allocations/. Yet this is mostly budgeting chicanery: where the European Union (EU) and some European states can promise future aid over a longer time horizon, the White House cannot preauthorize spending without congressional approval. Comparing future U.S. and European commitments, therefore, is an exercise in comparing apples to oranges, one which has the effect of inflating perceptions of European commitments to Ukraine. About $65 billion of these pledges from Europe, moreover, are loans, not grants, and come with the expectation of future repayment.

Another way in which such perceptions are often inflated is by comparing contributions to Ukraine as a percentage of GDP, a choice which has the effect of catapulting small European states in the Baltics and Scandinavia up the table of contributors.Wilson Beaver, ""Yes, America Is the Biggest Military Donor to Ukraine,"" (Washington D.C.: The Heritage Foundation. February 2024), https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/yes-america-the-biggest-military-donor-ukraine. But though these efforts are laudable, they are still small by absolute standards. These states are also closest to the conflict; it is unsurprising that they would feel compelled to contribute more to Ukraine's defense. These states typically do not have security concerns in other regions and can focus all their spending and efforts in Eastern Europe. Indeed, the data shows that when controlling for distance, U.S. contributions still stand far ahead of the pack, with only Germany, France, and the United Kingdom in the same league.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) does indeed predict that Russia's economy will grow more anemically in coming years as the effects of decoupling from Europe, Western sanctions, and the costs of the war itself begin to bite; IMF economists predict that Russia will move from a period of GDP growth of about three percent this year to as little as one percent in 2025.""Russian Federation and the IMF,"" International Monetary Fund, April 2024. https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/RUS. But the organization has also upgraded estimates of Russian growth several times in the last few years, and it is widely acknowledged that the Russian Central Bank has done an excellent job of managing the fiscal headwinds created by the war and the associated economic turmoil.Huileng Tan, ""Meet the Woman Who Engineered Russia's Wartime Economy and Helped Secure Another Term for Putin,"" Business Insider, April 1, 2024, https://www.businessinsider.com/elvira-nabiullina-russia-central-bank-governor-engineer-wartime-economy-putin-2024-4.

Russia's economic performance in the last few years has belied many predictions of imminent ruin. This is partly because of overoptimistic assessments of what sanctions can achieve; sanctions can be effective at creating economic pain - if not necessarily creating policy change - but are always going to be less effective when targeted at a large, oil-exporting economy like Russia.Agathe Demarais, Backfire: How Sanctions Reshape the World against U.S. Interests, Center on Global Energy Policy Series (New York: Columbia University Press, 2024). Indeed, despite the oil price cap and European transition away from Russian fossil fuels, the Kremlin has been able to find other buyers for its oil and gas and equip a fleet of so-called 'shadow tankers' that are not tied to Western financial markets. Russian oil routinely trades above the $60 price cap.Alan Rappeport, ""Russia's War Machine Revs Up as the West's Plan to Cap Oil Revenues Sputters,"" The New York Times, May 20, 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/business/russia-oil-price-cap-policy.html.

Rather than civilian economic activity, however, the Russian economy is increasingly driven by demands in the military-industrial space. Much of the growth is driven by increased production in sectors such as metals, electronics, or heavy industry. In short, much of the growth is driven by the military-industrial complex, replacing equipment destroyed in Ukraine, or manufacturing ammunition and armaments.""Russian Manufacturing Booms With Economy on War Footing,"" Bloomberg, January 31, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/russian-manufacturing-booms-with-economy-on-war-footing. Other increases in spending come from construction inside occupied areas of Ukraine; military pensions; and payments to veterans and defense industry workers. Though not a model for robust economic growth over the long term, this is undoubtedly sustainable as a means for the Russian state to subsidize demand and employment within the Russian economy.

Another problem is increasing levels of indirect support from China, which is now a major supplier of non-lethal equipment that supports the Russian war effort, including machine tools and microelectronics. Trade between Russia and China more generally is up over sixty percent since the start of the war.Kelly Ng and Yi Ma, ""How Is China Supporting Russia after It Was Sanctioned for Ukraine War?,"" BBC News, May 17, 2024, https://www.bbc.com/news/60571253. Russia is also growing its financial and trade ties with India, Southeast Asia, and the Gulf States. The country has also been effective at sourcing replacements for components and technology restricted by Western export controls.Steven Feldstein and Fiona Brauer, ""Why Russia Has Been So Resilient to Western Export Controls,"" (Washington D.C.: Carnegie Endowment, March 11, 2024), https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls.

Unfortunately for Ukraine and the West, it is increasingly clear that, with sufficient political will, even an anemic level of economic growth can likely sustain the Russian war effort for years to come. Russian leaders clearly understand this dynamic; recent reshuffles in political leadership have placed technocratic elites in charge of the Ministry of Defense, the military-industrial complex, and other vital components of the war effort.Tony Barber, ""Russia and Ukraine: Two Economies at War,""Financial Times, May 18, 2024 , https://www.ft.com/content/6c316feb-4bb2-4e1f-a125-fe4e913e8d51; In short, though it is possible that sanctions or export controls will continue to attrite Russian capabilities over time, they are not likely to prove disastrous for Russia's war effort.

This argument has become more prevalent in recent months, partly due to the congressional fight over the supplemental, as proponents of further aid have sought to emphasize the potential negative repercussions of Russian gains in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelensky has been particularly forward-leaning on this point: he told a CBS news team in March 2024 that if Ukraine falls, then Putin will want ""Kazakhstan, then the Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany.""Charlie D'Agata, Justine Redman, and Steve Berriman, ""Ukraine's Zelenskyy Warns Putin Will Push Russia's War 'Very Quickly' onto NATO Soil If He's Not Stopped,"" CBS News, March 29, 2024, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-zelenskyy-says-putin-will-threaten-nato-quickly-if-not-stopped/. The message is clear: any Russian gains in Ukraine will embolden Putin, who will come for NATO member states next, sparking a broader war.Alila Slisco, ""NATO Will Be Drawn Into War With Russia If Ukraine Loses: Lloyd Austin,"" Newsweek, February 29, 2024, https://www.newsweek.com/nato-will-drawn-war-russia-if-ukraine-loses-lloyd-austin-1874913.; Stuart Lau, ""Mike Pence Warns Putin Will Wage War on NATO If Ukraine Loses,"" POLITICO, April 18, 2024, https://www.politico.eu/article/mike-pence-vladimir-putin-russia-united-states-nato-donald-trump-ukraine/; Patricia Lopez, ""Ukraine Aid Shows MAGA Hasn't Cowed Johnson,"" Bloomberg, April 21, 2024 https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-21/house-approves-ukraine-aid-deal-in-a-win-for-mike-johnson. Americans who make this case often focus on Europe as a whole, either on the economic costs of instability on the continent or embracing George W. Bush's infamous post-9/11 dictum: 'We will fight them over there so we do not have to face them in the United States of America.""George W. Bush, ""President Bush Addresses the 89th Annual National Convention of the American Legion"" (Speech, 89th Annual National Convention of the American Legion, Reno, NV, August 28, 2007), https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/08/20070828-2.html.

Few would dispute that a proxy war - in which Ukraine fights Russia on behalf of the United States - is better than a direct conflict between NATO and Russia; U.S. troops are not dying in Ukraine, and the risks of nuclear escalation remain far lower than they might in the event of direct conflict with Russia. But it does not necessarily follow from this that the logical result of failure in Ukraine would be a Russian attack on NATO. Indeed, something that has been very clear in the last two years is that NATO's Article 5 does appear to have significant deterrent power. Russia has been careful not to cross the line into direct, attributable attacks on NATO territory or troops, even as it has disregarded other norms and rules of international conduct.Jens Stoltenberg, ""Speech by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the Heritage Foundation Followed by Audience Q&A"" (Speech, Washington D.C., January 31, 2024), https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_222258.htm.

Indeed, despite the significant flows of arms and equipment from NATO countries into Ukraine, Russia has taken no steps to interdict them outside of Ukrainian territory. This suggests something important: attacking a NATO member state is a distinct proposition from attacking a non-member state. Even if Russia did have the intention to seize other parts of Eastern Europe, the calculus for starting such a conflict would be very different.

Perhaps the most problematic form of this argument is the notion that Russian victory in Ukraine could destabilize Europe and undermine trade with one of the biggest economic partners of the United States. Europe is indeed a major trade partner for the United States, and stability in Europe remains a substantial strategic interest for the United States. But it is disingenuous to link smaller failures in Ukraine to the fate of Europe as a whole. Two years of war in Ukraine have not destabilized Europe economically, and the focus of EU-U.S. trade tensions is mostly in other areas.""U.S.-EU Trade and Economic Relations,"" Congressional Research Service, June 9. 2023, https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10931. The war itself remains the primary drag on growth.Catherine Gaschka, ""OECD: War in Ukraine to Drag on Global Economy into 2023,"" AP News, September 26, 2022, https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-inflation-health-paris-china-18d11f0a6fccd1ce48f1417993dd3d14. The Cold War example is also instructive: the United States and its European partners held out against the Soviet Union for decades, prospering economically, even when Ukraine was an integral part of the USSR.

Wars are always fundamentally uncertain, and even analysts with significant expertise and knowledge of a conflict often must reassess their priors because of events. This is the phenomenon referred to by Clausewitz as the 'fog of war,' or by management gurus as VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous).Carl von Clausewitz et al., On War, (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1989); Nate Bennett and G. James Lemoine, ""What VUCA Really Means for You,"" Harvard Business Review, January 1, 2014, https://hbr.org/2014/01/what-vuca-really-means-for-you. Predicting the specific turns and twists of a war is therefore often a fool's errand. The fact that a significant number of military analysts expected early Russian military victory in this war, for example, is treated in hindsight as a failure of analysis - but it was largely a reflection of poor assumptions. It was also a reflection of the inability of analysts to predict whether peacetime forces translate into effective fighting power, or to assess the importance of intangible factors like the 'will to fight.'Nomaan Merchant and Matthew Lee, ""U.S. Intelligence Agencies Review What They Got Wrong on Russia's Invasion of Ukraine,"" PBS NewsHour, June 4, 2022, https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/u-s-intelligence-agencies-review-what-they-got-wrong-on-russias-invasion-of-ukraine.

At the same time, we are now two years into this war, which has enabled all parties to gather significant information about how the two parties have sustained and managed their war effort thus far - along with lessons about how new technology is shaping the future of war.Robert Rose, ""Biting Off What It Can Chew: Ukraine Understands Its Attritional Context,"" War on the Rocks, September 26, 2023, https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/biting-off-what-it-can-chew-ukraine-understands-its-attritional-context/; Michael Kofman and Rob Lee, ""Perseverance and Adaptation: Ukraine's Counteroffensive at Three Months,"" War on the Rocks, September 4, 2023, https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/perseverance-and-adaptation-ukraines-counteroffensive-at-three-months/; Dara Massicot, ""What Russia Got Wrong,"" Foreign Affairs, February 8, 2023, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/what-russia-got-wrong-moscow-failures-in-ukraine-dara-massicot; Margarita Konaev and Owen J.

As a result, analysts now have a much better idea of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Ukrainian and Russian militaries and can predict where the plausible outcomes may lie.

In a war of attrition like the one in Ukraine, the most important attributes for a nation are personnel and economic industrial strength. These are the attributes which - if a state is able to turn them into military power - enable combatant states to hold and occupy territory. The war has thus far confirmed this point. Russia has a deep well of manpower, a substantial stockpile of legacy Soviet military equipment to draw upon, and, despite corruption and significant failures, has shown a remarkable ability in the last two years to repurpose its economy towards wartime production.Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, ""Russian Military Objectives and Capacity in Ukraine Through 2024"" (London: RUSI, May 20, 2024), https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-military-objectives-and-capacity-ukraine-through-2024.; Jack Watling, ""In Ukraine, Russia Is Beginning to Compound Advantages,"" May 21, 2024, https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/ukraine-russia-beginning-compound-advantages.; Stephen Feldstein and Fiona Brauer, ""Why Russia Has Been So Resilient to Western Export Controls"" (Washington D.C.: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, March 11, 2024), https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls. It may not be sustainable in the long term, but for the short-to-medium term - potentially a period of several years - Russia has the advantage.Alexandra Prokopenko, (Berlin: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, March 2024), https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/is-the-kremlin-overconfident-about-russias-economic-stability?. Ukraine is a smaller nation, with significantly lower reserves of manpower and a demographic deficit; its entire economy is hostage to Russian strikes. Thus far, Ukraine has compensated for this with inflows of Western weapons and technology. But there are very few remaining areas where technology is likely to provide a significant boost, and Ukraine is facing serious pressure in manpower, where Western support cannot compensate for weakness.Andrew E. Kramer, Josh Holder, and Lauren Leatherby, ""Can Ukraine Find New Soldiers Without Decimating a Whole Generation?"" The New York Times, April 11, 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/11/world/europe/ukraine-demographics.html.; Marc Santora, ""Ukraine's Parliament Passes a Politically Fraught Mobilization Bill,"" The New York Times, April 11, 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-mobilization-bill.html. All of this suggests the grinding war of attrition between Russia and Ukraine is likely to continue, with Ukraine at a disadvantage, but Russia struggling to translate its power into major battlefield gains. The most plausible range of scenarios for the war suggests grinding conflict that moderately advantages Russia, but only in the costly conquest of tiny amounts of territory.

Much of the talk in DC over the last year or so has centered around the idea of security guarantees for Ukraine at the end of the war, with some arguing that if the West does not guarantee Ukraine's security as part of a peace deal, then Russia will be incentivized to attack again, salami-slicing off ever-increasing chunks of Ukraine.Dr. Benjamin Tallis, ""Security Guarantees for Ukraine,"" (Berlin: German Council on Foreign Relations, June 30, 2023), https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/security-guarantees-ukraine-0. This sounds reasonable but has a critical logical flaw: the role of Western credibility. The United States and its European partners have demonstrated since 2022 that they do not intend to fight a direct war with Russia over Ukraine, suggesting that any commitment to do so in the future might be viewed in Moscow merely as a paper promise.Joseph R. Biden Jr, ""President Biden: What America Will and Will Not Do in Ukraine,"" The New York Times, May 31, 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html.

A similar problem exists for promises to admit Ukraine into NATO at some unspecified future date. Indeed, it was this kind of credibility failure that contributed to the start of this conflict in 2014. The commitment by the George W. Bush administration at the 2008 NATO summit - against the advice of many other member states - to admit Georgia and Ukraine to NATO was seen as threatening by the Kremlin. At the same time, Bush's pledge offered no credible path to membership for these states - and thus no deterrent value against Russia, producing multiple wars.Paul Taylor, ""Ukraine: NATO's Original Sin,"" POLITICO, November 23, 2021 https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-nato-georgia-europe-european-union-united-states/. In short, paper promises are problematic. And admitting Ukraine into NATO as a member also carries the risk of undermining the credibility of Article 5 more broadly; if Ukraine is not worth sending American troops to fight and die in 2022 or 2024, why would accession to full NATO membership suddenly change this calculus for a U.S. president?

There is one major exception to the 'security guarantees' argument. A concrete commitment from Western states to arm Ukraine and help it build its own defenses post-war may well be a vital component of any peace settlement. Unlike a promise to directly defend Ukraine, this is a highly credible commitment; it is, after all, what Western states have been doing for the past two years. Committing to arm Ukraine, train its soldiers, and boost its military capabilities would increase Ukraine's own deterrent abilities and reduce the likelihood of future conflict - without the risks posed by offering Ukraine formal security guarantees.

A frequent refrain from policymakers and pundits over the last two years is that a ceasefire or peace settlement in Ukraine is simply impossible.Dr. Jack Watling and Reynolds, ""Russian Military Objectives and Capacity in Ukraine Through 2024."" (London: RUSI, February 13, 2024), https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-military-objectives-and-capacity-ukraine-through-2024. More reasonable versions of these arguments are time-bound, and focus on concrete facts, arguing, for example, that it might be better to delay negotiations until the balance of forces better favors Ukraine. But there are also more extreme versions of this argument, which posit that Russia will never abandon its absolutist goals, or that it is not rational enough to make an agreement.Jamie Dettmer, ""Ukraine Is Ready for a Just Peace -- Not Russia's Version of One,"" POLITICO, May 3, 2024, https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-ukraine-ready-peace-russia-war/.

These arguments are fundamentally at odds with scholarly understandings of how wars end. Indeed, for political scientists, rationalist theories of war portray conflict as part of a bargaining process, or as a continuation of the political process.James D. Fearon, ""Rationalist Explanations for War."" International Organization 49, no. 3 (1995): 379-414, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300033324. Though this may sound faintly ridiculous, it is an effective framework for understanding conflict. States that cannot manage their disagreements through political or economic means sometimes resort to force to do so, and others assume that they will get a better outcome with force than diplomacy. Wars end when both sides have extracted enough information from the conflict about the actual balance of military power - and the probability of achieving their objectives through force - that they are willing to make some kind of settlement. Settlements tend to occur when both states do not perceive significant additional benefits to continuing to fight and are willing to make concessions to avoid further bloodshed.H. E. Goemans, ""War Termination,"" in Oxford Research Encyclopedia of International Studies, 2010, https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.013.41. ; D. Wittman, ""How a War Ends: A Rational Model Approach,"" Journal of Conflict Resolution, 23, no 4 (1979): 743-763. https://doi-org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/10.1177/002200277902300408.

This is easier theorized than put into practice. Today, either Russia or Ukraine may be disincentivized from negotiating if they perceive benefits to continuing the conflict. Worse, it may not be obvious at the time that a window has opened for negotiations; such opportunities often only become apparent in hindsight. One could make a plausible argument, for example, that Ukraine had a stronger negotiating position in the fall of 2022 than it does today. At the time, however, the prospect of future gains increasing Kyiv's leverage at the negotiating table was persuasive - and no ceasefire emerged.

The longer a war continues, however, the more the true balance of forces on the ground is revealed; states should therefore begin to adjust their war aims accordingly. We have seen this process begin to occur in practice in Ukraine. After the first few months of the invasion in 2022, Russia largely shifted away from its most ambitious war aims - seizing all of Ukraine and toppling the government in Kyiv. Since that time, it has instead focused on territorial acquisition in the Donbas, and on grinding down Ukrainian resolve.Victor Andrusiv, ""Putin's War of Vanishing Goals,"" (Washington D.C.: Wilson Center (blog),

https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/putins-war-vanishing-goals.; ""Russia Says It Is Changing Its War Aims in Ukraine,"" The Economist, March 8, 2022, https://www-economist-com/europe/2022/03/28/russia-says-it-is-changing-its-war-aims-in-ukraine. Undoubtedly, the Russians would prefer to return to those earlier war aims, but facts on the ground continue to mitigate against it. Ukrainian war aims, on the other hand, have grown. At the start of the war, it was clear that Kyiv's central goal was to defend its own sovereignty, with policymakers even willing to negotiate on the questions of NATO membership and neutrality in the early months of the war.Samuel Charap and Sergey Radchenko, ""The Talks That Could Have Ended the War in Ukraine,"" Foreign Affairs, April 16, 2024, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/talks-could-have-ended-war-ukraine. Today, Kyiv's policy of territorial reacquisition is more ambitious.

But while Russia and Ukraine's war aims may remain at odds today, they will not always be so; the inability of the parties to find a ceasefire today does not preclude the possibility that they may be able to in the future.

If there has been one constant throughout the last two years, it has been the fixation of Western policymakers on Ukrainian territorial integrity, which manifests in assertions that Ukraine cannot survive or thrive if it doesn't return to its 1991 borders.Benjamin Jensen and Elizabeth Hoffman, ""Victory in Ukraine Starts with Addressing Five Strategic Problems,"" (Washington D.C.: CSIS, May 15, 2024), https://www.csis.org/analysis/victory-ukraine-starts-addressing-five-strategic-problems. Such statements imply a second, unstated assumption: that a return to these borders will inevitably produce a more durable peace settlement. Both these notions once again contradict scholarly understandings of war termination.

Within rationalist models of war, another big obstacle to ending a conflict is what political scientists call indivisible interests. In brief: there are certain issues that may be so important to one side or the other that they are unwilling to compromise, or - perhaps more commonly - there are issues on which one cannot compromise for a variety of reasons. Only one person can be king of a country, for example, and many cities cannot easily be divided in two. Resolving an indivisible issue requires the wisdom of Solomon; one cannot simply 'split the baby.'1 Kings 3:16-28.

Political science literature suggests that indivisibility is perhaps less important than one might assume. But even so, the war in Ukraine features several indivisible issues. Ukraine can either join NATO or remain neutral, for one; it cannot be half-in and half-out of the alliance. Ukraine cannot both embrace a fully Western identity as a state and remain within Russia's sphere of influence. And some of the concessions that Russia has demanded in Ukrainian domestic politics are incompatible with the sovereignty of the Ukrainian state, such as poorly defined Russian demands that Ukraine 'de-nazify' its government.Anton Troianovskim, ""Why Vladimir Putin Invokes Nazis to Justify His Invasion of Ukraine,"" New York Times, March 17, 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/world/europe/ukraine-putin-nazis.html.

But it is important to note that the one thing in this conflict that is not indivisible is territory.Paul R. Hensen and Sara McLaughlin Mitchell. ""Issue Indivisibility and Territorial Claims."" GeoJournal 64, no. 4 (2005): 275-85. http://www.jstor.org/stable/41148009. Indeed, much of what Ukraine and Russia are currently fighting over - at least in territorial terms - is almost irrelevant to big picture questions of Ukraine's economic viability, or its integration into the Euro-Atlantic system. This contrasts strongly with Russia's attempts earlier in the war to seize the port of Odessa, something which would have undermined Ukraine's economic viability.John Hudson and Anastacia Galouchka, ""In Repeat Bombing of Odessa, Putin Deepens Economic War on Ukraine,"" The Washington Post, July 7, 2023, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/29/ukraine-grain-agriculture-russia-attacks/. Whether or not Ukraine takes another twenty miles of territory in the Donbas, however, the conflict's underlying issues will remain unaddressed. This should cause us to question the idea that reclaiming territory is the most effective way to peace.

Rounding out our tour of rationalist explanations of war, we find a third argument against any ceasefire in Ukraine: the problem of credible commitments.Robert Powell, ""War as a Commitment Problem,"" International Organization 60, no. 1 (January 2006): 169-203, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818306060061. The literature on war termination argues that unless the parties to a conflict can be persuaded that a ceasefire deal is credible - and that their opponent will not simply pocket concessions and return to fighting - they will not move towards settlement. Because intentions are impossible to discern from the outside, it's not enough just to trust the promises of the other party in a peace deal; those promises must be believable or enforced in some way.

This is undoubtedly the biggest obstacle to peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. With a decade and a half of mistrust arising from the 2014 invasion, the simmering war in the Donbas, and the failed Minsk peace process, both sides are primed to expect the other party to renege on commitments. And indeed, a ceasefire or freezing of the lines in Ukraine that grants Russia some territorial concessions while failing to address any of the conflict's bigger picture issues might well produce future conflict; either side would have an incentive to build up their forces, break the ceasefire, and push for further territory.

A broader settlement that incorporates outside entities such as the United States, however, might well be more successful. So might a settlement that addresses big questions about Europe's security architecture - and Russia's place in it - going forward. Assurances to Russia about future NATO expansion, or conventional arms control limitations on either side, could help to defuse concerns about future conflict and improve the odds a settlement will succeed.Samuel Charap and Miranda Priebe, ""Avoiding a Long War: U.S. Policy and the Trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"" (Washington D.C.:RAND Corporation, January 25, 2023), https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2510-1.html. Precisely because they are controversial, however, these issues will be significantly harder to reach agreement on.

Finally, it is worth questioning the assumption that a halt in fighting in Ukraine now, followed by a resumption of conflict at a later date, would necessarily disadvantage Kyiv. Both sides would undoubtedly benefit at this point from a pause to permit rearmament and mobilization, but Ukraine might benefit more from the cessation of Russian attacks on its critical infrastructure and cities. Moreover, a cessation of hostilities would favor Ukraine in regard to its manpower deficit; every day where Ukrainian soldiers are not being killed is a win. In short, though the broader problem of a Russian-Ukrainian rematch after ceasefire remains, policymakers should also engage with the hypothetical: are Ukraine's defensive capabilities best improved in wartime or in peace?

Each of these arguments - though commonly heard in debates over U.S. support to Ukraine - are more nuanced and challenging than commonly assumed. Indeed, each of the arguments explored in this paper represents one or more implicit assumptions. Though policymakers may rely on these suppositions, they rarely examine them, or think through their implications. Adding nuance to them - and attempting to ascertain the extent to which these are true or false - is thus a vital part of an informed debate about the role of the United States and Europe in the war in Ukraine. Also notable is the fact that none of these ten assumptions answers the question of whether and to what extent Ukraine matters to U.S. interests and the resources it is willing to commit to the conflict. Arguments about the difficulties of finding a settlement, about Ukrainian membership in NATO, or even about Ukraine's battlefield prospects do little to help us understand what U.S. interests in the conflict are and the limits of those interests. This is why it is so important to frame the Ukraine debate not as an all-or-nothing proposition, but as a question about the scope of U.S. involvement, the scope of U.S. interests, and how we find a strategy that marries the first to the second.",stimson.org,news,Stimson Center,Joaquin Matamis,-0.388235294117647,454179837,5,https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tank-in-Grass.jpg,

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness.

Slogan at the fair stand: Beyond Performance - 50 Years of Porsche Turbo

Turbo talk with Monegasque racing driver StÃ©phane Ortelli followed by an autograph session

25 - 28 April 2024 / Hall 1 Stand A74

A visit to Porsche at the Retro Classics in Stuttgart is always a journey through time. This year, the sports car manufacturer will be celebrating its anniversary 'Beyond Performance - 50 Years of Porsche Turbo' at the trade fair for classic car fans and sports car enthusiasts, presenting impressive exhibits from 25 to 28 April 2024.

Retro Classics brings throngs of classic-car and sports-car enthusiasts from all around the world to Stuttgart. For Porsche, the trade fair is not just a home game, but a fixture in its annual event calendar. From Thursday to Sunday, 25 to 28 April 2024, the sports car manufacturer will showcase an extraordinary selection of exhibits there.

""This year we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Turbo at the Retro Classics. No other model reflects the company's innovative drive as strikingly as the Turbo derivatives,"" said Achim Stejskal, Director of Porsche Heritage and Museum.

In 1974, the sports car manufacturer presented the first series 911 Turbo at the Paris Motor Show. A technology that migrated from motorsport to series production in characteristic Porsche fashion.

""We are delighted to be able to show visitors vehicles that were always ahead of their time.""

On Saturday, April 27th at 2 pm, Thomas Krickelberg, Project Manager in the 911/718 model line at Porsche and Frank Jung, Head of the Company Archive, will talk to the Monegasque racing driver and Le Mans winner StÃ©phane Ortelli about the Turbo. Afterwards, Ortelli, who won the 24-hour race for Porsche in the Porsche 911 GT1 in 1998 together with teammates Laurent AÃ¯ello and Allan McNish, will be available for autograph requests. In addition to the Turbo Talk, visitors to the fair stand can also take part in guided tours on the topic of 50 years of Turbo.

At Stand A74 in Hall 1, the company will be showing the first 911 Turbo -- the one which saw Porsche usher in a new era. The first of its kind, the model exhibited is also a one-off, namely the Porsche 911 Turbo 'No. 1', which Louise PiÃ«ch received for her 70th birthday in the summer of 1974. In contrast to the Turbo models offered by the manufacturer from the spring of 1975 on, PiÃ«ch's gift has the narrow body of the 911 Carrera. The bonnet of the 176 kW (240 PS) sports car bears the ""Carrera"" logo instead of the 'Turbo' logo. In order to see the picturesque mountain landscapes of Austria in true-to-life colours, the daughter of Ferdinand Porsche refrained from tinting the windscreen. A badge on the glove compartment bears the initials LP and the inscription: Turbo-Porsche No. 1, Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, 29 Aug. 1974.

The next gem at the stand is a 911 Turbo 3.0 CoupÃ© from 1975. This Porsche in Silver Green Diamond was one of the first 30 Turbos to be completed within series production. The mirrors matched those of the Carrera and were painted in the exterior colour, while the wider wings were welded to the body by hand.

Another crowd-puller at the over 500-square-metre stand is a 911 GT2 with wing extensions and additional air intakes. In order to provide the Turbo engine with sufficient air, the adjustable rear wing had lateral openings. The equipment in the sports car from 1996 was spartan, ensuring that not a single extraneous gram was on board. The doors and bonnet were made of aluminium, rear and side windows were made of thin glass, and the manufacturer dispensed entirely with insulating material. The biturbo engine had 20 PS more power than the standard version.

Also on show at the fair is the 911 GT1 '98, a lightweight racer that tips the scales at just 970 kilograms. Unlike its predecessor with a sheet steel front end, the mid-engine sports car featured a carbon-fibre monocoque and a plastic outer shell. The water-cooled 3.2-litre, six-cylinder engine with two turbochargers generated around 404 kW (550 PS). Thanks to groundbreaking engine electronics, fuel consumption was very low, a decisive advantage when racing at Le Mans. This model served as a test vehicle throughout its entire career, and later as a stand-in for photo shoots.

The 911 Turbo S was one of only 435 models built by Porsche Exclusive. With 331 kW (450 PS), the air-cooled biturbo boxer engine was one of the most powerful of the 911 generation 993. The chassis of the sports car was lowered by 15 millimetres, and the body featured an aero package with front and rear spoilers. The four exhaust tailpipes were particularly striking. Visitors to the trade fair who take a look inside will see almost all plastic parts covered with leather.

There's a special story behind the latest Turbo model at the stand. The 911 Turbo S 'Duet' from 2020 is the product of a cooperation between Porsche and the aircraft manufacturer Embraer. Those who opted for the Phenom 300E business jet at the time could purchase a customised 911 Turbo S in a silver two-tone finish. In many of its details, the 650 PS sports car is reminiscent of aviation. For example, the side air intakes and trims on the side windows in brilliant chrome evoke the appearance of jet engines. The individual registration of the associated jet can be found on the underside of the rear wing as well as on the vehicle key of the model, which was produced in a limited run of ten units. In a nod to the wording on aircraft wings, the panels of the door sills in the doors bear the words 'No step'.

In addition to exciting vehicles from the Turbo era, Porsche will also be presenting two engine exhibits. While one engine from 1988 represents the second generation of the Turbo, the other comes from the seventh generation. Between the two models of the 911 Turbo - the first was called 930 in-house, the second 991 - was a span of 26 years and 220 PS. In a display case at the stand, Porsche will be showing a number of exhibits from the archive, such as the drawing of the Turbo logo from 1974, advertisements, and the equipment card of the first Turbo. The museum shop, which is integrated into the trade fair stand, offers visitors selected products related to Porsche as well as a collection specially created for the Turbo anniversary.

Crowning glory of a proven concept

For the public, the story of the Porsche 911 Turbo began on 13 September 1973 at the International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt. On that fateful Thursday, a silver 911 stood atop a round presentation podium bedecked in red. Upholstered in blue-black artificial leather, the seat centre panel featured the 'Black Watch' tartan pattern in blue-green. The 911 RSR Turbo concept car resembled a 911 Carrera RS 3.0, but for the large lettering on the rear wings of the prototype, which added the critical indication that a new model was in the offing. The word 'Turbo' heralded the forthcoming top-of-the-line version of the 911.

Almost a whole year would go by before the first 911 Turbo changed hands as a unique gift. It was none other than Ferry Porsche who gave the sports car, on behalf of all Porsche employees, to his sister Louise PiÃ«ch on 29 August 1974 to mark her 70th birthday. It was a very special one-off. On the rear it says 'Carrera' instead of 'Turbo', which distinguishes this special sports car from the following production vehicles - but the sweeping rear wing indicates that this is a very special model indeed. It is powered by a turbocharged test version of a 2.7-litre engine. Silver on the outside, upholstered with brick-red cowhide leather on the inside, the seat centre panel in a red-blue 'McLaughlin' tartan pattern. The car was equipped with the same anniversary package that also featured in the special model marking '25 years of driving in its most beautiful form'. This narrow-body 911 Turbo 2.7 CoupÃ© without what would become the typical Turbo widening would remain a one-off. It would go down in the history of the brand as the 911 Turbo 'No. 1'.

Porsche unveiled the series production version with a 3.0-litre engine on 3 October 1974 at the Paris Motor Show. Painted in Viper Green Diamond, inside it featured black leather and tartan seat centre panels. Although the first Turbo prototype had been shown the year before - at the outset of the oil crisis - customers were by no means deterred. In the spring of 1975, the Turbo was launched globally as the flagship of the 911 series - and it sold better than expected.

One of the fastest of its time

In the advertisement for the market launch in 1974, Porsche described the 911 Turbo as the ""crowning glory of a proven concept"". Fast-forward half a century and the words still ring true. Just like the subtitle: ""This car combines performance with luxury in perfect harmony. Its superior technology and practical comfort leave nothing to be desired."" The 911 Turbo went down in history as the world's first series-production sports car with an exhaust-gas-controlled turbocharger. And one of the fastest cars of its time. What set it apart from its competitors was its unrestricted day-to-day usability in combination with its luxurious interior equipment. In the press release from September 1974, Porsche also emphasised the ""refined power"" and ""exclusive sportiness"" of the 191 kW (260 PS) sports car.

Initially only planned for a small production run, the model that was internally named 930 would become a Porsche stalwart over the coming five decades. To date, there have been eight generations of the 911 Turbo. Porsche has crowned the company's model range with the name 'Turbo' since 1974. And the 'Turbo' recipe for success has not changed in all that time: the constant technical evolution of a timeless classic.

The Turbo principle has marked the frontier of what is feasible at Porsche for half a century. Turbo is far more than just a model designation. A Turbo from Zuffenhausen combines experience and success, sportiness and day-to-day usability. Every Turbo carries within it all the victories that Porsche has celebrated on the race tracks of the world.

A Turbo from Zuffenhausen. The mere thought of it is enthralling for many. A captivating vision of the ultimate connection between the driver and the road. The very embodiment of a sports car. Turbo stands for an intense driving experience, for sportiness paired with day-to-day usability, for experience and success. A Turbo always represents the limit of what is feasible. As the Turbo dynamically connects one with the road, the driver feels connected with it in turn. Turbo means a history that goes back 50 years to its roots - with origins in motorsports more than 50 years. Turbo as a technology platform. A Turbo is a sports car with uncompromising capability.

Even without mentioning Porsche, the word 'turbo' is inextricably associated with the sports car manufacturer for many automotive enthusiasts. It symbolises many things, not just the crowning glory of the eight 911 generations. Turbo is an integral part of the name of all models: 924 Turbo, 944 Turbo, Cayenne Turbo, Panamera Turbo and Macan Turbo. 'Turbo' embodies the name of a technology, 'Turbo-look' styling, turbocharging as a means of forced induction and, in the case of the Taycan Turbo, even a standalone brand name. In fact, the use of the 'Turbo' moniker in the all-electric Taycan shows that these five letters are no longer tied to the use of a physical exhaust turbocharger. On the contrary: almost all Porsche models today have exhaust turbochargers. But only the pioneering technological models are allowed to adorn themselves with the name 'Turbo'.

It is a tradition at Porsche to crown an existing model range with a Turbo variant. And it's a tradition at Porsche to be visionary. In the midst of the energy crisis in the early 1970s, Porsche was planning for the future - and was well ahead of its time in terms of technological progress. To this day, the sports car manufacturer has retained the idea of first testing new technology, such as the use of an exhaust turbocharger, on the race tracks of the world before they enter series production. Motorsport has always been firmly anchored in the brand's DNA. Porsche tests its mettle against the competition on the track, where lap times are measured and where the driver and the machine face the challenges of a race head-on. Porsche then compresses the knowledge from motorsport to its essence and incorporates it into its next sports car.

The difference between a Turbo and a non-Turbo is not just something you can see - more than anything, it's something you feel. At its market launch, the 911 Turbo was one of the fastest production vehicles of its time and the world's first with an exhaust-gas-controlled turbocharger. In contrast to its competitors, it was fully suitable for everyday use and offered plenty of comfort. It combined performance and luxury. The Turbo always fulfilled Ferry Porsche's desire for high engine performance coupled with efficient use of power. Constant technical evolution has always been the most important secret of success for any Turbo model from Zuffenhausen. The one that brings it closer to the ideal of a sports car than any before it.

With the title 'Beyond performance - 50 years of Porsche Turbo', Porsche unlocks a cosmos full of inspiring stories of triumph and perseverance in the face of challenge. It's never just about the pure power of a Turbo, but much more about the 'feel of Turbo'. The feeling of being able to exceed expectations at any time, but not having to prove yourself to anyone. To the feeling of always going beyond the ordinary. The feeling of 'more'.

The name Turbo in the Porsche family

Half a century ago, Porsche introduced the Turbo model designation for the flagship 911 series. Since then, the 'Turbo' designation has become synonymous with the range-topping Porsche models, and is no longer solely linked to the 911. Since the 1990s, motorsport-inspired series production cars have been even more track-focused, while the Turbo continues to combine uncompromising sportiness and everyday usability. A Turbo unites driving dynamics with efficiency and tradition with innovation, and represents the technological pinnacle in all Porsche model lines.

Mix of experience and success: from the Turbo look to turbocharging

In addition to being the crowning glory of eight 911 generations and the embodiment of a technology, the term 'Turbo' also denotes the particular 'Turbo look' and turbocharging in general. Even before the 911 Carrera was offered with a 'Turbo look' in autumn 1983, Porsche engineers built a 911 Carrera Cabriolet 'Turbo look' in Silver Rose Metallic as a pre-production car for then-CEO Peter W. Schutz. The vehicle's specification included not only the wide body and spoiler of the 911 Turbo, but also its suspension and the four-piston fixed-calliper brakes. Between 1983 and 1993, Porsche created wide-body 'Turbo-look' versions of the G-Series and 964 generations. The following models were available in 'Turbo-look' versions: 911 Carrera 3.2 CoupÃ© (1983 to 1989), 911 Carrera 3.2 Targa and Cabriolet (1984 to 1989), 911 Carrera Speedster (1988 to 1989), 911 Carrera 2 Cabriolet (1992 to 1993), 911 Carrera 2 Speedster (1993) and the anniversary edition 911 Carrera 4 CoupÃ© '30 years of the 911' (1993).

In 1995, Porsche launched the first 911 GT2. This track-focused GT car was based on the 911 Turbo of the 993 generation and featured an air-cooled 3.6-litre twin-turbo flat-six. In the years that followed, Porsche would also use turbocharging in the 911 GT2 of the 997 generations. As part of the new generation of engines, twin turbocharging was introduced in the broader 911 Carrera range from 2015. From 2016, Porsche also used turbocharging in the four-cylinder boxer engines of the 718 model series. The result: greater power and torque combined with lower fuel consumption.

Turbo as a synonym for pioneering achievements in all model lines

'Turbo' has also long been an integral part of the name in other Porsche model lines. It first adorned the Porsche 924 Turbo in 1979, the Porsche 944 Turbo in 1985 and the first 944 Turbo S three years later. The Cayenne Turbo was launched in 2002, and the even more powerful Turbo S in 2005. Porsche launched the Panamera range in 2009, and the first Turbo appeared the same year. Four years later came the top Turbo S variant. Finally, Porsche released the Macan Turbo in 2014.

Five years ago, the 'Turbo' moniker appeared for the first time on the Taycan Turbo. The first models in the new series, the Taycan Turbo S and Taycan Turbo, were the spearhead of Porsche E-Performance. The all-electric sports car was thus poised to continue the story of the Turbo model name - albeit this time without an actual exhaust turbocharger - with the most powerful series production models that the sports car manufacturer had in its product portfolio at the time.

Typical Turbo

What do Porsche enthusiasts think of when they hear the word 'Turbo'? Extravagant rear wings and wheelarches, lightweight construction, air vents between doors and rear wheels, and particularly sporty equipment. They think of special editions, dynamic performance, dramatic power delivery and speed. In addition, a Turbo always combines a wealth of innovations: In the second generation of the 911Turbo, Porsche positioned a charge-air cooler below the rear spoiler. This was a world first in a production car, and again an innovation derived from motor racing. Porsche presented the 996-generation 911 Turbo with PCCB ceramic composite disc brakes. The 911 Turbo (997) was the first series-produced petrol engine to employ turbochargers with Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG). Another characteristic feature of the Turbo is that the sports car manufacturer puts together a new Sport Chrono package for each model. With each new Turbo, Porsche ventures ever closer to the limits of what is possible. Comfortable and suitable for everyday use - that's typical Turbo as well.

Winning streaks, record laps, moments of alarm, and three whiskys - everyone who has experienced Porsche turbo technology has their own very personal story. Here, renowned racing drivers and engineers tell us what 'Turbo' means to them.

Walter RÃ¶hrl

The two-time World Rally champion, development driver and brand ambassador on his own personal turbo journey.

Superior

I first drove the 911 Turbo 3.0 in 1978. The handling of the car presented a challenge, but I was impressed by its power - so in 1979, I bought a 911 Turbo 3.3. I associate Porsche turbo technology in motorsport with power, success - and good friendship. The year 1981 was intense. Driving a 935 with irrepressible rear-wheel-drive power in the wet at Silverstone was a real balancing act. At Le Mans, we completed the distance very well in a 944 prototype. Friends of mine at Porsche built me a 924 Carrera GTS for the German Rally Championship, in which we celebrated four overall victories. Four years later, we carried on in the 911 Turbo S Le Mans GT. 500 PS in a car weighing 1,000 kilograms and without any downforce to speak of - that was quite the adventure.

Today, the 992-generation 911 Turbo is the best car in the world for me. The Turbo is effortless; incredibly powerful and quiet over long distances. I often get fuel consumption of nine litres per 100 km with this Porsche. High performance and incredible comfort: the original idea for the Turbo is alive and well. More so than ever before if you ask me.

Peter Falk

Head of the testing department during the era of the first 911 Turbo, and later head of motorsport behind the success of the Group C 956/962, the TAG-Turbo 'made by Porsche', and the 959 Paris-Dakar.

Those 'Wow!' moments

The 911 Turbo was developed in an era that actually ought to have heralded the end of the 911. I think it helped that our incoming Chairman of the Executive Board, Dr Ernst Fuhrmann, had witnessed the success of the newly turbocharged 917 Spyder in America. Making the 911 Turbo drivable for skilled everyday drivers was an enjoyable challenge, although there were initially a few hairy moments for us, as the chassis was somewhat overwhelmed by the power and weight of the car. Our test cars were capable of almost 300 km/h.

The decision-making processes at that time would be inconceivable today. For example, in spring 1977 I was able to convince Dr Fuhrmann to use the brake system derived from the 917 racing car in the roadgoing 911 Turbo 3.3. Fuhrmann was initially not a fan of this idea, saying: ""Why brake at all? We want people to drive."" After three whiskys we finally got his approval. Our conversation took place at the launch of the 928, at a bar in the south of France.

Valentin SchÃ¤ffer

Head of racing engines from 1964 to 1991, he was instrumental in developing the turbo engines for motorsport and is known to this day as the'Turbo Wizard'. Here SchÃ¤ffer recalls the winning engine from the Group C 956/962.

From America to Le Mans

The decision to enter Le Mans in 1981 came very late. As a result, we needed an engine that was capable of winning - and fast. I proposed the 2.65-litre flat-six to our Executive Board member for development, Helmuth Bott - the engine I had made for a now-cancelled US project. For Le Mans I had to remodel the engine from a single turbo to a twin-turbo configuration, and from running on methanol to running on petrol. Bott was sceptical: ""Will you manage this in time?"" I replied: ""I have to."" We won Le Mans.

The rules for 1982 cut permitted fuel consumption levels drastically. We reduced the boost pressure from 1.2 to 1.0 bar, leaving ourselves with around 580 PS. It was still enough to take the first three positions in the race. In 1983, to further reduce the fuel consumption we replaced the mechanical Kugelfischer injection with the Bosch Motronic 1.2 and achieved a very drivable 640 PS. In practice for Le Mans 1985, we used the entirely water-cooled 3.0-litre twin-turbo for the first time, which delivered 650 PS in racing trim. With this later descendent of the original US engine, we won in both 1986 and 1987. I was retired by the time the engine took one more victory in 1994.

Beginning, highlights and history

I started as a works driver in 2002 and had my first Turbo experience in 2003. I entered the 24-hour race on the Nordschleife in a 996-generation 911 Turbo run by Manthey Racing. The engine had well over 600 PS and driving this car was really wild. We came third, and I'll never forget what it was like driving this 911 on the Nordschleife. The 919 Hybrid - and its high-tech combination of an electric motor plus a V4 turbo petrol engine - was our winning car at Le Mans in 2017, and we won two World Endurance Championships with it. In 2018, I drove the most extreme lap of my life on the Nordschleife with the Evo version of the 919 Hybrid, which delivered more than 1,000 PS. My time was 5:19.55 minutes, with an average speed of 233.8 km/h, and a top speed 369 km/h. These days, I sometimes take racing cars from the Porsche Museum out for a drive to experience at first hand how the turbo engine developed. In the brutal 917/30 Spyder or the 935/78 'Moby Dick', the turbo feels like a power switch. The Group C 962, meanwhile, is incredibly powerful, but more drivable. The beginning, my highlights, and delving into history - all this is what 'turbo' means to me.

As a partner in Californian company Andial and a motorsport specialist, one of the main protagonists in many of the Porsche racing successes in America. President of Porsche Motorsport North America from 1990 to the end of 2003.

Thank you, 911 Turbo!

In January 1990, I became head of Porsche Motorsport North America (PMNA). They were interesting times. The economy had stalled and, after legendary success, our 962 was retired from racing. There was no sign of a new Porsche racing prototype that could win, with Weissach focusing on the Indy and a Formula One engine. Bob Carlson, the Porsche press representative in America, and I came up with an idea: 1991 was going to be the year of the IMSA Supercar Championship for near-series sports cars, with a lot of interest from manufacturers. Our 964-generation 911 Turbo could have been tailor-made for this series, and this particular Turbo was not selling well at the time. So we entered the Supercar series. Weissach was on board, sending two 911 cars for PMNA to fine-tune for racing. We won the championship in 1991 with our very popular drivers Hans-Joachim 'Strietzel' Stuck and Hurley Haywood. Sales of the 911 Turbo picked up again and PMNA was back on the podium. Customer sport began to thrive and we started on a new, successful course: Gran Turismo Sport. Thank you, 911 Turbo!

Practically unbeatable

Down through the years, 'turbo' was a hot topic. During a comparative test, I was in the 1,000 PS 917/10 Spyder from 1972 and JÃ¼rgen Barth was driving a 936 Spyder from 1976 with just 540 PS, with the two cars weighing about the same. On command, we each floored the accelerator in third gear. The 936 was already 100 metres ahead when the power in my car suddenly made the rear wheels spin. In the early 1980s, the development of the Group C 962 suggested to me that state-of-the-art electronics were vastly improving the power delivery. Soon afterwards came our TAG-Turbo for Formula One. With a steady 720 PS from 1.5 litres of displacement, I found the responsiveness to be almost on a par with that of a naturally aspirated engine. However, the sequential turbocharger of the 959 for the 1986 Paris-Dakar Rally was the crowning glory. A small turbo was activated at lower engine speeds, with a second turbo added at higher speeds, enabling sensitive application over loose ground. These days, 'turbo' is practically unbeatable. Unless, that is, you're talking about nostalgia, engine sound and silky-smooth drivability for us old track warriors.

Hans-Joachim Stuck

Ex-Formula One driver, two-time Le Mans winner and World Endurance Champion with Porsche and turbo power.

The Turbo shaped my life

I was in my mid-20s, a Formula One driver dreaming of a Porsche 911 Turbo. I got really lucky, bought a fantastic black car on the cheap, and every drive thereafter was an experience. There had never been anything like it on the road. But back then, in the mid-1970s, the 911 Turbo was a wild beast without any electronic modifications as yet. In particular when it was raining you had to watch out - the performance boost from the big single turbocharger is eye-opening even today. At any rate, I drove my Turbo to a number of Formula One races, and there were many covetous looks at my 300 PS beauty from my fellow drivers. I mostly associate the Group C Porsche 962 with turbo in motorsport, as this is the best racing car I ever drove. We had up to 700 PS powering the rear wheels, and in 1985 my team-mate Derek Bell and I won the World Endurance Championship, while Derek, Al Holbert and I won Le Mans in 1986 and 1987 with the Porsche works team. All in all, turbo pretty much shaped my life.

Hurley Haywood

America's most successful endurance racing driver won the 24 Hours of Daytona five times and Le Mans three times with Porsche.

Like a game of chess

After we won Le Mans in 1977, Dr Porsche put a 911 Turbo at my disposal. During our first drive on a country road, my fellow racing driver Peter Gregg and I were so blown away that we couldn't stop laughing at the incredible power of this car. From the second half of the 1970s onwards, I drove Porsche racing cars with turbo engines. During this time we had to adapt our driving style to the turbo. Rule number one was to keep the charger in line with the engine speed. So, you would brake hard going into a bend while also accelerating - a crazy driving style, really. We also modified our racing tactics accordingly. It was almost like a game of chess. You looked far ahead and plotted a route for getting through the traffic without losing engine speed and then having to wait a long time for your horsepower to build up again. Some people mastered this, others never got the hang of it. The 'turbo moment of silence' is now relegated to history, with Porsche turbo engines delivering power just as spontaneously as only naturally aspirated engines could in the past.

While holding a stopwatch

Timo Bernhard, Brendon Hartley and I won the World Endurance Championship in 2015 with the 919 Hybrid - the combustion engine part of our car was a V4 turbo. So, my memories of the turbo couldn't be better. Ever since I drove a 911 Turbo on the road I've always had one in my garage. The heart of the Porsche sports car is in motorsport. It feels as though the 911 Turbo was also developed while holding a stopwatch. Sheer power, all-wheel drive, variable aerodynamics. The turbo is the point of the spear, and with this car Porsche keeps pushing the supposed limits of what can be done. Since the first 911 Turbo from 1974, Porsche has maintained the tradition of combining the highest levels of performance with excellent comfort in this car.

Turbo with a twist: for young people, for kids and for connoisseurs

Since Porsche presented the first 911 Turbo in 1974, the word Turbo has developed its own unique appeal. The Turbo logo can now be found emblazoned on the flagship models from Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, Leipzig and Bratislava, regardless of the powertrain type - all-electric, plug-in hybrid or petrol engine. When it's connected with Porsche, 'Turbo' is an exuberantly positive synonym for the joys of extraordinary performance, for pioneering innovation - and at times even for the sweeter things in life ...

Turbo for Talents: comprehensive education with extra power

'Turbo' stands for extra power in youth sports, too. The Porsche youth development programme, Turbo for Talents, is currently working with eight partner clubs: RB Leipzig, Stuttgarter Kickers, RB FuÃball Akademie, Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach, VfB Stuttgart, FC Erzgebirge Aue, Bietigheim Steelers and the Ludwigsburg Porsche Basketball Academy (PBA). In addition to the best possible athletic training, up-and-coming football, basketball and ice hockey talents receive full support off the field of play. Cultural and social differences are transcended by sport and the young people involved develop self-confidence and perseverance. The programme teaches values such as team spirit, fairness, respect and passion. Turbo for Talents also pursues the objective of further developing the environmental and social dimension of education. The curriculum therefore encompasses inclusion, sustainable nutrition, health and responsible use of resources. With its Turbo Award, Porsche annually honours the best sporting development and academic performance.

Tina Turbo: the joy of technology and innovation

The Porsche Museum in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen regularly hosts appealing events for children The very young Porsche fans go on exciting museum tours, in the holiday programmes with the support of the walking acts Tom Targa and Tina Turbo, and learn surprising facts about Porsche. While Tom Targa wants to build a sports car for a big race, development engineer Tina Turbo enlists the kids' help to pack her creative suitcase. There are search tasks to complete, puzzles to solve, fun experiments to try and plenty of things to learn. On both tours the participating children discover plenty about Porsche motorsport and technical innovations.

Turbee: the power of nature

Since 2017, 50 bee colonies have been working at the natural off-road grounds in Leipzig with turbo-like efficiency. From the pollen of acacia, lime and blackberries, around three million bees produce up to 1.5 tonnes of spring blossom honey, which gourmets can purchase under the name Turbienchen. Since the summer of 2020, Turbienchen honey has also been produced in a factory-owned orchard near Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, and is available in the Porsche Museum shop and other outlets.",timesofoman.com,news,Times of Oman,http,0.3411764705882352,454234014,1,https://shabiba.eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/2024/05/1716537647-1716537647-bfdrwbbv3jgt.jpg,

Blinken opened a short visit to Eastern Europe with a stop in Chisinau, Moldova's capital, where he announced the assistance at a news conference with President Maia Sandu. America's top diplomat said $85 million would go to bolster energy infrastructure and $50 million was aimed at overhauling the energy and farming industries and deterring disinformation.

""That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldovans to resist Russian interference, to hold free and fair elections, to continue down the path to the European Union and Western integration, to create more economic opportunity,"" Blinken said. ""One of the other things that's so important is sharing information about disinformation and misinformation, which is one of the most potent hybrid tools that Russia uses - and that's something that we are doing.""

He planned to travel to the Czech Republic later.

Before Wednesday, the U.S. had provided Moldova with $774 million in financial aid since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. Some $300 million of that was earmarked for energy security.

Moldova, with about 2.5 million people, used to be entirely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. It faced an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies in the winter of 2022. Moldova's energy woes worsened that year after it suffered temporary blackouts because its Soviet-era energy systems remained connected with Ukraine's, which were being hit hard by Russia's military.

Meantime, Transnistria, a Moscow-backed, disputed territory of Moldova with a key power plant and where Russia bases about 1,500 troops as peacekeepers, cut electricity to other parts of Moldova. Moldovan officials responded by pushing to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

On Wednesday, Sandu thanked the U.S. for its financial support, which she said has helped Moldova broaden its energy sources and bolster its economy. ""We managed to strengthen our energy security from a total dependence on the Russian power resources,"" she said. ""Today, we source natural gas from several sources including the ones of the United States.""

""Thanks to the financial American assistance of $80 million, in the past winter we managed to compensate the energy bills of our citizens,"" she added.

Blinken's trip, organized around a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Prague, the Czech capital, comes amid concerns that Moldova and Georgia, another former Soviet republic, are facing renewed threats from Russia.

Blinken visited Ukraine two weeks ago to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support in the face of increased Russian attacks in its north.

There are also signs Russia may be considering new actions in Moldova and is behind anti-Western moves in Georgia that the U.S. believes run counter to Moldovan and Georgian aspirations to join the European Union.

Both countries have candidate status to eventually join the 27-nation EU bloc.

""There's not a direct military threat that we see at this time, but there's ongoing Russian influence operations, and that is of concern,"" the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, James O'Brien, said last week.

Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU.

""Russia is trying to undermine Moldova, undermine its democratic institutions, undermine its ability to make decisions about its own future using a whole variety of hybrid means,"" Blinken said. ""I think Moldova has done a remarkable job in countering many of those attacks.""

Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow's intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for ""protection"" due to what they said was increased pressure from Chisinau.

In Georgia, those fears intensified on Tuesday when the country's parliament overrode a presidential veto of a ""foreign agents"" bill that has prompted weeks of massive protests by critics who say it will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.

The bill that was approved by the parliament earlier this month requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.

The legislature, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party, dismissed the veto of President Salome Zourabichvili, an independent. The president now has five days to endorse the bill. If she doesn't do so, the parliament speaker will sign it into law.

Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, vetoed the bill on May 18. She has accused the governing party of jeopardizing the country's future and ""hindering the path toward becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.""

Blinken last week announced that the U.S. would impose travel bans on Georgian officials ""who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.""

Blinken's announcement did not identify anyone who has already been targeted, but it said the U.S. would also undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.-Georgia cooperation.

""It remains our hope that Georgia's leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation's democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" he said. ""As we review the relationship between our two countries, we will take into account Georgia's actions in deciding our own.""

The situations in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine will all be on the agenda at the NATO ministerial meeting in Prague on Thursday and Friday It will be the alliance's last major diplomatic get-together before leaders meet at a summit to celebrate NATO's 80th anniversary in Washington in July.

Scarborough council to vote on measures stemming from complaints about cannabis facility odors filed under: russia, ukraine Related Stories Latest Articles",pressherald.com,news,Portland Press Herald,Matthew Lee,0.2784313725490195,454700598,13,https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/Moldova_U.S._Blinken_42217_015e66-1717004488.jpg,eng-9606307
8126644773,eng,False,2024-05-14,09:33:53,2024-05-14T09:33:53Z,2024-05-14T09:24:52Z,news,0.0,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/05/mil-240513-rferl02.htm,Wider Europe Briefing: The EU's Latest Attempt To Hit Russia (And Belarus) With Sanctions,"What You Need to Know: On May 8, the European Commission presented a new round of sanctions on Russia and Belarus to the ambassadors of the European Union member states. The proposal, seen by RFE/RL, is actually surprisingly ambitious, given that the bloc has adopted numerous rather weak packages in the past. The big question is whether the measures, if adopted, will retain their clout. As they have to be adopted unanimously, there is a risk of them being watered down.

Surprisingly, the proposed measures touch on Russian energy, something that has been a ""no-go"" ever since the EU managed to impose a near-ban on Russian oil imports in 2022 after months of diplomatic bickering. This time, the European Commission is proposing to hit Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG).

However, the sanctions proposal does not suggest banning direct imports to the EU, which make up some 5 percent of the bloc's energy consumption and can be replaced immediately, according to European Commission estimates. Instead, a gradual approach is being suggested by forbidding transshipment, meaning that EU countries would be prevented from reexporting Russian LNG and therefore forcing Russian ships to make longer journeys to reach their final destination.

There is also a ban on investing or providing services for huge Russian LNG-infrastructure projects under construction -- Arctic LNG and Murmansk LNG. Big countries such as Germany, France, and Italy have already asked for an impact assessment of how these LNG-related measures will work, suggesting that member states are nervous about this move.

Deep Background: Another issue that might be tricky for EU member states to green-light is a proposed import ban on helium. So far, EU helium imports from Russia only amount to about $1 billion a year, but Russia has the ambition of becoming one of the world's biggest helium suppliers in the future.

In the proposal, there is also a push to expand the liability of sanctions violations to EU subsidiaries abroad, which could be a step too far for EU member states as they would argue that it is too complicated to keep track of everything that has been decided in Brussels and too much of a regulatory burden for companies.

What else is in the proposal? There is a prohibition on using the System For Transfer Of Financial Messages (SPFS), a sort of Moscow-based SWIFT, which should pass even though Hungary has expressed reservations.

Then there are things that appear straightforward but which potentially may not cut it with member states. One is the restriction on the use and transfer in Russia of plant-variety rights, which give farmers the exclusive control over the planting, harvesting, selling, exporting, and importing of certain species. France and Portugal have voiced concerns here, arguing that such a move could lead to global food scarcity.

It will also be interesting to see if a proposed ban on Russian state financing for EU-based political parties, foundations, think tanks, NGOs, and media service providers in the union won't be watered down. Some countries, notably Hungary and Slovakia, enjoy warm relations with the Kremlin and might lack the political will; others, such as the Netherlands and Sweden, have constitutional restrictions on the state interfering in media and civil society funding.

The proposed ban on acquiring Ukrainian cultural goods if there are suspicions that these items have been illegally removed from Ukraine should, however, fly. As will a bid to block the operation in the EU of transport companies that are at least 25 percent owned by Russians -- a more stringent measure than the status quo, where companies can only be blocked if Russians hold a majority stake. Measures hitting Russia's so-called shadow fleet, vessels with unclear ownership that Moscow is using to circumvent the bloc's oil transport ban, are also expected to pass.

What You Need To Know: One of the more successful, if perhaps underreported, European Union initiatives in recent years is the European Peace Facility (EPF), created back in 2021, to finance actions such as training missions and military equipment in third countries. The facility is outside the regular EU budget, meaning that the 27 member states of the bloc contribute as they see fit.

At the start, it was largely meant to finance projects and missions in Africa with a budget ceiling of 5.6 billion euros ($6 billion), but with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year later, the ceiling has now been elevated to 17 billion euros. The EPF has also allowed the EU as an organization for the first time ever to send lethal military aid, with assistance worth nearly $3.9 billion going to Ukraine.

Other countries in the EU's eastern neighborhood have also benefited from contributions from the fund. Last month, Moldova received some $44 million over a period of 40 months for nonlethal equipment in areas such as air surveillance, electronic warfare, and logistics. Georgia received more than $32 million last year to boost its army in the fields of military engineering, command and control, medical equipment, logistics, and cyberdefense -- a sum that came on top of previous contributions from the EU, worth $34.5 million, for similar purposes.

Deep Background: Now, once again, Georgia is in line for more cash from the EPF -- as is Armenia. For Armenia, it would be the first time ever it had received such funding and would signify a small but symbolic step for Yerevan in its relationship with the European Union. (There are even rumors in Brussels that Armenia might soon even apply to join the bloc.)

The draft EPF proposal, seen by RFE/RL, also hints at Armenia's closer cooperation with the bloc: ""the assistance measure aims to allow the armed forces to enhance operational effectiveness, accelerate compliance with (European) Union standards and interoperability, and thereby better protect civilians in crises and emergencies. It will also strengthen Armenia's capacities in regard to its future participation in EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) operations and missions.""

Interestingly, the proposal for Georgia contains the same wording. For both countries, the proposal states that the ""objective of the assistance measure is to contribute to the strengthening of the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia/Georgia's capacities to enhance national security, stability, and resilience in the defense sector.""

Watch out for the annual meeting of the foreign ministers of the Council of Europe, which focuses on promoting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law on the continent, in Strasbourg on May 16-17. There had been hopes that, after this session, Kosovo would be approved to join the organization. But as Pristina hasn't submitted a draft law on the establishment of an association of Serbian-majority municipalities -- a key sticking point between Kosovo and Serbia -- chances now appear slim that this will happen.

NATO countries' chiefs of defense will assemble in Brussels on May 16 to discuss weapon deliveries to Ukraine, a potential NATO mission to coordinate these deliveries and train troops, and how to ramp up military production in the alliance.

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Two million liters of water are needed to extract 1,000 kilos of lithium. Researchers are urgently searching for substitutes that are abundant, renewable, biodegradable, safe, low-cost and with little environmental impact. The solution may be near: sodium and calcium, two abundant elements that are being investigated to prevent lithium demand from multiplying by 60 in two decades, according to European Union forecasts.

Added to the unstoppable proliferation of home and portable devices are the two biggest challenges facing society: the electrification of mobility and the storage of renewable energy to provide continuous power. ""There are not enough lithium, cobalt and nickel ions to satisfy everyone's needs,"" says John Abou-Rjeily, a researcher at the company Tiamat Energy, which emerged from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS ) and which designs and manufactures sodium-ion batteries.

As reported in the UE's Horizon magazine, this doctor in Physics and Chemistry of Materials is investigating the possibilities of sodium, one of the most abundant chemical elements in the Earth's crust, and which is safer and cheaper to process than lithium. On the downside, it requires more space, which is why current batteries are not yet suitable for very small devices.

They also cannot compete with the range that current storage systems bring to electric cars, but they could serve as alternatives on shorter routes, which account for the majority of car trips. ""While I would never challenge the 500-kilometer range of lithium-ion batteries, this type of sodium-ion could be more competitive for short and medium distances by car, explains Abou-Rjeily.

Researchers from the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) and Delaware University (United States) are working along the same lines, according to a study published in Energy. ""There is a tendency to demand a really large battery. But according to research, generally, a slightly smaller one, with less range than that of a gasoline tank, is sufficient, since the only time in which you would need a greater autonomy is for a trip of six hours or more, in which case, the driver could charge on the go. There is too much emphasis on the need for a really long range and this leads to an increase in the price of the vehicle and a greater use of resources for electric cars,"" says Frances Sprei, a professor at Chalmers.

For this doctor in Energy and Environment, this change in mentality is necessary to adapt charging facilities where people spend the most time: at home and at work. Sprei regrets that, on the contrary, many European countries focus on the charging network on roads.

This simple modification of the perception of needs would further promote sodium as an alternative, since it would allow the technology to be deployed in homes and workplaces as energy storage systems from renewable sources. This is the goal pursued by Magdalena Graczyk-Zajac, a visiting professor at the Technical University Darmstadt in Germany, and member of the European SIMBA project, a EU-funded initiative to develop a sodium-ion battery for homes which concludes its first phase next June.

This researcher is committed to finding ways to store the energy captured by home photovoltaic panels in a rechargeable sodium ion domestic battery. This would power the homes and charge the electric vehicles of its residents with a significant cost reduction. ""You could be driving your car for free for eight to nine months of the year,"" she says. A prototype is already in laboratory tests.

One part of the battery, the anode, is made from hard carbon, which can be manufactured from wood or biowaste. Another, the cathode, can be made of a material called Prussian white, a chemical compound from a blue pigment of the same name, but with more sodium and rich in iron, one of the most abundant metals.

The Basque research center CIC energiGUNE has its own development in this area: a sodium metal anode with a thickness of only seven microns (70 times thinner than the current ones) achieved through a physical evaporation process. According to this center, the advance opens the door to the manufacture of flexible solid-state batteries with the thin sodium anode, a safer, cheaper and smaller alternative to the current batteries with liquid electrolyte in which graphite is used.

""Sodium cannot be easily laminated due to its sticky texture, similar to plasticine,"" explains Montse GalcerÃ¡n, the principal researcher of this project. ""To date, the most common method used to roll a block of sodium was as basic as processing it with a hammer, but this meant that a thin and homogeneous sheet could not be obtained, and, therefore, there was a large excess of unused sodium in the batteries. Thanks to evaporation, we have managed to overcome that obstacle,"" she says.

This thinning of the anode allows researchers to reduce the amount of sodium needed, as well as the costs, weight and dimensions of the batteries, while increasing energy density (greater storage capacity) and safety.

Another element that is used as a substitute for lithium is calcium. ""It is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust and it is not concentrated in specific geographic areas, as is the case with lithium. If the raw material is cheap, the batteries can also be cheap,"" says Rosa PalacÃ­n, from the Institute of Materials Science of Barcelona (ICMAB-CSIC) and a member of the CARBAT project.

Using calcium as a negative electrode offers advantages over graphite in lithium-ion batteries, since it has a greater accumulation capacity per kilogram (energy density) than conventional lithium batteries, which also form tiny rigid structures called dendrites and can cause short circuits or explode after many uses, according to this institution.

""When calcium passes through the electrolyte, two electrons flow out, instead of one, as in the case of lithium. It can be assumed that a battery of the same size would offer greater autonomy if used in an electric vehicle, as long as a suitable positive electrode is found,"" explains PalacÃ­n.

The key is choosing the most appropriate components. ""It appears that ultimately all working electrolyte salts contain boron. We use calcium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in a mixture of ethylene and propylene carbonate,"" says the researcher.

Other researchers from the Technical University of Denmark are searching, as part of the SALBAGE project, for a battery made from an aluminum anode and a sulfur cathode. Aluminum is even more abundant than calcium, but incorporating it into a battery poses similar difficulties.

""All the materials used are cheap. Aluminum, sulfur, the electrolyte itself and urea are very, very cheap. Even the polymer is,"" says the researcher Juan Lastra, who defends this option to store energy from a wind or solar park.",english.elpais.com,news,EL PAÃS,RaÃºl LimÃ³n,0.1529411764705881,454277955,11,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/3SSHVIOBEEQ7FKJOWQN6LSLCOM.jpg?auth=9d3787c66a540268283208b5d7b8518f1e588837c174c4e97934f16f4f450e4a&width=1200,

True evil often begins with a masquerade. The most vicious regimes in history have depended on the pretensions of benevolence and the avowal of a higher purpose. The Kremlin asserts that Ukraine is not a country but part of Russia that was lost after the Soviet Union fell. This is untrue.

Russian President Vladimir Putin rules a nation and threatens the world. He does so by inculcating fear and luxuriating in indifference. America cannot be indifferent to this scourge, for Russian success in Ukraine will place Putin at the heart of an axis composed of Russia, China, and Iran. We must not allow this murderous phalanx to be revivified after having been weakened by the astute actions of the Trump administration.

Any accord that substantiates Russia's domination of Ukrainian provinces, including parts of the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson Oblasts, as well as Crimea, is unacceptable. The annexation of these Ukrainian territories, when coupled with Moscow's influence over Transnistria in Moldova since 1992 and its suzerainty over Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia since 2008, will set the template for China's invasion and intended dominion over Taiwan and areas of the South China Sea, for it would control parts of the First Island Chain.

For Iran, territorial domination may be represented not by an absolute command of foreign nations but through terrorist acts designed to destabilize Israel and the Arab Gulf states. Thus, anything resembling a Russian victory in Ukraine will resound across the world, imperiling free nations on distant continents.

Actions

Decisiveness and intrepidity by the United States are required, not lassitude and perplexity. U.S. President Joseph Biden promised to burnish other nations' respect for America at his inauguration. Nevertheless, his administration made several critical errors in its first year, with disastrous repercussions. It executed a deadly and calamitous retreat from Afghanistan that both armed and invigorated our nation's enemies; risked our energy independence to please environmental extremists; fortified the Kremlin by restricting American hydrocarbon production and approving the Russian Nordstream II pipeline; and impaired Saudi Arabia by delisting Iran's Houthi proxies as a terrorist organization. The Houthis remain the scion of Iran, the rogue state with which the president sought to reestablish a discredited nuclear agreement.

Should the Biden administration's failings continue, such enfeeblement may serve to greenlight the next war by demonstrating a weakness of purpose and negligence in planning. We must contest aggression, not signal our incapacity to forestall it.

Decisiveness can be defined as unrepressed action pursuant to an objective. Clustered around this word are others: resolve, certainty, determination, firmness, grit, and power. These are words Putin understands. Anything resembling negotiation constitutes nothing but a mask or pause that the Kremlin will repurpose to realize its goals of expansion, occupation, and domination.

President Donald Trump exemplified decisiveness in his contestation of China and Iran, in his termination of Major General Qasem Soleimani, the murderous head of Iran's Quds Force, and in his establishment of the Abraham Accords. I, therefore, believe that when Donald Trump speaks of ending the war in Ukraine in one day, he refers to his plan for resolute and immutable action in his conduct of America's international relations and not to any accommodation of Moscow's aims. It is decisive American support for Ukraine that will end the war on terms acceptable to Ukraine and NATO.

Had President Trump won the 2020 election, it is extraordinarily doubtful that Putin would have had the temerity to invade Ukraine in 2022, for the abhorrent and ill-planned retreat from Afghanistan would not have occurred. Though we cannot undo the past, we should be mindful of our words. It is one thing to say that protecting America's borders is of equal or greater importance than protecting Ukraine's. It makes no sense to argue, however, that if money is not allocated to protect America's borders, Ukraine's should be left molested. That is akin to cutting off one's nose to spite his face. It is logically deficient since it ensures the worst possible outcome in each domain.

Wisely, the House of Representatives rejected this trap and passed a crucial bill to support Ukraine on April 20, 2024. Legislators from both parties joined together in their appreciation of freedom, understanding that apathy, fear, and isolation do not define strategy; they presage defeat.

In Ukraine, men and women of extraordinary courage sacrifice themselves to secure liberty for their children and fellow citizens, and they deserve our most sincere support. Field Manual No. 3-0 was publicly distributed by the U.S. Army on October 1, 2022. It stipulates a defining principle of combat, namely the importance of mass, or the integration of ""all the elements of combat power and synchronizing their application against a decisive point.""

Mass and concentration can create ""overwhelming combat power at specific locations to support the main effort."" Regrettably, despite the positive steps taken by Congress, these precepts are absent from President Biden's policies.

In his classic treatise on strategy, Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz argued that in war, it is imperative not to waste time. The Biden administration's recalcitrance in providing heavy armaments to Ukraine wasted precious time as it hindered Kyiv's decisive application of mass.

If the weapons that were subsequently supplied to Ukraine had been delivered in a timely manner, a pivotal advantage would have been conveyed to Ukraine. Long-range missiles are essential to modern warfare but were not provided in the first year of combat. Such weapons are vital to hold Russian formations at risk, thereby greatly complicating the Kremlin's plans for enveloping engagements.

In the aftermath of Russia's invasion on February 24, 2022, portable weapons, which included the Javelin anti-tank missile provided by the Trump administration, should have been bolstered immediately by the delivery of M1 tanks -- held in storage -- as well as fourth-generation fighter aircraft, such as the F-16. The early introduction of the M1 and other comparable German and British tanks would have allowed Ukraine to institute more effective combined arms[7] [RL8] tactics, fusing these heavy tanks with infantry and other vital components of warfare before the proliferation of Russian drone swarms, which must now be countered.

The F-16 first flew in 1974. Only now, years after Russia's invasion, are a number of these planes headed to Ukraine. Had significant quantities of technologically advanced systems been transferred to Ukraine immediately after Russia's invasion, such rapidity would have saved lives by facilitating Ukraine's mastery of the battlespace.

Commitment

By supporting Ukraine, we prevent a larger European war that may involve America's military due to our Article 5 treaty commitment to the integrity of NATO member states. By helping Ukraine, we prevent Russia's reconstitution of its old empire, which would act in accordance with Iran and China, to dictate world fossil-fuel prices, causing cascading economic strife in America and across the globe.

Freedom is not an afterthought. It is a rare condition throughout history and remains the most precious commodity that humanity has ever attained. In light of the stakes involved, we must allow Ukraine to dictate the terms of any peace. The global geostrategic dangers leave our nation no choice but to support Ukraine's crusade to recapture all of its territory.

Context

Sweden's and Finland's ascension to NATO membership mandates our consideration of the post-war European landscape. The Three Seas Initiative and other groups of nations that border Ukraine must consider shared security goals after Russia's objectives are defeated. Such steps constitute a necessary prologue to NATO membership for Ukraine, which can only be realized after victory and the establishment of borders that are permanent and free of Russian intrusion.

By empowering Ukraine to reestablish control over its sovereign territory, we rupture China's designs against Taiwan, thus helping to prevent an assault that would shatter the living standards of the world by crippling supplies of essential goods such as semiconductors. Therefore, we must act in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity lest we undercut our nation's own interests.

By aiding Ukraine, we undermine the creation of a Chinese-Russian axis bent on exerting military and economic hegemony, which would devastate our economy. In the Middle East and Africa, a Chinese-Russian axis would fuse with Iran and other terrorist forces to form a machine of conquest and influence.

The calamitous war in Ukraine is the result of Russia's mechanisms of subjugation, which have been allowed to feed on the world's (Europe's in particular) demands for natural gas and other hydrocarbons. Russia's energy sector, which rests on oil, coal, and natural gas revenue, funds a significant part of its federal budget.

If Russia is allowed to exert dominion over the Donbas and Ukraine's coast, the Kremlin will next seek to control the energy resources of other independent countries that were once part of the Soviet Empire. Russia will become a juggernaut, dominating fossil fuels in addition to its present lead in supplying nuclear power plants to recipient nations across the globe. This is what is at risk. It is thus imperative that the principles of American military and energy dominance be advanced, as must our restraint in the use of force that commits our country to battle, for our nation's armed forces must not fight in Ukraine.",nationalinterest.org,news,The National Interest,,-0.2392156862745098,454100221,5,https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/Ukraine_War_SS.jpg,

Finland and Sweden simultaneously handed their official application letters to join NATO over to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on May 18, 2022. The decision was particularly welcomed by their Nordic-Baltic neighbors, who all raced to get the two applications ratified and deposited with the U.S. State Department. The decision also prompted several officials and experts to express their delight with the decision by calling the Baltic Sea a NATO lake. However, as past incidents with undersea infrastructure show, these calls might be overly optimistic.

Attacks on Nord Stream, the Balticconnector Pipeline, and Communications Cables

On September 26, 2022, powerful blasts ruptured three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that, as a result of the explosions, more than 500 kilotons of methane leaked into the atmosphere within a week. NATO's North Atlantic Council called the damage ""deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin called it an ""act of international terrorism."" The explosions occurred in both Sweden and Denmark's exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and both nations opened separate investigations into the attacks. Despite Russian denials, the initial sentiment was that Moscow was most likely behind the sabotage. In February 2024 Sweden concluded its investigation claiming that because neither Sweden's citizens nor interests were harmed, the Swedish jurisdiction did not apply. Denmark also concluded its probe into the incident whereas Germany is at this point continuing its separate investigation into the matter.

While the Swedish and Danish security police and intelligence services never publicly named a suspect, several questionable theories were put forward in the press. Notably, on February 8, 2023, Seymour Hersh, whose reputation as a journalist has been discredited over the last decade as he has increasingly engaged in what many deem conspiracy theories, published an article based on one ""well-informed"" source that placed the blame on the United States and Norway. The report was debunked by both the U.S. and Norwegian governments. Unsurprisingly, Moscow was the only one to agree with the claims. In March 2023 an article in the New York Times alleged that a pro-Ukrainian group was responsible for the sabotage. At the same time, German media reported -- based on information from security circles, ship tracker data, and satellite images -- that a few days before the attacks, Russian military ships that had the necessary equipment to attach explosive devices were operating in the area of the explosion. From these vastly different assessments it is clear that hybrid methods of warfare -- such as propaganda, deception, sabotage, and other nonmilitary tactics -- are extremely difficult to attribute to an attacker with the level of certainty needed to bring forth charges.

Almost a year after the Nord Stream incident, in October 2023, news broke out that the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland had been damaged in the Finnish EEZ and that the pipeline had to be closed due to a leak. A few days later, Swedish Defense Minister PÃ¥l Jonson announced that a nearby data cable between Estonia and Finland had also been damaged during the same time frame in the Estonian EEZ. The Finnish authorities soon informed the public that the damage to the gas pipeline seemed to have been man-made and carried out deliberately. The following week, the Swedish authorities announced that a data cable between Estonia and Sweden in the Estonian EEZ had also been damaged a half-day before the Balticconnector incident.

The initial reactions to the Balticconnector and Nord Stream incidents were very similar. Prosecutors started investigations, careful not to place the blame on any particular actor, while the general feeling was that Russia was the most likely culprit. Initial open-source reporting supported that theory, as the Russian cargo ship SVG Flot was near the location at the time of the incident. However, more careful analysis revealed that the vessel that was closest to the scene at the time of the incident was Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which was sailing under the Hong Kong flag, and Finnish authorities later uncovered an anchor from the Newnew Polar Bear at the site.

Finnish and Estonian authorities have both contacted Chinese authorities and made international requests for legal assistance for the investigation of the Balticconnector incident and the cut communication cables. China is officially cooperating with Finnish authorities regarding the incident: in January 2024, then Finnish president Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Chinese President Xi Jinping met and discussed the issue, among others. Nevertheless, the question of intent remains. According to experts, dropping and dragging an anchor is felt on the vessel, which makes it unlikely that it could have been an accident, especially given the distance that the anchor was dragged. Most likely, as in the case of Nord Stream, the investigation will take some time as intent is very difficult to prove in these types of attacks. Parallel to the official investigation, Kalle Kilk, the CEO of Elering, the company that operates the pipeline from the Estonian side, announced in February 2024 that the company is preparing to launch a claim against the Chinese company that owns Newnew Polar Bear

Further muddling the picture, on November 6, 2023, Finland revealed that the Russian Baltika cable had also suffered damage. Russian authorities had informed Finnish officials about the damage on October 12, since the cable is partly located in Finland's EEZ. The delay in Moscow's communication could be a sign that it took Russian leaders by surprise, so they had not yet prepared a communication strategy. The Baltika cable is about a 1,000-kilometer-long communications cable that belongs to state-owned Rostelecom; it runs from the St. Petersburg region to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The damage occurred 28 kilometers from the Balticconnector damage site, indicating that the incidents may be linked. This complicates the puzzle even further as it is very hard to believe that the Chinese vessel would have intentionally damaged an important Russian communications cable.

NATO's Response to the Attacks

NATO's response to these incidents so far has been a strong display of unity and increasing deterrence measures in the region. Allies have expressed support to Estonia and Finland as they continue their joint investigation. During the regular NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting that took place a few days after the incident, allies expressed strong solidarity with Estonia and Finland, and Stoltenberg promised that NATO would have a united and determined response, if it was proven that the incident was a deliberate attack. NATO and its allies also stepped up patrols in the Baltic Sea, including additional surveillance and reconnaissance flights, and dispatched a fleet of four NATO minehunters to the area.

The alliance has also established a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO's Maritime Command as well as a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to ""improve information sharing and exchange best practices between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector."" In addition, allied defense ministers have endorsed the Digital Ocean Vision Initiative, which aims to enhance NATO's maritime situational awareness from seabed to space.

In addition, during the October 2023 Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) leaders meeting, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to increase the UK's presence in Northern Europe to deepen cooperation on tackling hybrid threats and to protect critical national infrastructure. As a result, the UK will deploy more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, marines, and air personnel, alongside eight Royal Navy ships, that will take part in various activities in different countries in the region. While the ships will not be able to prevent future attacks, increased allied presence serves as a welcome deterrent. Under NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence framework, the UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, which connects the kingdom closely to the region. The UK has always valued its relationship with the Nordic-Baltic region, so it is natural that London wants to show support in this situation. This increase in presence will not be permanent but could be a precursor to increased NATO presence in the Baltic Sea in the future.

Finland and Sweden joining NATO will add significantly to the alliance's ability to secure critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finland and Sweden were already close NATO partners, but now allies can look at the Baltic Sea in a comprehensive manner and incorporate Finnish and Swedish air and sea ports and respective capabilities into NATO defense plans with a level of certainty that was not there before.

The maritime capabilities that Finland and Sweden bring to the alliance are compatible with the Baltic Sea environment. The biggest assets in this context are the Swedish submarines, including three advanced Gotland-class submarines. In addition, two new design A26 vessels are going to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, giving Sweden five submarines by the end of the decade. These submarines are unique as they can easily operate and patrol in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, which is not the case for all allied submarines. The Swedish submarines are ideal for the defense of allied infrastructure, including for the protection of pipelines on the seabed and for destruction of enemy infrastructure in the case of war. They also add to NATO's listening capabilities, useful for mapping the potentially malign activities of Russian ships and submarines.

While Finland and Sweden joining NATO improves the security in and around the Baltic Sea, the sea remains an international body of water that is not fully under NATO control. Russia has important seaports in and around St. Petersburg as well as in Kaliningrad. A lot of international shipping flows through these ports. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, there has been an increase in containers arriving to St. Petersburg's container port, which shows that despite sanctions and export controls imposed by Western countries, Russian trade through these ports continues to be important. In addition to military vessels and international shipping, there are cruise ships, private yachts, and other vessels passing through the Baltic Sea daily. All in all, there is a lot of activity in the Baltic Sea that NATO allies currently do not have complete visibility over.

What More Should NATO Allies Do to Protect Undersea Infrastructure?

There are hundreds of kilometers of vital infrastructure, including power and communications cables as well as gas pipelines, under the Baltic Sea. In addition, there are plans to develop new offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which will also be part of the critical infrastructure and will be similarly subject to sabotage. An adversary could, for instance, plant explosives near them, in line with the Nord Stream attacks. Given the vulnerability of the infrastructure and the increase in hybrid attacks, like the ones against Nord Stream and Balticconnector, countries in the Baltic Sea region need to start thinking about how to avoid these incidents in the future. As Estonia's commander of military intelligence has pointed out, it is practically impossible to ensure undersea cables and gas pipelines are protected at all times, however, there are steps the alliance can take to decrease the likelihood of attacks.

Following the Balticconnector incident, several officials proposed ways to protect undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. One option, floated by Latvian President Edgars RinkÄviÄs, would be to close the Baltic Sea for shipping if Russia were found responsible for damaging the Balticconnector. The idea was met with staunch criticism not only from Russia, obviously, but also from experts in NATO countries who claimed that the idea would be difficult to implement given maritime law and practice. Although Denmark can close the Danish Straits on occasion, Denmark can only close the straits to all ships or planes of a certain country if it is at war with that country.

Another option would be to extend the territorial waters of both Estonia and Finland so that there would not be any EEZ between them. The idea behind this is that the sovereignty of Estonia and Finland would increase, including their respective right and power to control the extended area of the sea. However, the idea has been rebuffed by experts, as this right of unimpeded passage would also apply in the Gulf of Finland: the freedom of overflight and navigation, which are currently only allowed in EEZs and not in territorial waters, would apply from the Finnish coast to the Estonian coast, including in the territorial waters of Estonia and Finland. This would increase the freedoms for Russia to operate in areas that are currently limited by the existing legal framework. Basically, as both proposed legal options have significant flaws, there seems to be no legal fix to the situation.

There are different technical solutions to addressing these threats, including investing in underwater sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, as well as increased maritime surveillance. All these are viable options to a degree but given the number of different cables and their varying ownership structures, it is difficult to impose a solution that would guarantee the safety of all of them. The allied governments can increase overall maritime surveillance, but the investments into different technologies, like sensors, drones, and autonomous robot ships, would need to come from the companies that operate infrastructure, such as data cables or pipelines, on the seabed. The technologies provide information from different angles, but none of them would make the infrastructure 100 percent secure. Therefore, it is very difficult for governments to mandate the companies to do something specific. At the same time, the technologies are in constant development, and something that might be the best solution today might be outdated tomorrow.

To align and coordinate its response, NATO urgently needs to create a NATO command that would focus solely on the Baltic Sea. This would help allies move on from the current debate about which Joint Force Command (JFC) Finland and Sweden should fall under: JFC Norfolk, together with other Nordic countries, or JFC Brunssum, like the Baltic States. The establishment of the new command would ensure that nothing falls between the cracks between the JFCs and that NATO activities and responsibilities could run smoothly across the whole Baltic Sea area of operations. Germany has already offered to host a new NATO Baltic Sea naval command, and other allies could put forward similar proposals, including Poland and Sweden. NATO's Washington Summit, scheduled for July 2024, will be the perfect venue to formally decide the establishment of this new command.

Conclusion

The Nord Stream and Balticconnector incidents highlight the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the growing significance of seabed warfare. NATO and individual allies have responded to the incidents by establishing various investigations, increasing their presence on and around the Baltic Sea, and creating new bodies to share information and improve awareness. Further legal and technical solutions are under discussion, but it is clear that there are no easy fixes. This underscores the need for a solution to the contested question of how NATO should handle its increased presence in the region. Amid the ongoing debate over how to divide responsibilities across NATO commands, new security issues -- like critical infrastructure and energy security, which do not fall neatly into NATO's traditional threat assessment -- risk getting lost in the debate over commands. The alliance needs a comprehensive view of these new challenges and establishing a new maritime command might be the best solution to bring the issues together.

Ukraine Is Still Hitting Them.,"On May 19, a Ukrainian drone slammed into the 70,000-barrel-a-day Slavyansk oil refinery in southern Russia's Krasnodar region, sending a fireball into the sky, according to videos circulating on social media.

It was the third time in two months that Ukrainian forces hit the relatively small plant located several hundred kilometers from the front, dodging Russian air defense systems. The latest strike forced Slavyansk to temporarily shut down until the damage could be repaired.

The hits on the refinery were part of a campaign of drone strikes on energy infrastructure inside Russia that Ukraine has carried out in defiance of the United States, which has urged Kyiv not to target such facilities as it defends itself against a full-scale invasion now well into its third year.

The U.S. objections are related to a broader and increasingly heated debate over whether Ukraine should attack targets in Russia, particularly when it is using weapons provided by the West.

Following a spate of successful Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries earlier this year, Artyom Verkhov, a Russian Energy Ministry official, told parliament in March that there were plans to protect some oil and gas infrastructure with missile systems. Meanwhile, companies began taking matters into their own hands amid a reported shortage of air defenses, setting up mobile air defense groups armed with machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and electronic warfare weapons as well as covering potential targets with metallic nets.

But in the cat-and-mouse game of drone and anti-drone innovation, Ukraine's rapid technological advances and growing output of unmanned aircraft is keeping it one step ahead of Russia's defenses, analysts say, leaving the Kremlin's vast energy infrastructure network in European Russia vulnerable.

Eduard Trudnyev, a Slavyansk security official, told Russian state news agency TASS that Ukraine used bigger and more powerful drones in the most recent strike than in previous attacks on the plant.

Ukraine has invested heavily in the development and production of long-range drones with heavier payloads and lower susceptibility to jamming. Some can hit targets more than 1,000 kilometers from the front lines.

That puts about half of Russia's refining capacity within striking distance, experts say. While it would be virtually impossible for Ukraine to knock out all that capacity at the same time, the intermittent attacks are a headache for the Kremlin and its energy industry.

The strikes ""create uncertainty,"" Olga Khakova, an energy security analyst at the Atlantic Council, a U.S. think tank, told a conference on May 23. The campaign of attacks ""forces Russia to think about how to protect these critical energy infrastructure installations.""

Russia has concentrated its air defenses along the front lines and the border with Ukraine to focus on protecting the Ukrainian airspace under its control and military bases in Russian border areas, said George Barros, an analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

""It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to have those systems laid out like polka dots on the interior of your country, especially one as vast as Russia. You really intercept these sorts of threats at the borders of your airspace, not the interior,"" Barros said.

Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the Russian parliament's defense committee, said last year that Russia only had enough air defense assets in the interior to protect important government and military facilities and recommended companies acquire their own capabilities.

Dara Massicot, a military analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Russia might choose to move air defense systems located in the Far East and Arctic, where there is no immediate threat, to the central regions to protect some facilities there.

Rapid Rebound

Ukraine has now carried out more than 20 attacks on Russian refineries and energy infrastructure so far in 2024, temporarily knocking out 14 percent of capacity at the peak in late March.

Some refineries, like Slavyansk and Tuapse, also in the Krasnodar region, have been hit more than once, underscoring the difficulty of protecting such facilities, especially when drones are launched in large numbers. Ukraine launched at least 57 into the Krasnodar region on May 18-19, according to Russia.

After the first series of refinery strikes at the start of the year, Russia imposed a six-month ban on the export of gasoline, effective March 1, in an effort to ensure the domestic market is fully supplied and prices stay low. Like many governments, Russia's fears that high gasoline prices could trigger social discontent.

In targeting refineries, Ukraine is seeking to curtail Russian oil export revenue, the single biggest source of money for the federal budget, and to disrupt the domestic fuel market, experts say. Some experts say the impact will be minor because Russia's oil industry has flexibility built into its structure.

Russia on average refines more than 5 million barrels of oil a day, far outstripping domestic demand, allowing it to cut exports in the face of a fuel price spike. Since the start of the war in February 2022, Russia has temporarily banned gasoline exports on more than one occasion to ensure price stability at home.

Overall, Russia has a refining capacity of about 6.5 million barrels a day, according to the Britain-based Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, so it can use this spare capacity to absorb shutdowns. It also has the option of pushing back seasonal maintenance at some refineries if others are knocked offline.

Russia can also export more crude in lieu of refined products, offsetting revenue losses. Total Russian oil export revenue declined only marginally in April, as higher crude export volumes and higher oil prices largely offset a 16 percent decline in revenue from oil product exports, according to the Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).

Russia has been able to repair some of the damage to its refineries quicker than many expected. In a sign of a rapid rebound, Russia announced it would resume gasoline exports from May 20 to June 30 amid excess stock at refineries and ports.

In a monthly market update on May 15, the International Energy Agency said Russia's refineries have so far avoided significant production losses, adding that it initially overestimated the impact on second quarter output.

Russia's May refining level is estimated at 5 million barrels a day, the IEA said in a statement to RFE/RL. It would be between 5.2-5.3 million barrels a day without the strikes, implying a loss of just 4 to 6 percent.

""The reported damage, while widespread does not appear to have disrupted processing rates to the extent we had anticipated and some refineries started up sooner than we had assumed,"" the IEA said in its statement to RFE/RL.

Sergei Vakulenko, the former head of strategy and innovations at Russian state-owned oil company Gazpromneft, said the Ukrainian strikes are more a nuisance than a calamity.

""Attacks on the Russian refining sector do create losses for Russia, but so far it has been mostly 'bothering fire,' Vakulenko, who is now an analyst at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in a May 9 post on Substack. ""It has not been material. It has not created any shortages of fuels. It did not have serious effects on fuel prices in Russia.""

Morale Booster

But the attacks are a morale-booster for Ukraine, and a display of its capabilities against the much larger invader. Moreover, experts say that if Ukraine keeps up the strikes on refineries, Russia could increasingly struggle to repair them in a timely fashion due to U.S. and European sanctions, experts say. Russia's oil refining industry is dependent on Western technology for some of its advanced processes.

While the strikes haven't had a massive impact yet, effects could manifest themselves in the longer run, said Isaac Levi, an analyst at CREA.

Continued strikes could also put pressure on Russia's expansive rail network if gasoline and diesel products must be shipped thousands of kilometers westward from refineries in the Urals and Siberia, experts say.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has urged Ukraine to stop targeting Russian refineries amid concerns it could push oil prices up at a time when inflation in many parts of the world is still high. Russia is one of the world's largest exporters of refined oil products.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Senate Armed Services Committee that attacks on refineries could have ""a knock-on effect in terms of the global energy situation."" Ukraine is ""better served in going after tactical and operational targets that can directly influence the current fight,"" he said.

So far, there has been no substantial impact on global markets. Oil prices were trading near a three-month low on May 28.

Ukraine says refineries are legitimate targets and does not seem to be heeding the U.S. requests.

Kyiv is likely to be able to continue to mount successful strikes on Russia's energy industry despite Moscow's attempts to boost defenses, experts say.

Ukraine has been slowly degrading Russia's air defenses, opening some gaps in coverage. And with production of long-range drones growing, it can launch a greater number of them into Russian territory at the same time, saturating air defenses.

""If the Ukrainians can launch a high volume of long-range drones, then even with a low success rate they are bound to pull off successful strikes,"" the ISW's Barros said.

True evil often begins with a masquerade. The most vicious regimes in history have depended on the pretensions of benevolence and the avowal of a higher purpose. The Kremlin asserts that Ukraine is not a country but part of Russia that was lost after the Soviet Union fell. This is untrue.

Russian President Vladimir Putin rules a nation and threatens the world. He does so by inculcating fear and luxuriating in indifference. America cannot be indifferent to this scourge, for Russian success in Ukraine will place Putin at the heart of an axis composed of Russia, China, and Iran. We must not allow this murderous phalanx to be revivified after having been weakened by the astute actions of the Trump administration.

Any accord that substantiates Russia's domination of Ukrainian provinces, including parts of the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson Oblasts, as well as Crimea, is unacceptable. The annexation of these Ukrainian territories, when coupled with Moscow's influence over Transnistria in Moldova since 1992 and its suzerainty over Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia since 2008, will set the template for China's invasion and intended dominion over Taiwan and areas of the South China Sea, for it would control parts of the First Island Chain.

For Iran, territorial domination may be represented not by an absolute command of foreign nations but through terrorist acts designed to destabilize Israel and the Arab Gulf states. Thus, anything resembling a Russian victory in Ukraine will resound across the world, imperiling free nations on distant continents.

Actions

Decisiveness and intrepidity by the United States are required, not lassitude and perplexity. U.S. President Joseph Biden promised to burnish other nations' respect for America at his inauguration. Nevertheless, his administration made several critical errors in its first year, with disastrous repercussions. It executed a deadly and calamitous retreat from Afghanistan that both armed and invigorated our nation's enemies; risked our energy independence to please environmental extremists; fortified the Kremlin by restricting American hydrocarbon production and approving the Russian Nordstream II pipeline; and impaired Saudi Arabia by delisting Iran's Houthi proxies as a terrorist organization. The Houthis remain the scion of Iran, the rogue state with which the president sought to reestablish a discredited nuclear agreement.

Should the Biden administration's failings continue, such enfeeblement may serve to greenlight the next war by demonstrating a weakness of purpose and negligence in planning. We must contest aggression, not signal our incapacity to forestall it.

Decisiveness can be defined as unrepressed action pursuant to an objective. Clustered around this word are others: resolve, certainty, determination, firmness, grit, and power. These are words Putin understands. Anything resembling negotiation constitutes nothing but a mask or pause that the Kremlin will repurpose to realize its goals of expansion, occupation, and domination.

President Donald Trump exemplified decisiveness in his contestation of China and Iran, in his termination of Major General Qasem Soleimani, the murderous head of Iran's Quds Force, and in his establishment of the Abraham Accords. I, therefore, believe that when Donald Trump speaks of ending the war in Ukraine in one day, he refers to his plan for resolute and immutable action in his conduct of America's international relations and not to any accommodation of Moscow's aims. It is decisive American support for Ukraine that will end the war on terms acceptable to Ukraine and NATO.

Had President Trump won the 2020 election, it is extraordinarily doubtful that Putin would have had the temerity to invade Ukraine in 2022, for the abhorrent and ill-planned retreat from Afghanistan would not have occurred. Though we cannot undo the past, we should be mindful of our words. It is one thing to say that protecting America's borders is of equal or greater importance than protecting Ukraine's. It makes no sense to argue, however, that if money is not allocated to protect America's borders, Ukraine's should be left molested. That is akin to cutting off one's nose to spite his face. It is logically deficient since it ensures the worst possible outcome in each domain.

Wisely, the House of Representatives rejected this trap and passed a crucial bill to support Ukraine on April 20, 2024. Legislators from both parties joined together in their appreciation of freedom, understanding that apathy, fear, and isolation do not define strategy; they presage defeat.

In Ukraine, men and women of extraordinary courage sacrifice themselves to secure liberty for their children and fellow citizens, and they deserve our most sincere support. Field Manual No. 3-0 was publicly distributed by the U.S. Army on October 1, 2022. It stipulates a defining principle of combat, namely the importance of mass, or the integration of ""all the elements of combat power and synchronizing their application against a decisive point.""

Mass and concentration can create ""overwhelming combat power at specific locations to support the main effort."" Regrettably, despite the positive steps taken by Congress, these precepts are absent from President Biden's policies.

In his classic treatise on strategy, Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz argued that in war, it is imperative not to waste time. The Biden administration's recalcitrance in providing heavy armaments to Ukraine wasted precious time as it hindered Kyiv's decisive application of mass.

If the weapons that were subsequently supplied to Ukraine had been delivered in a timely manner, a pivotal advantage would have been conveyed to Ukraine. Long-range missiles are essential to modern warfare but were not provided in the first year of combat. Such weapons are vital to hold Russian formations at risk, thereby greatly complicating the Kremlin's plans for enveloping engagements.

In the aftermath of Russia's invasion on February 24, 2022, portable weapons, which included the Javelin anti-tank missile provided by the Trump administration, should have been bolstered immediately by the delivery of M1 tanks -- held in storage -- as well as fourth-generation fighter aircraft, such as the F-16. The early introduction of the M1 and other comparable German and British tanks would have allowed Ukraine to institute more effective combined arms[7] [RL8] tactics, fusing these heavy tanks with infantry and other vital components of warfare before the proliferation of Russian drone swarms, which must now be countered.

The F-16 first flew in 1974. Only now, years after Russia's invasion, are a number of these planes headed to Ukraine. Had significant quantities of technologically advanced systems been transferred to Ukraine immediately after Russia's invasion, such rapidity would have saved lives by facilitating Ukraine's mastery of the battlespace.

Commitment

By supporting Ukraine, we prevent a larger European war that may involve America's military due to our Article 5 treaty commitment to the integrity of NATO member states. By helping Ukraine, we prevent Russia's reconstitution of its old empire, which would act in accordance with Iran and China, to dictate world fossil-fuel prices, causing cascading economic strife in America and across the globe.

Freedom is not an afterthought. It is a rare condition throughout history and remains the most precious commodity that humanity has ever attained. In light of the stakes involved, we must allow Ukraine to dictate the terms of any peace. The global geostrategic dangers leave our nation no choice but to support Ukraine's crusade to recapture all of its territory.

Context

Sweden's and Finland's ascension to NATO membership mandates our consideration of the post-war European landscape. The Three Seas Initiative and other groups of nations that border Ukraine must consider shared security goals after Russia's objectives are defeated. Such steps constitute a necessary prologue to NATO membership for Ukraine, which can only be realized after victory and the establishment of borders that are permanent and free of Russian intrusion.

By empowering Ukraine to reestablish control over its sovereign territory, we rupture China's designs against Taiwan, thus helping to prevent an assault that would shatter the living standards of the world by crippling supplies of essential goods such as semiconductors. Therefore, we must act in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity lest we undercut our nation's own interests.

By aiding Ukraine, we undermine the creation of a Chinese-Russian axis bent on exerting military and economic hegemony, which would devastate our economy. In the Middle East and Africa, a Chinese-Russian axis would fuse with Iran and other terrorist forces to form a machine of conquest and influence.

The calamitous war in Ukraine is the result of Russia's mechanisms of subjugation, which have been allowed to feed on the world's (Europe's in particular) demands for natural gas and other hydrocarbons. Russia's energy sector, which rests on oil, coal, and natural gas revenue, funds a significant part of its federal budget.

If Russia is allowed to exert dominion over the Donbas and Ukraine's coast, the Kremlin will next seek to control the energy resources of other independent countries that were once part of the Soviet Empire. Russia will become a juggernaut, dominating fossil fuels in addition to its present lead in supplying nuclear power plants to recipient nations across the globe. This is what is at risk. It is thus imperative that the principles of American military and energy dominance be advanced, as must our restraint in the use of force that commits our country to battle, for our nation's armed forces must not fight in Ukraine.",nationalinterest.org,news,The National Interest,,-0.2392156862745098,454100221,3,https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/Ukraine_War_SS.jpg,

The new sponsor sparked controversy, with Economy Minister Robert Habeck saying the ""unusual"" sponsor was also a reflection that ""unfortunately we are (now) in another, more threatening world"".

The three-year tie-up includes advertising space at Dortmund's ground and at press conferences, Rheinmetall said in a statement.

Rheinmetall's logo would already appear around the club in the build-up to Saturday's Champions League final at Wembley in which Dortmund will face Real Madrid, the group said.

Rheinmetall and Dortmund shared ""similar ambitions, attitudes and origins"", the defence firm's CEO Armin Papperger said in the statement.

The partners represented the ""pursuit of excellence and international success"", Papperger added.

New normality

Germany's largest manufacturer of military equipment has seen demand for its products soar in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The advent of the war has seen European governments plough more money into defence in response to the increased Russian threat.

Nowhere has the change in attitudes been more drastic than in Germany, where the government dropped its previously cautious stance and massively increased military spending.

""Security and defence are fundamental cornerstones of our democracy... Especially today, when we see every day how freedom must be defended in Europe,"" Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said in the statement.

""We should deal with this new normality,"" Watzke said, adding that the club was ""consciously opening ourselves up to a dialogue"" on the issue.

The decision to accept the sponsorship deal with Rheinmetall -- worth a ""single-digit-million"" euro sum per year -- was hotly debated within the club, according to the German financial daily Handelsblatt.

Team officials were aware of the potential risks of signing the agreement with the arms company, it reported.

News of the deal sparked outrage in some quarters.

The far-left Linke party demanded an end to the sponsorship, with the group's spokesman on sports affairs telling the Funke newspaper group that it was ""simply unthinkable for a Champions League finalist to be appearing in stadiums in future for an armaments company"".

Amnesty International also joined in, saying that ""sports should not be used to whitewash the poor human rights records of companies.""

Russia's invasion has however seen many Germans reevaluate their attitudes towards defence and towards Russia -- including in the world of sport.

Dortmund's big local rivals Schalke, who currently play in the second division of German football, dropped a sponsorship deal with Russian state energy firm Gazprom after the start of the war in 2022.

In August 2021, six months before the invasion of Ukraine, the proportion who favored a good living standard had reached a historic high of 66 percent, against 32 percent who preferred great-power status (see figure 3).

These findings point to the emergence of what might be called a postimperial Navalny constituency in Russian society: a younger, more globalized, mainly urban segment of the population that was growing year on year and wanted Russia to be a postimperial, normal country. If these trends had continued for another generation, they would have posed a threat to the Putin regime.

Russian exceptionalism and the threat of the West are useful weapons in this domestic battle. Political scientist Kirill Rogov has pointed out that Putin's popularity has peaked roughly every seven years as a result of a military campaign: in 2000 after he launched the war in Chechnya, in 2008 with the war in Georgia, and in 2015 after the annexation of Crimea. In each case, his ratings declined after cresting a wave.

An even bigger foreign military adventure in 2022 enabled Putin to silence dissenting voices or force them into exile to rally the population around the flag and reconsolidate public support, which, the regime feared, was gradually dissipating. By making the war in Ukraine an existential issue for Russia and, by implication, his own regime, Putin was thereby also seeking to save himself.

Elite Compacts

If the need for regime survival is key to Putin's aggression in Ukraine, it casts Russia's relations with its other post-Soviet neighbors in a more instrumentalist light. Regime type and elites' Soviet backgrounds are fairly good predictors of whether Moscow still deems a country to be a reliable partner.

Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are one-party states. Many of their leaders are either former Soviet cadres or of an age that they were raised and educated in the Soviet Union. Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, and Tokayev are both graduates of elite Moscow universities.

Since the war in Ukraine, these leaders have adopted a two-prong survival strategy. They have reduced their security dependence on Russia and asked for and received international legitimation of their countries' sovereignty. At the same time, they have looked to forge elite-to-elite compacts with Moscow that provide guarantees of regime preservation. It is indicative that while Russia did not intervene in Central Asia in 2010 or 2022 when interethnic conflict was costing lives, it did intervene in Kazakhstan in January 2022 to support Tokayev's rule there.

Autocratic leaders seem to know where Russia's redlines are. Institutional collaboration with the EU or NATO -- as opposed to ad hoc partnerships on certain issues -- seems to be one limit not to be crossed. Another demand is that leaders demonstrate respect for the Russian language -- not so hard when they are all fluent Russian speakers. Thus, Aliyev makes the fact that there are more than 300 Russian-language schools in Azerbaijan a regular talking point with his Russian counterpart and told Putin in 2022 that the Russian language is ""a very important basis of our relations and future ties."" Tokayev made headlines in November 2023 by speaking Kazakh, not Russian, at a public meeting with Putin. A month earlier, however, an intergovernmental meeting in Kyrgyzstan inaugurated the International Organization for the Russian Language, which Tokayev had personally promoted.

These autocratic leaders share with the Putin regime a fear of a variation of the Arab Spring revolts that began in 2010 or a color revolution, a popular democratic uprising supported by Western pro-democracy nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Elites use the name ""Soros"" -- in reference to billionaire philanthropist George Soros -- as a shorthand for Western-inspired regime change or the instigation of disorder, even in democratic Georgia or countries where Soros's Open Society Foundations were long ago forced to shut down their activities, such as Uzbekistan.

Aliyev spelled this fear out at length in a February 2022 speech to a youth forum in Baku. He warned young people that they were the targets of ""globalists, or I provisionally call them 'Sorosians,' [with] a destructive mission -- to stir up the youth against their state."" Aliyev listed Western NGOs, among them Amnesty International and Freedom House, and media outlets, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, which, he said, had plotted to depose him. ""And in all of them Armenians play a leading role,"" he added. Aliyev went on to name ""Soros and the organizations he controls.""

In countering these threats, whether real or imagined, it is easy for these autocratic rulers to find common cause with Russia, which will never criticize the conduct of elections and -- as long as the regimes do not cross Moscow's redlines -- will not foment regime change.

Contrast this approach with Russia's relations with the leaders of Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine -- Nikol Pashinyan, Maia Sandu, and Volodymyr Zelensky -- who were all born in the 1970s, too late to be adults in the Soviet Union; received a different education; have a different outlook on the world; and have few or no connections in Russia. Having been democratically elected, these three base their legitimacy on a European-style people's mandate.

Both Pashinyan and Sandu are making bids to emancipate their countries from their dependence on Russia and are turning to the EU and the United States for support. Despite many similarities in terms of size, income level, and democratic standards, Moldova is in a more advantageous position than Armenia in this regard thanks to its geographic location adjacent to the EU. In response, Russia uses a range of instruments, from intervening in domestic politics to threatening to raise the price of its gas exports.

In trying to tilt both Armenia and Moldova back toward Russia and away from the West, the Russian government faces a dilemma, however. As public opinion in both countries is increasingly negative toward Russia, punitive measures, such as restricting trade or raising Armenia's gas price, risk further alienating the public and delivering a message of Russian power that may only play to the advantage of pro-Western politicians.

Georgia forms a strange hybrid case that belongs to neither of these two groups. The country is formally committed under its constitution to join the EU and NATO, and much of its professional elite is post-Soviet and Western educated. However, either from a fear of Russia or in collusion with it -- or, perhaps, both -- the governing Georgian Dream party has conspicuously failed to offer public support to Ukraine since 2022, and its political-business elite keeps many informal links with Russia. These maneuvers enabled the Georgian government to pull off the remarkable feat in 2023 of both moving closer to Russia and being granted candidate country status by the EU. In 2024, that balancing act was failing: by cracking down on dissent and pro-European protestors, the Georgian government seemed to prioritize the quiet approval of Russia over the objections of Western countries.

Multiple Neighborhoods

Geography is a crucial factor in the calculations of leaders who are recalibrating their relations with Russia. More than thirty years after the end of the Soviet Union, despite the continued assumptions of the Russian elite -- and, occasionally, some Western headline writers who should know better -- in labeling them ""Russia's backyard,"" all of these countries can be said to live in multiple neighborhoods. History has returned over the last three decades, so that neighboring powers, such as China, Turkey, Romania, and Poland, are now as influential as, or sometimes more influential than, Russia.

In Central Asia, China is the other main actor. The countries in the region can hedge by building relations with Beijing, but Russia's relationship with China is not necessarily adversarial. Experts on Central Asia caution against the notion that Beijing and Moscow are in conflict there. Alexander Gabuev and Temur Umarov have written that the two powers' economic interests in the region are complementary and that ""Moscow has come to view China's gradually growing security presence not as a competitive challenge but as an opportunity for burden sharing.""

In this context, the South Caucasus is once again what it has been for much of its history: a geopolitical crossroads where no one outside power has decisive influence. Throughout the region, Russia vies for influence with the EU, China, and Turkey. Moscow has acknowledged the emergence of Azerbaijan as the most powerful actor in the South Caucasus. Russia and Azerbaijan signed a partnership agreement in February 2022 shortly before the war in Ukraine began, but the accord is less significant to Baku than is Azerbaijan's strong alliance with Turkey, which was confirmed in a treaty signed in 2021.

Russia now bids to be a less formal third member in this strong Azerbaijan-Turkey axis. Moscow and Ankara have a centuries-old history of contestation in the region, but they also have shared interests. With the South Caucasian trio, Russia, Turkey, and Iran have invested in a new regional 3+3 format, through which all three can pursue an agenda to limit Western influence in the region. Political scientist SeÃ§kin KÃ¶stem has called their relationship ""managed regional rivalry.""

The EU is also a player in the neighborhood. In 2022-2023, Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia were given an EU membership perspective through candidate country status, something that would have been almost unthinkable before the war in Ukraine. There is even talk of Armenia being given such a perspective. In 2023, the EU deployed its first ever civilian monitoring mission to Armenia, a country that is a former Russian military ally.

The EU is challenging Russian energy monopolies, too. The war in Ukraine has seen the coming of age of the EU's Energy Community, an organization in force since 2006 in which Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine are members and Armenia is an observer. The community was founded with the explicit intention to gradually extend the body of EU law on energy, the environment, and climate to participating countries. In 2022, the EU had the instruments in place to help both Moldova and Ukraine begin fairly rapidly to shed their dependence on Russian gas. Armenia and Georgia are more vulnerable in this regard, with Armenia still depending on Russia for around 85 percent of its gas, which is shipped via Georgia.

Contestation over energy and transportation routes between the EU and Russia has intensified in the countries in the South Caucasus and Central Asia. Kazakhstan is vulnerable to Russia in that its main oil export route, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which exports 79 percent of the country's main asset -- crude oil -- runs through Russian territory, and Russia has demonstrated since 2022 that it is prepared to shut the pipeline down. Rerouting oil across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan is expensive and logistically challenging.

Azerbaijan and Georgia are better positioned and have used the post-2022 international environment to benefit economically from both Russia and Europe. In 2023, Azerbaijan struck a deal with the European Commission to double its gas exports to the EU by 2030 as Baku sought to wean itself off its dependence on Russian gas. It was a pledge that energy experts subsequently described as very difficult to meet but that earned Aliyev the compliment from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that Azerbaijan was a ""crucial partner.""

Simultaneously, Azerbaijan continued to work with Russia. In the winter of 2022-2023, Russian energy giant Gazprom sold gas to Azerbaijan to make up for shortfalls in Azerbaijani supply. In October 2023, Russian oil company Lukoil struck an agreement with Azerbaijan's state oil and gas company, SOCAR, under which Lukoil lent the Azerbaijani firm $1.5 billion and pledged to supply SOCAR's STAR oil refinery in Turkey with up to 200,000 barrels per day of Russian crude oil.

Russia badly needs new transportation and connectivity routes. With Western trade links cut off, routes south into the South Caucasus, east into Central Asia, and onward to the Middle East and the rest of Asia have become much more important. Ruslan Davydov, the head of the Russian Customs Service, said in October 2023, ""The main challenge for our customs service was to support the economy to withstand sanctions and facilitate a global pivot of our external trade from the west to the east and south.""

Meanwhile, the Georgian government has exploited this situation to renew flights to and increase trade with Russia -- to the frustration of Georgia's Western partners. And rail traffic through Azerbaijan has increased such that in March 2024, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that volumes through the Russia-Azerbaijan border crossing had increased fivefold. These examples are part of a wider picture in which Russia's southern and eastern post-Soviet neighbors are benefiting from doing business with both Russia and the West.

A Wartime Economy Brings Neighbors Closer

Conflict in Ukraine has reshaped the economic relationships between Russia and its neighbors to their advantage. While frontline states have reasons to be more fearful of Russia in 2024 than before, they are also benefiting economically from a situation in which they are exempt from Western sanctions and have therefore become key states for trade and reexport to Russia.

In this context, the EAEU has been given an unexpected new lease on life. Russia's geopolitical and business interests converged in the creation of an economic union in which the country was responsible for 87 percent of the organization's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 and which precluded the other member states -- Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan -- from signing free-trade agreements with other trading blocs, such as the EU. In return, the other states received low trade tariffs, free movement of labor, and other economic inducements, including a low gas price from Moscow.

Armenia was both a key battleground and an example to others in Russia's efforts to create a privileged economic space in the near abroad. In the 2000s, Russia had acquired almost all of Armenia's main economic resources. Despite this, in 2013, then Armenian president Serzh Sargsyan was on the verge of signing an Association Agreement with the EU that included a large trade component, a Deep and Comprehensive Free-Trade Area. This accord would inevitably have reduced Russia's grip on the Armenian economy. Then, two years of work with the EU were abruptly abandoned as Sargsyan announced that he would join Russia's EAEU instead. Sargsyan barely hid the fact that he did so under coercion from Moscow, saying that Armenia's core security interests were at stake.

A much bigger prize eluded Russia in 2013, however, in Ukraine. Then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych was also negotiating an EU Association Agreement. But unlike in Armenia, his decision to backtrack from the agreement triggered popular protests, which became known as the Euromaidan and eventually led to his downfall. At the time, Putin cited Ukraine's potential NATO membership as a reason for threatening the country and seizing Crimea. In fact, NATO membership for Ukraine was not an imminent prospect. The huge economic impact of the conflict that followed -- the billions of dollars of missed opportunities that Russian businesses suffered in Ukraine when the country failed to join the EAEU in 2013 -- is often overlooked.

Immediately after Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the EAEU looked unfit for purpose. In March, Russia unilaterally announced a ban on exports of grain and sugar to other EAEU member states -- a drastic measure that it later softened. Subsequently, the picture changed as Russia looked to neighboring countries to help it overcome its new isolation. The EAEU as well as the CIS were refashioned as more informal deal-making organizations. A May 2023 leaders' meeting in Moscow drew a strong turnout, being attended not only by the EAEU leaders but also by the president of Azerbaijan in person and the presidents of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan online.

The countries in the South Caucasus and Central Asia have all enjoyed an economic boom as a result of the war in Ukraine. Reexports of goods to Russia, including dual-use goods that could be adapted for military purposes, have burgeoned. For example, Kyrgyzstan has reported a massive increase in car imports from various countries since 2022, including a 5,500 percent increase in imports of German cars and vehicle parts -- presumably for reexport to Russia. The three countries in the South Caucasus have all registered similar dramatic rises in imports of European cars.

As a result, Armenia's GDP in 2024 is close to double what it was in 2021, having risen from $13.8 billion to $26.9 billion according to calculations by the International Monetary Fund. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan have all recorded healthy levels of economic growth. South Caucasian and Central Asian countries have also benefited economically from an influx of educated Russians, many of them relocating their businesses. Armenia and Kazakhstan were especially attractive destinations as migrants could maintain their bank cards and transactions with Russia under EAEU rules. In parallel, Central Asian migrant workers were needed more than ever in Russia to fill the jobs left by departing Russians and young men called up into the army.

These increased business links, many of which exploit loopholes or gaps in Western sanctions policies, have empowered middlemen, who are often ethnic nationals of South Caucasian or Central Asian countries and resident in Russia. One of them is former Georgian general prosecutor Otar Partskhaladze, who was sanctioned by the United States in September 2023 along with business associates who are close to both Russian elite circles and the Georgian Dream government. Another such middleman is Armenian-Russian tycoon Samvel Karapetyan, whose Tashir Group works closely with Gazprom and owns major energy assets in Armenia.

The group of elite Russian-Azerbaijanis who act as trusted intermediaries between Moscow and Baku is even more numerous. One prominent figure is God Nisanov, most famous for owning the Ukraine Hotel and the massive Food City produce markets. He is said to be friends with Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin and close to Aliyev and his family.

Western sanctions on Russian oil and gas have also been a boon for so-called petro-elites, who work between Russia, Central Asia, and Azerbaijan. Even before the war in Ukraine, Russia expert Morena Skalamera wrote that there was a shared interest among the Eurasian petro-economies in cooperating to perpetuate revenues for the elites and resist a shift away from fossil fuels: ""In Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, most natural resources and heavy industries remain controlled by an oligarchy of neftyaniki [oilmen] that still wields strong political influence and retains close business ties with Russian elites and insiders.""

For example, Uzbekistan is set to increase its imports of Russian gas, and cooperation with Russian energy companies has intensified. In Kazakhstan, Moscow's relations with the regime and family of former president Nursultan Nazarbayev were close until they fell out of favor in 2022. Under the Tokayev administration, Kazakh-Russian ""energy interdependence is growing,"" wrote political risk expert Kate Mallinson, while his government has struck several deals with Russia for uranium and coal.

Azerbaijan's petro-elite works more closely with Western companies but still keeps many connections with Russia. Senior Azerbaijani oil and gas managers who are Russian citizens include Gazprom's Famil Sadygov and Lukoil's Vagit Alekperov. According to a Wall Street Journal investigation, after Western companies withdrew from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil company Rosneft's oil trade was taken over by a group of Russian Azerbaijanis operating out of Dubai and Hong Kong. Given that petro-elites are close to or indistinguishable from political elites, it is likely that most or all of these business deals were negotiated at the highest level.

The increased economic cooperation between Russia and its neighbors is lucrative -- but also fragile and contingent on international political developments. New rounds of Western sanctions could threaten the livelihoods of Eurasian middlemen or shut down certain types of trade with Russia. A downturn in the Russian economy could very negatively affect migrant workers in Russia and Russian professional migrants in countries such as Armenia and Kazakhstan. In other words, a fresh crisis and a new round of bargaining between Moscow and its neighbors are possible at any moment.

Conclusion

Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made all of its other neighbors feel deeply insecure. The decision to attack a sovereign state, accompanied by a menacing neo-imperialist discourse from Russian officials and commentators, sent the other post-Soviet states the message that they also belonged to a sphere of Russian influence and had no right to determine their own futures.

The war has simultaneously made Russia more threatening, weaker, and more unpredictable. In 2022, Russia intervened militarily in Ukraine yet also declined to do so in two disputes in Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Pressed by a host of day-to-day preoccupations, the Putin regime no longer pretends to have an overarching regional security strategy. Instead, with multilateral organizations such as the UN and the OSCE also weaker, the trend is toward an ad hoc regionalization of security arrangements as other regional powers, such as China, Iran, and Turkey, assert their interests and may seek to cut deals with Russia over the heads of the countries concerned. It is more a gangland environment than a post-Russia order.

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine marked the end of three decades of softer Russian post-Soviet integration projects, which were encapsulated in the term ""near abroad."" One reason why Putin resorted to mass violence is because his integration projects to create a Russia-centered belt of states had not worked out as planned.

The invasion was not inevitable. Much of Russia's elite is afflicted by an imperial mindset, but the country's personalized autocracy is arguably more consequential. During Russia's first two post-Soviet decades, other more conciliatory options on how to engage with its neighborhood had been part of the mainstream political discourse. Putin's war was intended to legitimize his own autocratic rule by extinguishing alternative visions of a postimperial Russia, which would have promised more freedom not only for Russia's neighbors but also for Russian citizens.

In a highly uncertain environment and a potential security vacuum, the other post-Soviet states continue to do political and economic deals with Russia. Economic cooperation between the South Caucasus and Central Asian states, on the one hand, and Moscow, on the other, has increased in the past two years, as these countries provide alternative trade routes for Russia, which suffers from a Western economic blockade. Their economies have all grown since 2022.

To use the language of political science, regime type matters. The one-party autocratic governments in Central Asia and Azerbaijan have adapted best to the volatile post-2022 situation. A long Soviet legacy is no less palpable there than in Russia. The leaders of these countries have made their republics bastions of sovereignty and are generally averse to power sharing not only within their societies but also with their regional neighbors.

These leaders have reached out to Western governments and received new attention from them. That attention is warranted. Yet, most of these leaders are cut from the same Soviet cloth as the Russian elite, and their regimes bear a strong resemblance to Putin's. They have studied or worked in Russia and speak the same language as the Putin regime, both literally and figuratively. Their petro-elites continue to do oil and gas deals with Russian companies. While also reaching out to Western powers and China, these leaders let the Putin regime understand that they will not cross Russian redlines by embracing democracy or seeking EU or NATO membership. In this respect, the leaders are often out of step with their societies, where the mood of alienation from Russia is stronger.

With these one-party states, European actors should pursue policies that reinforce their sovereignty and enable them to decrease their dependence on Russia. But Europeans should be careful in the process not to strengthen undemocratic elites who still work closely with Moscow and are instrumentalizing Russia's war in Ukraine to their advantage.

Three other countries -- Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova -- have many differences but share the fact that they are democracies and more vulnerable to Russia. There, Western actors have more opportunities to provide direct security assistance, work with societies, and strengthen democratic institutions. But this is likely to be successful only if there is seen to be evidence of a serious long-term commitment. EU accession promises this, but the way ahead is not so clear to many citizens. These three countries also have divided societies, and it is important to engage with those constituencies that, for economic, cultural, or religious reasons, are still linked to Russia.

For the foreseeable future, Russia's neighbors can only expect the unexpected. This is especially true as all consequential decisions are being made by one man -- Putin -- and any checks and balances have been removed. If the Russian leader decides to take action in the near abroad, however unwise other state actors in Russia deem it to be, there is very little to stop him. Dealing with the threats and uncertainties that the new Russia presents requires from others both short-term agility and a long-term investment of resources.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares to visit China on May 16-17, 2024, the proposed Power of Siberia 2 (PS-2) natural gas pipeline is likely high on his agenda. After all, Russian energy exports to Europe have fallen precipitously since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with pipeline gas and oil flows to Europe declining by more than 80 percent and coal exports by nearly 100 percent. Although Russia has been able to redirect most of its oil and coal exports to other markets, it has been unable to do so with natural gas due to a lack of infrastructure linking its western production basins to consumers in Asia (Figure 1).[i]

PS-2, with its 50 billion cubic meters per year (bcm/y) design capacity, could offset nearly half of the decline in Russian pipeline gas export to the EU between 2021 and 2023. While the Kremlin has made no secret of its eagerness to expedite the project,[ii] its fate remains uncertain, largely because China has refrained from committing to it.

This commentary explores the future of PS-2 through an analysis of the broader China-Russia energy relationship and the Russian and Chinese positions on the project. It also examines implications of the pipeline's potential completion for global gas markets. The piece contends that despite Russia's intentions, PS-2 has made limited progress because China currently stands to benefit from keeping the project in a holding pattern. But if China can secure an attractive price for PS-2 gas, and if China's relations with the United States continue to deteriorate, Beijing could be motivated to reverse course. The completion of PS-2, if it happens, would likely therefore be on China's terms, and could reshape global gas markets in important ways.

The China-Russia Energy Relationship

The China-Russia energy trade relationship was sizeable before Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has grown even larger since. In 2021-23, Russian crude oil exports to China increased by one-third, while coal and LNG exports nearly doubled (Figure 2). In 2023, Russia was China's largest supplier of crude oil, second-largest supplier of coal, and third-largest supplier of LNG. Russia is also a growing exporter of pipeline gas to China. It increased deliveries through the Power of Siberia 1 (PS-1) pipeline from 10.4 bcm in 2021 to 22.7 bcm in 2023, accounting for 34 percent of China's pipeline gas imports.[iii] Russia expects PS-1 to reach its full 38 bcm/y capacity by 2025.[iv] Additionally, China and Russia signed an agreement in early February 2022 for another pipeline, the Far Eastern Route, to deliver 10 bcm/y by 2027.[v]

The Russian Perspective

Russia regards the loss of the European market as irreversible.[vi] While the Kremlin understands that expanded bilateral gas trade with China will never fully compensate for the loss of gas export revenues from Europe, [vii] and will naturally increase Russia's dependence on China,[viii] it continues to prioritize PS-2 for several reasons.

Geopolitics

When it comes to natural gas exports, geopolitics is the foremost consideration for Russia. Moscow regards gas as a potent tool in its dealings with counterparties across Eurasia. Until the 2010s, gas was widely used as ""geopolitical currency"" in the post-Soviet space: Russia offered gas at below-market rates in exchange for geopolitical alignment or control over critical energy infrastructure.[ix]

A similar calculation is likely at play with PS-2. By selling large volumes of cheap gas to China, Russia can potentially tie Beijing into a closer geopolitical alliance. Russia's bargaining power with China is much weaker than it was with its former satellite states in previous decades, however. Convincing China to commit to such a large project during the war would be a geopolitical coup for Moscow, demonstrating to the West and the Global South that it is able to deepen its energy relationship with China despite the war.

The Economy

PS-2 would most likely be less profitable than PS-1, due to its higher construction cost and the lower expected sales price of gas to China.[x] However, the pipeline is expected to generate a positive free cash flow of $2.5-$4.3 billion per year (compared with about $20 billion for PS-1).[xi] The project would also generate orders for Russia's steel producers and subcontractors and accelerate the economic development of eastern Russia,[xii] a top priority for Moscow.[xiii]

Russia is preparing for a long period of international isolation and transitioning to a wartime economy,[xiv] which supports large-scale, state-funded infrastructure projects. PS-2 could be one such flagship project, simultaneously marking Russia's decisive breakup with the West and its pivot to the East. Russia's indication in December 2023 that it was prepared to start building PS-2 without a supply contract underscores that the economic benefits associated with the project go far beyond the sale of gas molecules.[xv]

Gazprom's Viability

Gazprom, Russia's state-owned pipeline monopoly, has its own reasons for championing PS-2 that dovetail with those of the Kremlin. In 2023, Gazprom suffered a collapse in gas revenues, leading to a staggering $6.8 billion net loss -- the company's first annual loss since 1999.[xvi] On top of its recent financial woes, the company has no large-scale infrastructure projects planned aside from PS-2 and the stalled Baltic LNG terminal.[xvii] The PS-2 project therefore poses an existential challenge to Gazprom: completing it can reaffirm its role as Russia's natural gas champion; failing to do so could jeopardize the company's very existence, with its assets potentially being divided among various elite groups inside Russia.

Gazprom's main domestic rival, Rosneft, has been seeking to challenge Gazprom's monopoly over gas export in Russia. In 2014, Rosneft tried to connect to PS-1, but Gazprom was able to retain full control over the pipeline's capacity, despite Rosneft's political heft. In 2023, Rosneft's CEO repeated arguments from a decade before for allowing the company to use PS-2: the ability to monetize 8 bcm/y of associated gas in Eastern Siberia, the prospect of unlocking additional oil production in the region, and the possibility of reducing gas flaring and reinjection volumes.[xviii] Rosneft is still seeking to secure access, though it faces long odds. Nonetheless, the company is closely monitoring Gazprom for any mistakes that can sway Russian decision-makers to change course.

The Chinese Perspective

China has the luxury of time when it comes to PS-2 because it does not need the gas right away. Moreover, China is spoiled for choice in its supply options. As Beijing assesses whether and how PS-2 fits into its future import portfolio, its considerations almost certainly will include the following factors.

Projected Imports

One reason China is in no hurry to finalize an agreement for PS-2 is that the country is unlikely to need the gas before the mid-2030s. Projections of China's natural gas balance indicate that imports will reach around 250 bcm by 2030 (from less than 170 bcm in 2023),[xix] which largely (or entirely) can be met by already contracted supplies (Figure 3). Reference case projections also show, however, that there will most likely be room for PS-2 in China's import portfolio by 2040. In that year, China's gas imports could approach (or exceed) 300 bcm, with only 150 bcm covered by existing contracts.

Source: Authors' analysis based on CNPC ETRI 2060 World and China Energy Outlook (2022 Edition), Sinopec China Energy Outlook 2060 (2024 Edition), CNOOC Energy Outlook 2060 (2023), Shell LNG Outlook 2024, BP Energy Outlook 2023 (New Momentum scenario), EIA International Energy Outlook 2023, and S&P Global Commodity Insights (Liquefaction Projects and Contracts Data, March 8, 2024).[xx]

PS-2 faces competition nonetheless. China's LNG import capacity is set to increase from 144 to 250 bcm/y between 2022 and 2027.[xxi] This will allow China to absorb the 85 bcm/y of new LNG supply contracted in 2021-23 -- and to ink new agreements.[xxii] China could also increase pipeline imports from Central Asia via the stalled Line D project, which could deliver an additional 30 bcm/y from Turkmenistan if completed.

Price

If China moves forward with PS-2, it will look to secure a lower price for PS-2 gas than it secured for PS-1 gas, since it is in an even stronger negotiating position with Russia than it was in 2014 when the supply contract for PS-1 was signed. China customs data from December 2019 through December 2021 show that PS-1 gas was cheaper than China's other pipeline gas and LNG imports (Figure 4).[xxiii]

LNG prices will probably also factor into China's PS-2 calculus. Sinopec noted in its long-term energy outlook that a likely increase in future LNG prices may necessitate the development of new import pipelines.[xxiv]

Bargaining Power

Slow-walking PS-2 also gives China's importers leverage in contract negotiations with Russia and other suppliers; the discussions themselves put pressure on suppliers to sign contracts or risk losing a share of China's natural gas imports. Indeed, as those discussions have unfolded, Chinese companies have signed new LNG supply contracts, including three 27-year deals with Qatar.[xxv] Moreover, in May 2023, China's leader Xi Jinping told Central Asian leaders that construction of Line D should be expedited.[xxvi] These moves are reminders to Russia that China is pursuing other options to meet its import requirements.

Supply Security

The fate of PS-2 will partly depend on Beijing's assessment of the relative risks of greater dependence on Russian pipeline gas versus greater dependence on LNG imports. PS-2 would increase Russia's pipeline capacity to China to 98 bcm/y. If this capacity is built and fully utilized by 2030, China's net import dependence on Russian pipeline gas could reach 40 percent by 2030, on par with the EU's dependence before Russia invaded Ukraine (Figure 5).

On the other hand, China's reliance on LNG would almost certainly increase without PS-2. Chinese analysts have identified overreliance on US and Australian LNG as a vulnerability for China, which can be mitigated by growing gas imports from Russia.[xxvii] Indeed, as mentioned previously, it seems likely that a prolonged deterioration in the US-China relationship would prompt Beijing to look more favorably upon PS-2.[xxviii]

Implications for Global Gas Markets

PS-2 would have profound implications for global gas trade. The project would bring up to 50 bcm/y of stranded Russian gas to the global market by displacing LNG in China's import portfolio. For comparison, this volume is greater than Russia's total LNG exports (43 bcm) and slightly less than Africa's total LNG production (56 bcm) in 2023.[xxix]

Prolonging the Global LNG Glut

If PS-2 starts deliveries by 2030, as Gazprom's current plans suggest,[xxx] the extra gas from Russia would likely arrive in a market still coping with excess supply from the latest wave of LNG investment. Between 2024 and 2030, close to 300 bcm/y of new LNG export capacity could start operations.[xxxi] Most analysts maintain that this unprecedented supply wave will push the market into oversupply from 2025-26 until the late 2020s or early 2030s. China is expected to absorb much of the surplus.[xxxii] PS-2 could exacerbate this glut by weakening China's LNG appetite.

Weakening Russia's LNG Ambitions

There is a tension between PS-2 and Russia's plans to more than triple LNG exports by 2030 (to 100 million tons per annum or 136 bcm).[xxxiii] Facing Western sanctions and possibly EU LNG import bans, Russia is increasingly reliant on Chinese equipment, financing, shipbuilding, and LNG offtake. China would likely have to reduce its LNG imports to make room for PS-2 gas, removing an obvious destination for incremental Russian LNG supply. Without a concerted effort to create additional demand for Russian LNG in emerging economies (potentially by offering affordable LNG to the Global South at a modest profit in exchange for geopolitical influence),[xxxiv] PS-2 would call into question the viability of Russia's planned LNG projects.

Reinforcing China's Role in LNG Trading

PS-2 could also turbo-charge the emergence of Chinese LNG importers as global traders.[xxxv] Adding 50 bcm/y of pipeline gas to China's import portfolio would force Chinese companies to be even more agile in their optimization of import flows, especially contracted LNG. This could entail greater reloading capabilities within China, joint LNG optimization schemes with other importers, and reserving LNG regasification capacity in overseas terminals. A long position in LNG following the ramp-up of PS-2 and a more prominent role in global LNG trading could reinforce China's role as a global LNG market balancer in the 2030s, with far-reaching consequences for LNG trade flows, market liquidity, and energy geopolitics.

Conclusion

China has been content to keep PS-2 on the drawing board for now, affording it time to assess its post-2030 import needs, including the balance between pipeline and LNG imports. But certain geopolitical considerations for both China and Russia could propel the project toward completion, even if China has no immediate need for additional pipeline gas. Russia's push for the project has been driven by noncommercial factors all along. For China, the price of gas and overreliance on a single supplier have been the primary concerns until now, but worsening relations with the US could lend additional support for PS-2. If and when the project is built, it likely will be on China's terms -- and it may well reshape the global gas market.

After the death of Alexei Navalny in late February, The New York Times ran an article quoting from William F. Browder, ""an American-born British financier who has campaigned against human-rights abuses in Russia,"" who said that ""Aleksei Navalny is a globally recognized and beloved individual who was snuffed out by a killer. This is a classic good-versus-evil story. These types of symbols and stories have a resonance that goes so far beyond the petty squabbles of the world we live in.""

Browder cited as precedent for Navalny's death the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky, Browder's ""lawyer and auditor who died in a Moscow jail cell under suspicious circumstances.""

After Magnitsky died, Browder had campaigned for countries' to pass laws that would blacklist Russia for human-rights violations. The European Union was the ""most reluctant,"" according to Browder, though ""adopted the legislation after Mr. Navalny suffered near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent in 2020.""

According to Browder, Navalny is a Russian equivalent of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

His death would ""make it politically untenable for American lawmakers to be viewed as accommodating Mr. Putin, making it harder for at least some Republicans in Congress to hold up additional military aid to Ukraine,"" which Browder long championed.

For years now, Browder has been presented in The New York Times and other mainstream U.S. media outlets as a great human rights crusader determined to stand up against evil.

The grandson of Earl Browder, the former chairman of the Communist Party USA, he has been a key driver behind U.S. policies towards Russia in the new Cold War as a media gadfly sought out for his alleged expertise on Russia, and lobbyist for hard-line anti-Putin policies.

Browder has contributed to the political campaigns of Russia hawks like Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) through Ziff Brothers, a firm associated with Hermitage Capital, a multi-million dollar hedge-fund that Browder operated in Russia during the 1990s and early 2000s before he fell afoul of the Putin government.

Is Browder Credible?

In 2013, Browder was found guilty in a Russian court of failing to pay 552 million rubles in taxes ($16 million) and illegally buying up shares of Gazprom for which he was sentenced in absentia to nine years in prison.

Browder accused the Russian government of perpetrating a $230 million scam in 2009 to takeover his company, Hermitage Capital, though a film that has been blacklisted in the U.S. by Andrei Nekrasov and written by Torstein Grude, The Magnitsky Act: Behind the Scenes (2016), and a book by Alex Krainer, Grand Deception: The Browder Hoax (2017), revealed serious inconsistencies in Browder's story.

Notable among these inconsistencies is the fact that Magnitsky was not actually a lawyer but a tax accountant, as Browder admitted under oath, and that he was not hired by Browder after his company was scammed as Browder has claimed.

Magnitsky was rather hired to set up an offshore structure that Russian investigators would later say was used for tax evasion and illegal share purchases by Hermitage.

According to Nekrasov's investigation, Magnitsky was an expert in ""circumventing the laws and regulations"" which required foreigners like Browder to pay more for business and stock shares.

Russian-language transcripts of Magnitsky's interviews with police show that Magnitsky never actually accused anyone of malfeasance and was not a whistle-blower but was questioned by police about tax evasion practices Browder's firm had been accused of beginning in 2004.

At the time of Magnitsky's arrest, Browder never discussed his case or assisted in his defense, and Hermitage never had any mention of it on its website, turning Magnitsky into a martyr only after he died.

The U.S. embassy also did not raise any public concerns or outcry in the crucial period that Magnitsky was in prison, raising questions as to why they only spotlighted the case after his death. When I tried to pose this question to Ambassador John Beyrle, he refused to answer, as did later ambassador Michael McFaul, another key Russia hawk and driver of U.S. Cold War policies.

Mr. Nekrasov told me in an interview that he spoke off-the-record with a Doctor Kratov from the Butyrka prison, who was indicted and put on trial in Russia for negligence in his treatment of Magnitsky, though acquitted.

According to Nekrasov, ""Kratov said that in his personal opinion there was a chance that Magnitsky had indeed been killed (he died of a heart attack officially) but that in that case only Browder and Co. could have been behind it. Theoretically it is possible to organize such a killing from outside a jail in Moscow, even if there is no evidence of it in our case in my view. What is clear however, is that only Browder stood to benefit from Magnitsky's death, while the authorities needed Magnitsky alive, as a witness against Browder.""

Browder was charged by Russian authorities with murder in the death of Magnitsky. The evidence against him was an intercepted communication from Western intelligence agencies which allegedly exposed an Operation called Quake designed to ""start a scandal or significant news trigger to discredit the Russian Federation in the eyes of the international community.""

Operating under the code name ""Agent Solomon,"" Mr. Browder, with Britain's MI-6 and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny (AKA ""Agent Freedom"") is said to have arranged for ""proxies in the Russian federal penitentiary service to arrange the termination of any medical services for Magnitsky."" Similar accusations were previously aired on Russian state television but dismissed by independent analysts because the communication was found to have had spelling errors that derived from flawed Russian translation.

A Capitalist Rebel

Browder's book Red Notice provides fascinating autobiographical detail about how Browder rebelled against his left-wing family by ""putting on a suit and tie and becoming a capitalist.""

After receiving his M.B.A. at Stanford University, Browder worked for the investment banking firm Salmon Brothers, where he turned a $25 million investment in privatization vouchers in Russia distributed after the fall of the Soviet Union into a $125 million stock portfolio.

Browder then started up his own investment firm, Hermitage Capital, with help from Syrian-Israeli banker Edmond Safra, an owner of the Republican National Bank of New York which had sold tens of billions of dollars in U.S. dollar notes to corrupt Russian banks, who also profited from the privatization voucher scheme.

Helping to launder funds from the illicit sale of arms and drugs by CIA operatives in the 1980s Iran-Contra affair, Mr. Safra died under suspicious circumstances after selling shares of Hermitage to HSBC in 1999. According to a New York Times profile, Safra taught Browder ""not to shy away from kicking up a scandal to protect his interests.""

By 1997, Hermitage came to manage over $1 billion in assets and was able to withstand a $900 million loss following the Asian financial crisis, in part by adopting a strategy of picking up shares from corrupt firms and attacking corruption in them and helping to reinvigorate them.

According to Times reporter Clifford J. Levy, Browder functioned as ""a foreign version of the Russian oligarchs who earned their fortunes in the mass privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union. He courted publicity.""

Self-Serving Criticism of Putin

Browder's emergence as a leading critic of Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin appears to be entirely self-serving.

Nekrasov's film and Krainer's book suggest that Browder and not the Russian government were behind the $230 million tax scam involving his company, Hermitage, which his lawyer all but admitted to in a book launch gala in London.

In a campaign supported by U.S. and British intelligence, Browder began spreading rumors about Putin in an attempt to delegitimize his criminal prosecution, and because Browder wanted to resume Hermitage's operations' under a new Russian leader that, unlike Putin, kow-towed to foreign business interests.

In Red Notice, Browder claimed that after Mikhail Khodorkovsky's arrest in October, 2003, before he was allegedly about to sell shares of Yukos Oil to Exxon Mobil,, Putin struck a deal with Russia's oligarchs granting them prosecutorial immunity.

In exchange, they allegedly promised to give Putin somewhere between thirty and seventy percent of their wealth. Browder qualifies his assertion by noting that ""he wasn't there"" when Putin brokered this deal so ""he was only speculating.""

In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2016, Browder claimed Putin- -- whom he referred to as a ""criminal dictator not too different from Hitler, Mussolini or Gadhafi"" -- demanded fifty percent and from that point on became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the ""richest man"" in the world.

However, there is no hard evidence to corroborate these allegations and Browder's changing the numbers implies a lack of precision.

Andrei Nekrasov told me that ""there is no evidence of Putin's excessive riches. There is not a single evidence of some bank accounts, or bribe he, or his wife for example, got from an industry, or any such thing. While there is such evidence in the case of quite a few other heads of state [including] evidence in [Boris] Yeltsin's case, quite specific and direct.""

Fake Scholarship

According to Moscow correspondent John Helmer, Browder was the key source for a much touted scholarly book by Karen Dawisha entitled Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? published in 2014 by Simon & Schuster.

Dawisha was then the Walter E. Havighurst Professor of Political Science in the Department of Political Science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and director of the University's Havighurst Center for Russian and Post-Soviet Studies.

Dawisha's editor at Simon & Schuster, Alice Mayhew, had been taking editorial advice from the CIA since James Angleton ran the CIA's counter-intelligence operations against suspected Russian moles, according to John Helmer an Australian Moscow correspondent.

Putin's Kleptocracy argued that corruption and authoritarianism in Russia in recent decades were not byproducts of the country's emergence from communism, but rather building blocks of a plan devised in the early 1990s by Putin and a circle of trusted associates from St. Petersburg, where Putin had served as deputy mayor.

Dawisha wrote that ""the group now in power started out with Putin from the beginning. They are committed to a life of looting without parallel. This kleptocracy is abhorrent not just because of the gap between rich and poor that it has created, but because in order to achieve success this cabal has had to destroy any possibility of freedom.""

Dawisha claimed further that this St. Petersburg cabal, which Putin headed, ""displayed a pattern of uncontrollable greed, of wanting what rightfully belongs to others, which...has resulted in [Putin amassing] over twenty official residences, fifty eight planes and four yachts.""

John Helmer exposes Dawisha as an academic charlatan and fraud in his book, Sovcomplot: How Pirates Tried to Capture the Treasure of the Russian Seas, and Were Caught Out (2023).

Helmer writes that ""Dawisha attempted no analysis of a Russian commercial business or state enterprise except for Gazprom, the state gas producer. Her account of that is entirely based on allegations by William Browder; Dawisha reported none of the Russian or American investigations of Browder's fabrications.""

Dawisha had tried in her book to make Gennady Timchenko, an executive with the Russian shipping company Sovcomplot, one of the linchpins of her case that Putin enriched his friends and cronies from St. Petersburg who in turn enriched Putin.

As an executive with Sovcomplot, Timchenko was accused of involvement in a privatization scheme resulting in the embezzlement of millions of dollars. Dawisha claimed that Timchenko and Putin's ties went back to the St. Petersburg in the early 1990s and that Timchenko secretly gave Putin a 75% stake in a lucrative oil trading firm, allowing him to amass a fortune of $40 billion.

However, Dawisha provides no proof of the allegation, which if true, Helmer said, would have been disclosed in court testimony during a British court case involving Sovcomplot. This case largely exonerated Timchenko and made no mention of Putin, which it would have if Putin was as corrupt as Dawisha and Browder claimed.

Helmer's careful investigation revealed that Putin had no personal involvement in any embezzlement schemes by Sovcomplot executives or their coverup. Putin took a hands-off approach to the company's operations apart from wanting to ensure that the company continued to expand and that it was not completely privatized. Russian authorities also prosecuted corrupt officials when they tried to embezzle money.

According to Helmer, Dawisha and Browder's collaboration in spreading disinformation was undertaken with the purpose of ""justifying, encouraging and expanding the U.S. war for regime change in the Kremlin."" Dawisha's book ""is a case for all the U.S. government policies currently underway"" including the use of force and violence to oust Putin because, as Dawisha put it, ""Putin will not go gentle into the night.""

In the Robber Baron Tradition

John Hobson famously emphasized in his 1902 classic Imperialism how the British empire was driven by financial elites seeking outlets for new investments and who unduly influenced government policy. With regards to the United States, Hobson wrote that ""it is Messrs. Rockefeller, Pierpont Morgan, Hannah, Schwab, and their associates who need imperialism....because they desire to use the public resources of their country to find profitable employment for the capital which otherwise would be superfluous.""

William F. Browder follows in the same tradition in this neoliberal era.

He and his collaborators have been extremely successful in using their wealth and political connections to sway public opinion against Putin by financing anti-Russian politicians and gaining voice in the media, and have in turn helped legitimize the expansion of NATO, the deadly U.S. proxy war in Ukraine, and a new arms race that benefits the military-industrial-petroleum complex.

At one point, Browder called Secretary of State John Kerry -- a lukewarm supporter of the Magnitsky Act -- ""Putin's lapdog"" and purveyor of an ""appeasement policy.""

This kind of poisonous language suggests that Browder is part of a planned political campaign, driven by powerful financial and ""deep state"" interests who profited from the plunder of Russia in the 1990s that Putin put a stop to.

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.

On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.

""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]

The UK Ministry of Defence reported that Gazprom, one of Russia's state-owned energy companies, has reported its biggest annual loss for 25 years. Gazprom's revenues fell by around 30 per cent in 2023, leading to an annual net loss of approximately 629 billion roubles (USD $6.9 billion).

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and subsequent degradation of Russia's relationships with the West, has severely constrained Gazprom's operations. Gazprom's failure to fully re-orientate its exports away from its dependence on European markets will likely continue to restrict its profits until at least 2030. Whilst Gazprom has been able to divert some of its trade to alternative markets, due to infrastructural limitations, these likely only accounted for 5 to 10 per cent of the lost European sales in 2023. It is highly likely that an increase in future sales is reliant on construction of new export infrastructure, such as the 'Power of Siberia 2' gas pipeline.

High taxation on Gazprom's revenues in 2022 and 2023 has almost certainly reduced the ability and incentives for Gazprom to invest in its expansion to alternative markets. In 2023, Gazprom paid an estimated 2.5 trillion roubles (USD $28 billion) to the Russian budget, approximately 9 per cent of total government revenues. The Russian government plans to further increase the tax burden on Gazprom in 2024, which likely contributed to Gazprom's decision to cut its investment for 2024 by around 15 per cent.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that during the day of May 12, there were 146x tactical engagements.

Russian forces launched a total of 6x missile and 57x air strikes, 41x MLRS attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops and various settlements. Unfortunately, the Russian attacks have wounded civilians. Residential apartment blocks and private houses, as well as other civil infrastructure got destroyed and damaged.

Volyn and Polissya axes: no significant changes. No signs of formation of an offensive group.

Russia maintains its military presence in the russian areas bordering Ukrainian Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts. Russia conducts subversion, continues shelling of Ukrainian settlements from the territory of Tussia and increases the concentration of mining operations along the state border of Ukraine. More than 20x settlements, including Uhly, Hrem'yach (Chernihiv oblast), Kindrativka, Zapsillya, Myropillya (Sumy oblast), came under Russian artillery and mortar fire.

Kharkiv axis: Russian forces executed 10x attacks near Luk'yantsi, Hlyboke, Vovchans'k, Buhruvatka (Kharkiv oblast). The Russian adversary carried out air strikes in the vicinities of Hraniv, Lyptsi, Vesele, Neskuchne, Starytsya, Zarichne, Zelenyi Yar, Hontarivka, Tomakhivka, Yurchenkove, Vovchans'k (Kharkiv oblast). More than 20x settlements came under artillery and mortar fire, including Lyptsi, Neskuchne, Starytsya, Vovchans'k (Kharkiv oblast).

Kup'yans'k axis: the Ukrainian defenders repelled 9x attacks in the vicinities of Petropavlivka, Berestove (Kharkiv oblast), Stel'makhivka, Andriivka (Luhansk oblast), where Russian forces attempted to improve its tactical position. The Russian adversary launched an air strike in the vicinity of Ivanivka (Kharkiv oblast).

In the Kharkiv direction, the operating environment remains complex and dynamically changing.

There are fighting in the directions of Pil Ð½Ð°na-LukyancÃ­, Pil ÐÐµna-Deep, Pil ÑÑna - OlÃ­jnikove, Murom-Bugruvatka.

In addition, Russia conducts storm actions in the directions of StrÃ­leÄa - Deep, OlÃ­jnikove - Deep, Olinikove - LukÃ¢ncÃ­, Murom - StaricÃ¢, PltenÃ­vka - Quiet.

At present, Russia has tactical success.

Measures are planned to destroy an enemy who has wiped into Ukrainain defense.

Ukrainain defenders conduct defensive actions, inflict fire on Russian forces, extensively deploy unmanned systems for reconnaissance and mission point strikes to target maximum losses. The deployment of reserves to stabilize the situation is ongoing. In the process of determining tasks to troops, one of the main priorities is to save the lives of Ukrainain soldiers.

It has been a long week. Everyone is, I'm sure worn out. So far, Rosie seems to be tolerating her third chemo treatment much better than her first two. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, kind wishes, and prayers for her. Also, there was a misfire with the GoFundMe. Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know. But I do want anyone who did donate and who is getting a refund to know that I appreciate what you did very, very, very much!

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

9 May 2024 - 20:41

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

Glory to Ukraine!

Two Ukrainian hydroelectric power plants will not be functioning due to damage caused by the Russian missile attack on May 8th - Ukrhydroenergo.

â¡ï¸Germany to buy 3 HIMARS for Ukraine.

Germany will buy three HIMARS multiple rocket launchers for Ukraine, the country's defense minister announced on May 9. Speaking during a trip to Washington, Boris Pistorius said they would be purchased from the U.S. and handed over to Kyiv.

â¡ï¸Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin is strangling Ukraine's economy by knocking out much of its electricity generation and wearing down the civilian population by bombing cities. Kharkiv, which is already rationing electricity, is being hit by glide bombs almost daily. Yet the city of more than 1m people is keeping calm and carrying on. On a sunny afternoon last week, residents strolled through a park and attendants went on emptying rubbish bins, even as two glide bombs landed with huge explosions less than a kilometre away. Keeping the city functioning and clean is a way to stand up to destruction and chaos.

With around 50,000 fresh Russian troops gathering across the border some 40km away, Kharkiv's commanders know they may be a target in Russia's next push. One scenario would be to isolate the city by cutting the main road to Kyiv. Another would be to move some 10km closer, putting the city's eastern outskirts within artillery range and creating a buffer zone to protect Belgorod, a Russian city that is being hit by Ukrainian drones.

Konstantin Nemichev is the commander of the famous Kraken regiment, a special-forces outfit formed in the early days of the invasion in 2022 that defended Kharkiv. He expects the enemy to attack the province again in mid-May, but reckons they will fail to get near the city. Interviewed outside a ruined school building in the east of town, the site of an intense firefight in 2022 in which invading soldiers were wiped out, the commander says the defence is much stronger now. It has three lines of fortifications and a full brigade to stop the Russians. ""They can move a few kilometres into the province,"" he says, ""but I don't think they can get as far as 10km.""

The Ukrainian armed forces know they have no choice but to fight on. ""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region. But this sense of urgency and existential threat, he says, needs to penetrate into the whole of Ukrainian society. ""People need to know the truth,"" he says. And Ukraine needs unity as it enters a new stage of conflict.

I want to reemphasize LTC Tkach's assessment:

""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region.

Those, as well as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and Ukrainians existence as Ukrainians, are the stakes!

Professor Snyder has posted a new explainer of Russian propaganda. From the Thread Reader App:

President Zelenskyy continues to shake up his senior national security team. From The Kyiv Independent:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's State Security Administration (UDO), Serhii Rud, according to a presidential decree published on May 9.

The UDO's main tasks include ensuring the security of the President of Ukraine and high-ranking officials of the state, as well as the protection of administrative buildings and objects of state authorities of Ukraine.

Rud's dismissal comes shortly after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have uncovered a network of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who were plotting to assassinate President Zelensky and other high-ranking officials in Ukraine. Two colonels of the UDO accused of leaking classified information to Russia were reportedly detained.

The FSB network aimed to find perpetrators among the military close to Zelensky's security, ""who could take the head of state hostage and then kill him.""

Just a few weeks before, SBU officials and Polish law enforcement worked to detain a Polish citizen who allegedly offered to Russia to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In late November, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

The Ukrainian president issued several presidential decrees this week mandating changes in senior leadership across Ukraine's government and military.

Dmytro Hereha was reappointed as the commander of Ukraine's Support Forces, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was formally dismissed from military service. Zaluzhnyi will now serve as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.K.

Russian sources are claiming the Mariupol strike was ATACMS:

A video of the drone attacking the plant in Russian Salavat, Bashkiria, appeared on Russian Telegram channels.

The person who is filming says the drone is very large.

It looks like the drone flew about 1,500 km before it reached its target and hit the oiloil catalytic cracking unit.

Gazprom neftekhim Salavat is one of the largest oil refining and petrochemical production complexes in Russia. It specializes in the production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other types of petroleum products.

The new sponsor sparked controversy, with Economy Minister Robert Habeck saying the ""unusual"" sponsor was also a reflection that ""unfortunately we are (now) in another, more threatening world"".

The three-year tie-up includes advertising space at Dortmund's ground and at press conferences, Rheinmetall said in a statement.

Rheinmetall's logo would already appear around the club in the build-up to Saturday's Champions League final at Wembley in which Dortmund will face Real Madrid, the group said.

Rheinmetall and Dortmund shared ""similar ambitions, attitudes and origins"", the defence firm's CEO Armin Papperger said in the statement.

The partners represented the ""pursuit of excellence and international success"", Papperger added.

New normality

Germany's largest manufacturer of military equipment has seen demand for its products soar in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The advent of the war has seen European governments plough more money into defence in response to the increased Russian threat.

Nowhere has the change in attitudes been more drastic than in Germany, where the government dropped its previously cautious stance and massively increased military spending.

""Security and defence are fundamental cornerstones of our democracy... Especially today, when we see every day how freedom must be defended in Europe,"" Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said in the statement.

""We should deal with this new normality,"" Watzke said, adding that the club was ""consciously opening ourselves up to a dialogue"" on the issue.

The decision to accept the sponsorship deal with Rheinmetall -- worth a ""single-digit-million"" euro sum per year -- was hotly debated within the club, according to the German financial daily Handelsblatt.

Team officials were aware of the potential risks of signing the agreement with the arms company, it reported.

News of the deal sparked outrage in some quarters.

The far-left Linke party demanded an end to the sponsorship, with the group's spokesman on sports affairs telling the Funke newspaper group that it was ""simply unthinkable for a Champions League finalist to be appearing in stadiums in future for an armaments company"".

Amnesty International also joined in, saying that ""sports should not be used to whitewash the poor human rights records of companies.""

Russia's invasion has however seen many Germans reevaluate their attitudes towards defence and towards Russia -- including in the world of sport.

Dortmund's big local rivals Schalke, who currently play in the second division of German football, dropped a sponsorship deal with Russian state energy firm Gazprom after the start of the war in 2022.

In August 2021, six months before the invasion of Ukraine, the proportion who favored a good living standard had reached a historic high of 66 percent, against 32 percent who preferred great-power status (see figure 3).

These findings point to the emergence of what might be called a postimperial Navalny constituency in Russian society: a younger, more globalized, mainly urban segment of the population that was growing year on year and wanted Russia to be a postimperial, normal country. If these trends had continued for another generation, they would have posed a threat to the Putin regime.

Russian exceptionalism and the threat of the West are useful weapons in this domestic battle. Political scientist Kirill Rogov has pointed out that Putin's popularity has peaked roughly every seven years as a result of a military campaign: in 2000 after he launched the war in Chechnya, in 2008 with the war in Georgia, and in 2015 after the annexation of Crimea. In each case, his ratings declined after cresting a wave.

An even bigger foreign military adventure in 2022 enabled Putin to silence dissenting voices or force them into exile to rally the population around the flag and reconsolidate public support, which, the regime feared, was gradually dissipating. By making the war in Ukraine an existential issue for Russia and, by implication, his own regime, Putin was thereby also seeking to save himself.

Elite Compacts

If the need for regime survival is key to Putin's aggression in Ukraine, it casts Russia's relations with its other post-Soviet neighbors in a more instrumentalist light. Regime type and elites' Soviet backgrounds are fairly good predictors of whether Moscow still deems a country to be a reliable partner.

Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are one-party states. Many of their leaders are either former Soviet cadres or of an age that they were raised and educated in the Soviet Union. Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, and Tokayev are both graduates of elite Moscow universities.

Since the war in Ukraine, these leaders have adopted a two-prong survival strategy. They have reduced their security dependence on Russia and asked for and received international legitimation of their countries' sovereignty. At the same time, they have looked to forge elite-to-elite compacts with Moscow that provide guarantees of regime preservation. It is indicative that while Russia did not intervene in Central Asia in 2010 or 2022 when interethnic conflict was costing lives, it did intervene in Kazakhstan in January 2022 to support Tokayev's rule there.

Autocratic leaders seem to know where Russia's redlines are. Institutional collaboration with the EU or NATO -- as opposed to ad hoc partnerships on certain issues -- seems to be one limit not to be crossed. Another demand is that leaders demonstrate respect for the Russian language -- not so hard when they are all fluent Russian speakers. Thus, Aliyev makes the fact that there are more than 300 Russian-language schools in Azerbaijan a regular talking point with his Russian counterpart and told Putin in 2022 that the Russian language is ""a very important basis of our relations and future ties."" Tokayev made headlines in November 2023 by speaking Kazakh, not Russian, at a public meeting with Putin. A month earlier, however, an intergovernmental meeting in Kyrgyzstan inaugurated the International Organization for the Russian Language, which Tokayev had personally promoted.

These autocratic leaders share with the Putin regime a fear of a variation of the Arab Spring revolts that began in 2010 or a color revolution, a popular democratic uprising supported by Western pro-democracy nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Elites use the name ""Soros"" -- in reference to billionaire philanthropist George Soros -- as a shorthand for Western-inspired regime change or the instigation of disorder, even in democratic Georgia or countries where Soros's Open Society Foundations were long ago forced to shut down their activities, such as Uzbekistan.

Aliyev spelled this fear out at length in a February 2022 speech to a youth forum in Baku. He warned young people that they were the targets of ""globalists, or I provisionally call them 'Sorosians,' [with] a destructive mission -- to stir up the youth against their state."" Aliyev listed Western NGOs, among them Amnesty International and Freedom House, and media outlets, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, which, he said, had plotted to depose him. ""And in all of them Armenians play a leading role,"" he added. Aliyev went on to name ""Soros and the organizations he controls.""

In countering these threats, whether real or imagined, it is easy for these autocratic rulers to find common cause with Russia, which will never criticize the conduct of elections and -- as long as the regimes do not cross Moscow's redlines -- will not foment regime change.

Contrast this approach with Russia's relations with the leaders of Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine -- Nikol Pashinyan, Maia Sandu, and Volodymyr Zelensky -- who were all born in the 1970s, too late to be adults in the Soviet Union; received a different education; have a different outlook on the world; and have few or no connections in Russia. Having been democratically elected, these three base their legitimacy on a European-style people's mandate.

Both Pashinyan and Sandu are making bids to emancipate their countries from their dependence on Russia and are turning to the EU and the United States for support. Despite many similarities in terms of size, income level, and democratic standards, Moldova is in a more advantageous position than Armenia in this regard thanks to its geographic location adjacent to the EU. In response, Russia uses a range of instruments, from intervening in domestic politics to threatening to raise the price of its gas exports.

In trying to tilt both Armenia and Moldova back toward Russia and away from the West, the Russian government faces a dilemma, however. As public opinion in both countries is increasingly negative toward Russia, punitive measures, such as restricting trade or raising Armenia's gas price, risk further alienating the public and delivering a message of Russian power that may only play to the advantage of pro-Western politicians.

Georgia forms a strange hybrid case that belongs to neither of these two groups. The country is formally committed under its constitution to join the EU and NATO, and much of its professional elite is post-Soviet and Western educated. However, either from a fear of Russia or in collusion with it -- or, perhaps, both -- the governing Georgian Dream party has conspicuously failed to offer public support to Ukraine since 2022, and its political-business elite keeps many informal links with Russia. These maneuvers enabled the Georgian government to pull off the remarkable feat in 2023 of both moving closer to Russia and being granted candidate country status by the EU. In 2024, that balancing act was failing: by cracking down on dissent and pro-European protestors, the Georgian government seemed to prioritize the quiet approval of Russia over the objections of Western countries.

Multiple Neighborhoods

Geography is a crucial factor in the calculations of leaders who are recalibrating their relations with Russia. More than thirty years after the end of the Soviet Union, despite the continued assumptions of the Russian elite -- and, occasionally, some Western headline writers who should know better -- in labeling them ""Russia's backyard,"" all of these countries can be said to live in multiple neighborhoods. History has returned over the last three decades, so that neighboring powers, such as China, Turkey, Romania, and Poland, are now as influential as, or sometimes more influential than, Russia.

In Central Asia, China is the other main actor. The countries in the region can hedge by building relations with Beijing, but Russia's relationship with China is not necessarily adversarial. Experts on Central Asia caution against the notion that Beijing and Moscow are in conflict there. Alexander Gabuev and Temur Umarov have written that the two powers' economic interests in the region are complementary and that ""Moscow has come to view China's gradually growing security presence not as a competitive challenge but as an opportunity for burden sharing.""

In this context, the South Caucasus is once again what it has been for much of its history: a geopolitical crossroads where no one outside power has decisive influence. Throughout the region, Russia vies for influence with the EU, China, and Turkey. Moscow has acknowledged the emergence of Azerbaijan as the most powerful actor in the South Caucasus. Russia and Azerbaijan signed a partnership agreement in February 2022 shortly before the war in Ukraine began, but the accord is less significant to Baku than is Azerbaijan's strong alliance with Turkey, which was confirmed in a treaty signed in 2021.

Russia now bids to be a less formal third member in this strong Azerbaijan-Turkey axis. Moscow and Ankara have a centuries-old history of contestation in the region, but they also have shared interests. With the South Caucasian trio, Russia, Turkey, and Iran have invested in a new regional 3+3 format, through which all three can pursue an agenda to limit Western influence in the region. Political scientist SeÃ§kin KÃ¶stem has called their relationship ""managed regional rivalry.""

The EU is also a player in the neighborhood. In 2022-2023, Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia were given an EU membership perspective through candidate country status, something that would have been almost unthinkable before the war in Ukraine. There is even talk of Armenia being given such a perspective. In 2023, the EU deployed its first ever civilian monitoring mission to Armenia, a country that is a former Russian military ally.

The EU is challenging Russian energy monopolies, too. The war in Ukraine has seen the coming of age of the EU's Energy Community, an organization in force since 2006 in which Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine are members and Armenia is an observer. The community was founded with the explicit intention to gradually extend the body of EU law on energy, the environment, and climate to participating countries. In 2022, the EU had the instruments in place to help both Moldova and Ukraine begin fairly rapidly to shed their dependence on Russian gas. Armenia and Georgia are more vulnerable in this regard, with Armenia still depending on Russia for around 85 percent of its gas, which is shipped via Georgia.

Contestation over energy and transportation routes between the EU and Russia has intensified in the countries in the South Caucasus and Central Asia. Kazakhstan is vulnerable to Russia in that its main oil export route, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which exports 79 percent of the country's main asset -- crude oil -- runs through Russian territory, and Russia has demonstrated since 2022 that it is prepared to shut the pipeline down. Rerouting oil across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan is expensive and logistically challenging.

Azerbaijan and Georgia are better positioned and have used the post-2022 international environment to benefit economically from both Russia and Europe. In 2023, Azerbaijan struck a deal with the European Commission to double its gas exports to the EU by 2030 as Baku sought to wean itself off its dependence on Russian gas. It was a pledge that energy experts subsequently described as very difficult to meet but that earned Aliyev the compliment from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that Azerbaijan was a ""crucial partner.""

Simultaneously, Azerbaijan continued to work with Russia. In the winter of 2022-2023, Russian energy giant Gazprom sold gas to Azerbaijan to make up for shortfalls in Azerbaijani supply. In October 2023, Russian oil company Lukoil struck an agreement with Azerbaijan's state oil and gas company, SOCAR, under which Lukoil lent the Azerbaijani firm $1.5 billion and pledged to supply SOCAR's STAR oil refinery in Turkey with up to 200,000 barrels per day of Russian crude oil.

Russia badly needs new transportation and connectivity routes. With Western trade links cut off, routes south into the South Caucasus, east into Central Asia, and onward to the Middle East and the rest of Asia have become much more important. Ruslan Davydov, the head of the Russian Customs Service, said in October 2023, ""The main challenge for our customs service was to support the economy to withstand sanctions and facilitate a global pivot of our external trade from the west to the east and south.""

Meanwhile, the Georgian government has exploited this situation to renew flights to and increase trade with Russia -- to the frustration of Georgia's Western partners. And rail traffic through Azerbaijan has increased such that in March 2024, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that volumes through the Russia-Azerbaijan border crossing had increased fivefold. These examples are part of a wider picture in which Russia's southern and eastern post-Soviet neighbors are benefiting from doing business with both Russia and the West.

A Wartime Economy Brings Neighbors Closer

Conflict in Ukraine has reshaped the economic relationships between Russia and its neighbors to their advantage. While frontline states have reasons to be more fearful of Russia in 2024 than before, they are also benefiting economically from a situation in which they are exempt from Western sanctions and have therefore become key states for trade and reexport to Russia.

In this context, the EAEU has been given an unexpected new lease on life. Russia's geopolitical and business interests converged in the creation of an economic union in which the country was responsible for 87 percent of the organization's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 and which precluded the other member states -- Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan -- from signing free-trade agreements with other trading blocs, such as the EU. In return, the other states received low trade tariffs, free movement of labor, and other economic inducements, including a low gas price from Moscow.

Armenia was both a key battleground and an example to others in Russia's efforts to create a privileged economic space in the near abroad. In the 2000s, Russia had acquired almost all of Armenia's main economic resources. Despite this, in 2013, then Armenian president Serzh Sargsyan was on the verge of signing an Association Agreement with the EU that included a large trade component, a Deep and Comprehensive Free-Trade Area. This accord would inevitably have reduced Russia's grip on the Armenian economy. Then, two years of work with the EU were abruptly abandoned as Sargsyan announced that he would join Russia's EAEU instead. Sargsyan barely hid the fact that he did so under coercion from Moscow, saying that Armenia's core security interests were at stake.

A much bigger prize eluded Russia in 2013, however, in Ukraine. Then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych was also negotiating an EU Association Agreement. But unlike in Armenia, his decision to backtrack from the agreement triggered popular protests, which became known as the Euromaidan and eventually led to his downfall. At the time, Putin cited Ukraine's potential NATO membership as a reason for threatening the country and seizing Crimea. In fact, NATO membership for Ukraine was not an imminent prospect. The huge economic impact of the conflict that followed -- the billions of dollars of missed opportunities that Russian businesses suffered in Ukraine when the country failed to join the EAEU in 2013 -- is often overlooked.

Immediately after Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the EAEU looked unfit for purpose. In March, Russia unilaterally announced a ban on exports of grain and sugar to other EAEU member states -- a drastic measure that it later softened. Subsequently, the picture changed as Russia looked to neighboring countries to help it overcome its new isolation. The EAEU as well as the CIS were refashioned as more informal deal-making organizations. A May 2023 leaders' meeting in Moscow drew a strong turnout, being attended not only by the EAEU leaders but also by the president of Azerbaijan in person and the presidents of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan online.

The countries in the South Caucasus and Central Asia have all enjoyed an economic boom as a result of the war in Ukraine. Reexports of goods to Russia, including dual-use goods that could be adapted for military purposes, have burgeoned. For example, Kyrgyzstan has reported a massive increase in car imports from various countries since 2022, including a 5,500 percent increase in imports of German cars and vehicle parts -- presumably for reexport to Russia. The three countries in the South Caucasus have all registered similar dramatic rises in imports of European cars.

As a result, Armenia's GDP in 2024 is close to double what it was in 2021, having risen from $13.8 billion to $26.9 billion according to calculations by the International Monetary Fund. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan have all recorded healthy levels of economic growth. South Caucasian and Central Asian countries have also benefited economically from an influx of educated Russians, many of them relocating their businesses. Armenia and Kazakhstan were especially attractive destinations as migrants could maintain their bank cards and transactions with Russia under EAEU rules. In parallel, Central Asian migrant workers were needed more than ever in Russia to fill the jobs left by departing Russians and young men called up into the army.

These increased business links, many of which exploit loopholes or gaps in Western sanctions policies, have empowered middlemen, who are often ethnic nationals of South Caucasian or Central Asian countries and resident in Russia. One of them is former Georgian general prosecutor Otar Partskhaladze, who was sanctioned by the United States in September 2023 along with business associates who are close to both Russian elite circles and the Georgian Dream government. Another such middleman is Armenian-Russian tycoon Samvel Karapetyan, whose Tashir Group works closely with Gazprom and owns major energy assets in Armenia.

The group of elite Russian-Azerbaijanis who act as trusted intermediaries between Moscow and Baku is even more numerous. One prominent figure is God Nisanov, most famous for owning the Ukraine Hotel and the massive Food City produce markets. He is said to be friends with Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin and close to Aliyev and his family.

Western sanctions on Russian oil and gas have also been a boon for so-called petro-elites, who work between Russia, Central Asia, and Azerbaijan. Even before the war in Ukraine, Russia expert Morena Skalamera wrote that there was a shared interest among the Eurasian petro-economies in cooperating to perpetuate revenues for the elites and resist a shift away from fossil fuels: ""In Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, most natural resources and heavy industries remain controlled by an oligarchy of neftyaniki [oilmen] that still wields strong political influence and retains close business ties with Russian elites and insiders.""

For example, Uzbekistan is set to increase its imports of Russian gas, and cooperation with Russian energy companies has intensified. In Kazakhstan, Moscow's relations with the regime and family of former president Nursultan Nazarbayev were close until they fell out of favor in 2022. Under the Tokayev administration, Kazakh-Russian ""energy interdependence is growing,"" wrote political risk expert Kate Mallinson, while his government has struck several deals with Russia for uranium and coal.

Azerbaijan's petro-elite works more closely with Western companies but still keeps many connections with Russia. Senior Azerbaijani oil and gas managers who are Russian citizens include Gazprom's Famil Sadygov and Lukoil's Vagit Alekperov. According to a Wall Street Journal investigation, after Western companies withdrew from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil company Rosneft's oil trade was taken over by a group of Russian Azerbaijanis operating out of Dubai and Hong Kong. Given that petro-elites are close to or indistinguishable from political elites, it is likely that most or all of these business deals were negotiated at the highest level.

The increased economic cooperation between Russia and its neighbors is lucrative -- but also fragile and contingent on international political developments. New rounds of Western sanctions could threaten the livelihoods of Eurasian middlemen or shut down certain types of trade with Russia. A downturn in the Russian economy could very negatively affect migrant workers in Russia and Russian professional migrants in countries such as Armenia and Kazakhstan. In other words, a fresh crisis and a new round of bargaining between Moscow and its neighbors are possible at any moment.

Conclusion

Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made all of its other neighbors feel deeply insecure. The decision to attack a sovereign state, accompanied by a menacing neo-imperialist discourse from Russian officials and commentators, sent the other post-Soviet states the message that they also belonged to a sphere of Russian influence and had no right to determine their own futures.

The war has simultaneously made Russia more threatening, weaker, and more unpredictable. In 2022, Russia intervened militarily in Ukraine yet also declined to do so in two disputes in Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Pressed by a host of day-to-day preoccupations, the Putin regime no longer pretends to have an overarching regional security strategy. Instead, with multilateral organizations such as the UN and the OSCE also weaker, the trend is toward an ad hoc regionalization of security arrangements as other regional powers, such as China, Iran, and Turkey, assert their interests and may seek to cut deals with Russia over the heads of the countries concerned. It is more a gangland environment than a post-Russia order.

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine marked the end of three decades of softer Russian post-Soviet integration projects, which were encapsulated in the term ""near abroad."" One reason why Putin resorted to mass violence is because his integration projects to create a Russia-centered belt of states had not worked out as planned.

The invasion was not inevitable. Much of Russia's elite is afflicted by an imperial mindset, but the country's personalized autocracy is arguably more consequential. During Russia's first two post-Soviet decades, other more conciliatory options on how to engage with its neighborhood had been part of the mainstream political discourse. Putin's war was intended to legitimize his own autocratic rule by extinguishing alternative visions of a postimperial Russia, which would have promised more freedom not only for Russia's neighbors but also for Russian citizens.

In a highly uncertain environment and a potential security vacuum, the other post-Soviet states continue to do political and economic deals with Russia. Economic cooperation between the South Caucasus and Central Asian states, on the one hand, and Moscow, on the other, has increased in the past two years, as these countries provide alternative trade routes for Russia, which suffers from a Western economic blockade. Their economies have all grown since 2022.

To use the language of political science, regime type matters. The one-party autocratic governments in Central Asia and Azerbaijan have adapted best to the volatile post-2022 situation. A long Soviet legacy is no less palpable there than in Russia. The leaders of these countries have made their republics bastions of sovereignty and are generally averse to power sharing not only within their societies but also with their regional neighbors.

These leaders have reached out to Western governments and received new attention from them. That attention is warranted. Yet, most of these leaders are cut from the same Soviet cloth as the Russian elite, and their regimes bear a strong resemblance to Putin's. They have studied or worked in Russia and speak the same language as the Putin regime, both literally and figuratively. Their petro-elites continue to do oil and gas deals with Russian companies. While also reaching out to Western powers and China, these leaders let the Putin regime understand that they will not cross Russian redlines by embracing democracy or seeking EU or NATO membership. In this respect, the leaders are often out of step with their societies, where the mood of alienation from Russia is stronger.

With these one-party states, European actors should pursue policies that reinforce their sovereignty and enable them to decrease their dependence on Russia. But Europeans should be careful in the process not to strengthen undemocratic elites who still work closely with Moscow and are instrumentalizing Russia's war in Ukraine to their advantage.

Three other countries -- Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova -- have many differences but share the fact that they are democracies and more vulnerable to Russia. There, Western actors have more opportunities to provide direct security assistance, work with societies, and strengthen democratic institutions. But this is likely to be successful only if there is seen to be evidence of a serious long-term commitment. EU accession promises this, but the way ahead is not so clear to many citizens. These three countries also have divided societies, and it is important to engage with those constituencies that, for economic, cultural, or religious reasons, are still linked to Russia.

For the foreseeable future, Russia's neighbors can only expect the unexpected. This is especially true as all consequential decisions are being made by one man -- Putin -- and any checks and balances have been removed. If the Russian leader decides to take action in the near abroad, however unwise other state actors in Russia deem it to be, there is very little to stop him. Dealing with the threats and uncertainties that the new Russia presents requires from others both short-term agility and a long-term investment of resources.

After all, Russian energy exports to Europe have fallen precipitously since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with pipeline gas and oil flows to Europe declining by more than 80 percent and coal exports by nearly 100 percent. Although Russia has been able to redirect most of its oil and coal exports to other markets, it has been unable to do so with natural gas due to a lack of infrastructure linking its western production basins to consumers in Asia (Figure 1).[i]

PS-2, with its 50 billion cubic meters per year (bcm/y) design capacity, could offset nearly half of the decline in Russian pipeline gas export to the EU between 2021 and 2023. While the Kremlin has made no secret of its eagerness to expedite the project,[ii] its fate remains uncertain, largely because China has refrained from committing to it.

This commentary explores the future of PS-2 through an analysis of the broader China-Russia energy relationship and the Russian and Chinese positions on the project. It also examines implications of the pipeline's potential completion for global gas markets. The piece contends that despite Russia's intentions, PS-2 has made limited progress because China currently stands to benefit from keeping the project in a holding pattern. But if China can secure an attractive price for PS-2 gas, and if China's relations with the United States continue to deteriorate, Beijing could be motivated to reverse course. The completion of PS-2, if it happens, would likely therefore be on China's terms, and could reshape global gas markets in important ways.

The China-Russia Energy Relationship

The China-Russia energy trade relationship was sizeable before Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has grown even larger since. In 2021-23, Russian crude oil exports to China increased by one-third, while coal and LNG exports nearly doubled (Figure 2). In 2023, Russia was China's largest supplier of crude oil, second-largest supplier of coal, and third-largest supplier of LNG. Russia is also a growing exporter of pipeline gas to China. It increased deliveries through the Power of Siberia 1 (PS-1) pipeline from 10.4 bcm in 2021 to 22.7 bcm in 2023, accounting for 34 percent of China's pipeline gas imports.[iii] Russia expects PS-1 to reach its full 38 bcm/y capacity by 2025.[iv] Additionally, China and Russia signed an agreement in early February 2022 for another pipeline, the Far Eastern Route, to deliver 10 bcm/y by 2027.[v]

The Russian Perspective

Russia regards the loss of the European market as irreversible.[vi] While the Kremlin understands that expanded bilateral gas trade with China will never fully compensate for the loss of gas export revenues from Europe, [vii] and will naturally increase Russia's dependence on China,[viii] it continues to prioritize PS-2 for several reasons.

Geopolitics

When it comes to natural gas exports, geopolitics is the foremost consideration for Russia. Moscow regards gas as a potent tool in its dealings with counterparties across Eurasia. Until the 2010s, gas was widely used as ""geopolitical currency"" in the post-Soviet space: Russia offered gas at below-market rates in exchange for geopolitical alignment or control over critical energy infrastructure.[ix]

A similar calculation is likely at play with PS-2. By selling large volumes of cheap gas to China, Russia can potentially tie Beijing into a closer geopolitical alliance. Russia's bargaining power with China is much weaker than it was with its former satellite states in previous decades, however. Convincing China to commit to such a large project during the war would be a geopolitical coup for Moscow, demonstrating to the West and the Global South that it is able to deepen its energy relationship with China despite the war.

The Economy

PS-2 would most likely be less profitable than PS-1, due to its higher construction cost and the lower expected sales price of gas to China.[x] However, the pipeline is expected to generate a positive free cash flow of $2.5-$4.3 billion per year (compared with about $20 billion for PS-1).[xi] The project would also generate orders for Russia's steel producers and subcontractors and accelerate the economic development of eastern Russia,[xii] a top priority for Moscow.[xiii]

Russia is preparing for a long period of international isolation and transitioning to a wartime economy,[xiv] which supports large-scale, state-funded infrastructure projects. PS-2 could be one such flagship project, simultaneously marking Russia's decisive breakup with the West and its pivot to the East. Russia's indication in December 2023 that it was prepared to start building PS-2 without a supply contract underscores that the economic benefits associated with the project go far beyond the sale of gas molecules.[xv]

Gazprom's Viability

Gazprom, Russia's state-owned pipeline monopoly, has its own reasons for championing PS-2 that dovetail with those of the Kremlin. In 2023, Gazprom suffered a collapse in gas revenues, leading to a staggering $6.8 billion net loss -- the company's first annual loss since 1999.[xvi] On top of its recent financial woes, the company has no large-scale infrastructure projects planned aside from PS-2 and the stalled Baltic LNG terminal.[xvii] The PS-2 project therefore poses an existential challenge to Gazprom: completing it can reaffirm its role as Russia's natural gas champion; failing to do so could jeopardize the company's very existence, with its assets potentially being divided among various elite groups inside Russia.

Gazprom's main domestic rival, Rosneft, has been seeking to challenge Gazprom's monopoly over gas export in Russia. In 2014, Rosneft tried to connect to PS-1, but Gazprom was able to retain full control over the pipeline's capacity, despite Rosneft's political heft. In 2023, Rosneft's CEO repeated arguments from a decade before for allowing the company to use PS-2: the ability to monetize 8 bcm/y of associated gas in Eastern Siberia, the prospect of unlocking additional oil production in the region, and the possibility of reducing gas flaring and reinjection volumes.[xviii] Rosneft is still seeking to secure access, though it faces long odds. Nonetheless, the company is closely monitoring Gazprom for any mistakes that can sway Russian decision-makers to change course.

The Chinese Perspective

China has the luxury of time when it comes to PS-2 because it does not need the gas right away. Moreover, China is spoiled for choice in its supply options. As Beijing assesses whether and how PS-2 fits into its future import portfolio, its considerations almost certainly will include the following factors.

Projected Imports

One reason China is in no hurry to finalize an agreement for PS-2 is that the country is unlikely to need the gas before the mid-2030s. Projections of China's natural gas balance indicate that imports will reach around 250 bcm by 2030 (from less than 170 bcm in 2023),[xix] which largely (or entirely) can be met by already contracted supplies (Figure 3). Reference case projections also show, however, that there will most likely be room for PS-2 in China's import portfolio by 2040. In that year, China's gas imports could approach (or exceed) 300 bcm, with only 150 bcm covered by existing contracts.

Source: Authors' analysis based on CNPC ETRI 2060 World and China Energy Outlook (2022 Edition), Sinopec China Energy Outlook 2060 (2024 Edition), CNOOC Energy Outlook 2060 (2023), Shell LNG Outlook 2024, BP Energy Outlook 2023 (New Momentum scenario), EIA International Energy Outlook 2023, and S&P Global Commodity Insights (Liquefaction Projects and Contracts Data, March 8, 2024).[xx]

PS-2 faces competition nonetheless. China's LNG import capacity is set to increase from 144 to 250 bcm/y between 2022 and 2027.[xxi] This will allow China to absorb the 85 bcm/y of new LNG supply contracted in 2021-23 -- and to ink new agreements.[xxii] China could also increase pipeline imports from Central Asia via the stalled Line D project, which could deliver an additional 30 bcm/y from Turkmenistan if completed.

Price

If China moves forward with PS-2, it will look to secure a lower price for PS-2 gas than it secured for PS-1 gas, since it is in an even stronger negotiating position with Russia than it was in 2014 when the supply contract for PS-1 was signed. China customs data from December 2019 through December 2021 show that PS-1 gas was cheaper than China's other pipeline gas and LNG imports (Figure 4).[xxiii]

LNG prices will probably also factor into China's PS-2 calculus. Sinopec noted in its long-term energy outlook that a likely increase in future LNG prices may necessitate the development of new import pipelines.[xxiv]

Bargaining Power

Slow-walking PS-2 also gives China's importers leverage in contract negotiations with Russia and other suppliers; the discussions themselves put pressure on suppliers to sign contracts or risk losing a share of China's natural gas imports. Indeed, as those discussions have unfolded, Chinese companies have signed new LNG supply contracts, including three 27-year deals with Qatar.[xxv] Moreover, in May 2023, China's leader Xi Jinping told Central Asian leaders that construction of Line D should be expedited.[xxvi] These moves are reminders to Russia that China is pursuing other options to meet its import requirements.

Supply Security

The fate of PS-2 will partly depend on Beijing's assessment of the relative risks of greater dependence on Russian pipeline gas versus greater dependence on LNG imports. PS-2 would increase Russia's pipeline capacity to China to 98 bcm/y. If this capacity is built and fully utilized by 2030, China's net import dependence on Russian pipeline gas could reach 40 percent by 2030, on par with the EU's dependence before Russia invaded Ukraine (Figure 5).

On the other hand, China's reliance on LNG would almost certainly increase without PS-2. Chinese analysts have identified overreliance on US and Australian LNG as a vulnerability for China, which can be mitigated by growing gas imports from Russia.[xxvii] Indeed, as mentioned previously, it seems likely that a prolonged deterioration in the US-China relationship would prompt Beijing to look more favorably upon PS-2.[xxviii]

Implications for Global Gas Markets

PS-2 would have profound implications for global gas trade. The project would bring up to 50 bcm/y of stranded Russian gas to the global market by displacing LNG in China's import portfolio. For comparison, this volume is greater than Russia's total LNG exports (43 bcm) and slightly less than Africa's total LNG production (56 bcm) in 2023.[xxix]

Prolonging the Global LNG Glut

If PS-2 starts deliveries by 2030, as Gazprom's current plans suggest,[xxx] the extra gas from Russia would likely arrive in a market still coping with excess supply from the latest wave of LNG investment. Between 2024 and 2030, close to 300 bcm/y of new LNG export capacity could start operations.[xxxi] Most analysts maintain that this unprecedented supply wave will push the market into oversupply from 2025-26 until the late 2020s or early 2030s. China is expected to absorb much of the surplus.[xxxii] PS-2 could exacerbate this glut by weakening China's LNG appetite.

Weakening Russia's LNG Ambitions

There is a tension between PS-2 and Russia's plans to more than triple LNG exports by 2030 (to 100 million tons per annum or 136 bcm).[xxxiii] Facing Western sanctions and possibly EU LNG import bans, Russia is increasingly reliant on Chinese equipment, financing, shipbuilding, and LNG offtake. China would likely have to reduce its LNG imports to make room for PS-2 gas, removing an obvious destination for incremental Russian LNG supply. Without a concerted effort to create additional demand for Russian LNG in emerging economies (potentially by offering affordable LNG to the Global South at a modest profit in exchange for geopolitical influence),[xxxiv] PS-2 would call into question the viability of Russia's planned LNG projects.

Reinforcing China's Role in LNG Trading

PS-2 could also turbo-charge the emergence of Chinese LNG importers as global traders.[xxxv] Adding 50 bcm/y of pipeline gas to China's import portfolio would force Chinese companies to be even more agile in their optimization of import flows, especially contracted LNG. This could entail greater reloading capabilities within China, joint LNG optimization schemes with other importers, and reserving LNG regasification capacity in overseas terminals. A long position in LNG following the ramp-up of PS-2 and a more prominent role in global LNG trading could reinforce China's role as a global LNG market balancer in the 2030s, with far-reaching consequences for LNG trade flows, market liquidity, and energy geopolitics.

Conclusion

China has been content to keep PS-2 on the drawing board for now, affording it time to assess its post-2030 import needs, including the balance between pipeline and LNG imports. But certain geopolitical considerations for both China and Russia could propel the project toward completion, even if China has no immediate need for additional pipeline gas. Russia's push for the project has been driven by noncommercial factors all along. For China, the price of gas and overreliance on a single supplier have been the primary concerns until now, but worsening relations with the US could lend additional support for PS-2. If and when the project is built, it likely will be on China's terms -- and it may well reshape the global gas market.

After the death of Alexei Navalny in late February, The New York Times ran an article quoting from William F. Browder, ""an American-born British financier who has campaigned against human-rights abuses in Russia,"" who said that ""Aleksei Navalny is a globally recognized and beloved individual who was snuffed out by a killer. This is a classic good-versus-evil story. These types of symbols and stories have a resonance that goes so far beyond the petty squabbles of the world we live in.""

Browder cited as precedent for Navalny's death the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky, Browder's ""lawyer and auditor who died in a Moscow jail cell under suspicious circumstances.""

After Magnitsky died, Browder had campaigned for countries' to pass laws that would blacklist Russia for human-rights violations. The European Union was the ""most reluctant,"" according to Browder, though ""adopted the legislation after Mr. Navalny suffered near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent in 2020.""

According to Browder, Navalny is a Russian equivalent of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

His death would ""make it politically untenable for American lawmakers to be viewed as accommodating Mr. Putin, making it harder for at least some Republicans in Congress to hold up additional military aid to Ukraine,"" which Browder long championed.

For years now, Browder has been presented in The New York Times and other mainstream U.S. media outlets as a great human rights crusader determined to stand up against evil.

The grandson of Earl Browder, the former chairman of the Communist Party USA, he has been a key driver behind U.S. policies towards Russia in the new Cold War as a media gadfly sought out for his alleged expertise on Russia, and lobbyist for hard-line anti-Putin policies.

Browder has contributed to the political campaigns of Russia hawks like Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) through Ziff Brothers, a firm associated with Hermitage Capital, a multi-million dollar hedge-fund that Browder operated in Russia during the 1990s and early 2000s before he fell afoul of the Putin government.

Is Browder Credible?

In 2013, Browder was found guilty in a Russian court of failing to pay 552 million rubles in taxes ($16 million) and illegally buying up shares of Gazprom for which he was sentenced in absentia to nine years in prison.

Browder accused the Russian government of perpetrating a $230 million scam in 2009 to takeover his company, Hermitage Capital, though a film that has been blacklisted in the U.S. by Andrei Nekrasov and written by Torstein Grude, The Magnitsky Act: Behind the Scenes (2016), and a book by Alex Krainer, Grand Deception: The Browder Hoax (2017), revealed serious inconsistencies in Browder's story.

Notable among these inconsistencies is the fact that Magnitsky was not actually a lawyer but a tax accountant, as Browder admitted under oath, and that he was not hired by Browder after his company was scammed as Browder has claimed.

Magnitsky was rather hired to set up an offshore structure that Russian investigators would later say was used for tax evasion and illegal share purchases by Hermitage.

According to Nekrasov's investigation, Magnitsky was an expert in ""circumventing the laws and regulations"" which required foreigners like Browder to pay more for business and stock shares.

Russian-language transcripts of Magnitsky's interviews with police show that Magnitsky never actually accused anyone of malfeasance and was not a whistle-blower but was questioned by police about tax evasion practices Browder's firm had been accused of beginning in 2004.

At the time of Magnitsky's arrest, Browder never discussed his case or assisted in his defense, and Hermitage never had any mention of it on its website, turning Magnitsky into a martyr only after he died.

The U.S. embassy also did not raise any public concerns or outcry in the crucial period that Magnitsky was in prison, raising questions as to why they only spotlighted the case after his death. When I tried to pose this question to Ambassador John Beyrle, he refused to answer, as did later ambassador Michael McFaul, another key Russia hawk and driver of U.S. Cold War policies.

Mr. Nekrasov told me in an interview that he spoke off-the-record with a Doctor Kratov from the Butyrka prison, who was indicted and put on trial in Russia for negligence in his treatment of Magnitsky, though acquitted.

According to Nekrasov, ""Kratov said that in his personal opinion there was a chance that Magnitsky had indeed been killed (he died of a heart attack officially) but that in that case only Browder and Co. could have been behind it. Theoretically it is possible to organize such a killing from outside a jail in Moscow, even if there is no evidence of it in our case in my view. What is clear however, is that only Browder stood to benefit from Magnitsky's death, while the authorities needed Magnitsky alive, as a witness against Browder.""

Browder was charged by Russian authorities with murder in the death of Magnitsky. The evidence against him was an intercepted communication from Western intelligence agencies which allegedly exposed an Operation called Quake designed to ""start a scandal or significant news trigger to discredit the Russian Federation in the eyes of the international community.""

Operating under the code name ""Agent Solomon,"" Mr. Browder, with Britain's MI-6 and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny (AKA ""Agent Freedom"") is said to have arranged for ""proxies in the Russian federal penitentiary service to arrange the termination of any medical services for Magnitsky."" Similar accusations were previously aired on Russian state television but dismissed by independent analysts because the communication was found to have had spelling errors that derived from flawed Russian translation.

A Capitalist Rebel

Browder's book Red Notice provides fascinating autobiographical detail about how Browder rebelled against his left-wing family by ""putting on a suit and tie and becoming a capitalist.""

After receiving his M.B.A. at Stanford University, Browder worked for the investment banking firm Salmon Brothers, where he turned a $25 million investment in privatization vouchers in Russia distributed after the fall of the Soviet Union into a $125 million stock portfolio.

Browder then started up his own investment firm, Hermitage Capital, with help from Syrian-Israeli banker Edmond Safra, an owner of the Republican National Bank of New York which had sold tens of billions of dollars in U.S. dollar notes to corrupt Russian banks, who also profited from the privatization voucher scheme.

Helping to launder funds from the illicit sale of arms and drugs by CIA operatives in the 1980s Iran-Contra affair, Mr. Safra died under suspicious circumstances after selling shares of Hermitage to HSBC in 1999. According to a New York Times profile, Safra taught Browder ""not to shy away from kicking up a scandal to protect his interests.""

By 1997, Hermitage came to manage over $1 billion in assets and was able to withstand a $900 million loss following the Asian financial crisis, in part by adopting a strategy of picking up shares from corrupt firms and attacking corruption in them and helping to reinvigorate them.

According to Times reporter Clifford J. Levy, Browder functioned as ""a foreign version of the Russian oligarchs who earned their fortunes in the mass privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union. He courted publicity.""

Self-Serving Criticism of Putin

Browder's emergence as a leading critic of Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin appears to be entirely self-serving.

Nekrasov's film and Krainer's book suggest that Browder and not the Russian government were behind the $230 million tax scam involving his company, Hermitage, which his lawyer all but admitted to in a book launch gala in London.

In a campaign supported by U.S. and British intelligence, Browder began spreading rumors about Putin in an attempt to delegitimize his criminal prosecution, and because Browder wanted to resume Hermitage's operations' under a new Russian leader that, unlike Putin, kow-towed to foreign business interests.

In Red Notice, Browder claimed that after Mikhail Khodorkovsky's arrest in October, 2003, before he was allegedly about to sell shares of Yukos Oil to Exxon Mobil,, Putin struck a deal with Russia's oligarchs granting them prosecutorial immunity.

In exchange, they allegedly promised to give Putin somewhere between thirty and seventy percent of their wealth. Browder qualifies his assertion by noting that ""he wasn't there"" when Putin brokered this deal so ""he was only speculating.""

In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2016, Browder claimed Putin- -- whom he referred to as a ""criminal dictator not too different from Hitler, Mussolini or Gadhafi"" -- demanded fifty percent and from that point on became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the ""richest man"" in the world.

However, there is no hard evidence to corroborate these allegations and Browder's changing the numbers implies a lack of precision.

Andrei Nekrasov told me that ""there is no evidence of Putin's excessive riches. There is not a single evidence of some bank accounts, or bribe he, or his wife for example, got from an industry, or any such thing. While there is such evidence in the case of quite a few other heads of state [including] evidence in [Boris] Yeltsin's case, quite specific and direct.""

Fake Scholarship

According to Moscow correspondent John Helmer, Browder was the key source for a much touted scholarly book by Karen Dawisha entitled Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? published in 2014 by Simon & Schuster.

Dawisha was then the Walter E. Havighurst Professor of Political Science in the Department of Political Science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and director of the University's Havighurst Center for Russian and Post-Soviet Studies.

Dawisha's editor at Simon & Schuster, Alice Mayhew, had been taking editorial advice from the CIA since James Angleton ran the CIA's counter-intelligence operations against suspected Russian moles, according to John Helmer an Australian Moscow correspondent.

Putin's Kleptocracy argued that corruption and authoritarianism in Russia in recent decades were not byproducts of the country's emergence from communism, but rather building blocks of a plan devised in the early 1990s by Putin and a circle of trusted associates from St. Petersburg, where Putin had served as deputy mayor.

Dawisha wrote that ""the group now in power started out with Putin from the beginning. They are committed to a life of looting without parallel. This kleptocracy is abhorrent not just because of the gap between rich and poor that it has created, but because in order to achieve success this cabal has had to destroy any possibility of freedom.""

Dawisha claimed further that this St. Petersburg cabal, which Putin headed, ""displayed a pattern of uncontrollable greed, of wanting what rightfully belongs to others, which...has resulted in [Putin amassing] over twenty official residences, fifty eight planes and four yachts.""

John Helmer exposes Dawisha as an academic charlatan and fraud in his book, Sovcomplot: How Pirates Tried to Capture the Treasure of the Russian Seas, and Were Caught Out (2023).

Helmer writes that ""Dawisha attempted no analysis of a Russian commercial business or state enterprise except for Gazprom, the state gas producer. Her account of that is entirely based on allegations by William Browder; Dawisha reported none of the Russian or American investigations of Browder's fabrications.""

Dawisha had tried in her book to make Gennady Timchenko, an executive with the Russian shipping company Sovcomplot, one of the linchpins of her case that Putin enriched his friends and cronies from St. Petersburg who in turn enriched Putin.

As an executive with Sovcomplot, Timchenko was accused of involvement in a privatization scheme resulting in the embezzlement of millions of dollars. Dawisha claimed that Timchenko and Putin's ties went back to the St. Petersburg in the early 1990s and that Timchenko secretly gave Putin a 75% stake in a lucrative oil trading firm, allowing him to amass a fortune of $40 billion.

However, Dawisha provides no proof of the allegation, which if true, Helmer said, would have been disclosed in court testimony during a British court case involving Sovcomplot. This case largely exonerated Timchenko and made no mention of Putin, which it would have if Putin was as corrupt as Dawisha and Browder claimed.

Helmer's careful investigation revealed that Putin had no personal involvement in any embezzlement schemes by Sovcomplot executives or their coverup. Putin took a hands-off approach to the company's operations apart from wanting to ensure that the company continued to expand and that it was not completely privatized. Russian authorities also prosecuted corrupt officials when they tried to embezzle money.

According to Helmer, Dawisha and Browder's collaboration in spreading disinformation was undertaken with the purpose of ""justifying, encouraging and expanding the U.S. war for regime change in the Kremlin."" Dawisha's book ""is a case for all the U.S. government policies currently underway"" including the use of force and violence to oust Putin because, as Dawisha put it, ""Putin will not go gentle into the night.""

In the Robber Baron Tradition

John Hobson famously emphasized in his 1902 classic Imperialism how the British empire was driven by financial elites seeking outlets for new investments and who unduly influenced government policy. With regards to the United States, Hobson wrote that ""it is Messrs. Rockefeller, Pierpont Morgan, Hannah, Schwab, and their associates who need imperialism....because they desire to use the public resources of their country to find profitable employment for the capital which otherwise would be superfluous.""

William F. Browder follows in the same tradition in this neoliberal era.

He and his collaborators have been extremely successful in using their wealth and political connections to sway public opinion against Putin by financing anti-Russian politicians and gaining voice in the media, and have in turn helped legitimize the expansion of NATO, the deadly U.S. proxy war in Ukraine, and a new arms race that benefits the military-industrial-petroleum complex.

At one point, Browder called Secretary of State John Kerry -- a lukewarm supporter of the Magnitsky Act -- ""Putin's lapdog"" and purveyor of an ""appeasement policy.""

This kind of poisonous language suggests that Browder is part of a planned political campaign, driven by powerful financial and ""deep state"" interests who profited from the plunder of Russia in the 1990s that Putin put a stop to.

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.

On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.

""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]

The UK Ministry of Defence reported that Gazprom, one of Russia's state-owned energy companies, has reported its biggest annual loss for 25 years. Gazprom's revenues fell by around 30 per cent in 2023, leading to an annual net loss of approximately 629 billion roubles (USD $6.9 billion).

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and subsequent degradation of Russia's relationships with the West, has severely constrained Gazprom's operations. Gazprom's failure to fully re-orientate its exports away from its dependence on European markets will likely continue to restrict its profits until at least 2030. Whilst Gazprom has been able to divert some of its trade to alternative markets, due to infrastructural limitations, these likely only accounted for 5 to 10 per cent of the lost European sales in 2023. It is highly likely that an increase in future sales is reliant on construction of new export infrastructure, such as the 'Power of Siberia 2' gas pipeline.

High taxation on Gazprom's revenues in 2022 and 2023 has almost certainly reduced the ability and incentives for Gazprom to invest in its expansion to alternative markets. In 2023, Gazprom paid an estimated 2.5 trillion roubles (USD $28 billion) to the Russian budget, approximately 9 per cent of total government revenues. The Russian government plans to further increase the tax burden on Gazprom in 2024, which likely contributed to Gazprom's decision to cut its investment for 2024 by around 15 per cent.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that during the day of May 12, there were 146x tactical engagements.

At present, Russia has tactical success.

Measures are planned to destroy an enemy who has wiped into Ukrainain defense.

Ukrainain defenders conduct defensive actions, inflict fire on Russian forces, extensively deploy unmanned systems for reconnaissance and mission point strikes to target maximum losses. The deployment of reserves to stabilize the situation is ongoing. In the process of determining tasks to troops, one of the main priorities is to save the lives of Ukrainain soldiers.

Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know.

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

Glory to Ukraine!

Two Ukrainian hydroelectric power plants will not be functioning due to damage caused by the Russian missile attack on May 8th - Ukrhydroenergo.

""To date, all hydro generation has suffered devastating damage. Destroyed equipment requires considerable efforts for repair and restoration, as well as significant financial resources,"" Ukrhydroenergo added.

Never? Again.

â¡ï¸Germany to buy 3 HIMARS for Ukraine.

Germany will buy three HIMARS multiple rocket launchers for Ukraine, the country's defense minister announced on May 9. Speaking during a trip to Washington, Boris Pistorius said they would be purchased from the U.S. and handed over to Kyiv.

â¡ï¸Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin is strangling Ukraine's economy by knocking out much of its electricity generation and wearing down the civilian population by bombing cities. Kharkiv, which is already rationing electricity, is being hit by glide bombs almost daily. Yet the city of more than 1m people is keeping calm and carrying on. On a sunny afternoon last week, residents strolled through a park and attendants went on emptying rubbish bins, even as two glide bombs landed with huge explosions less than a kilometre away. Keeping the city functioning and clean is a way to stand up to destruction and chaos.

With around 50,000 fresh Russian troops gathering across the border some 40km away, Kharkiv's commanders know they may be a target in Russia's next push. One scenario would be to isolate the city by cutting the main road to Kyiv. Another would be to move some 10km closer, putting the city's eastern outskirts within artillery range and creating a buffer zone to protect Belgorod, a Russian city that is being hit by Ukrainian drones.

Konstantin Nemichev is the commander of the famous Kraken regiment, a special-forces outfit formed in the early days of the invasion in 2022 that defended Kharkiv. He expects the enemy to attack the province again in mid-May, but reckons they will fail to get near the city. Interviewed outside a ruined school building in the east of town, the site of an intense firefight in 2022 in which invading soldiers were wiped out, the commander says the defence is much stronger now. It has three lines of fortifications and a full brigade to stop the Russians. ""They can move a few kilometres into the province,"" he says, ""but I don't think they can get as far as 10km.""

The Ukrainian armed forces know they have no choice but to fight on. ""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region. But this sense of urgency and existential threat, he says, needs to penetrate into the whole of Ukrainian society. ""People need to know the truth,"" he says. And Ukraine needs unity as it enters a new stage of conflict.

I want to reemphasize LTC Tkach's assessment:

""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region.

Those, as well as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and Ukrainians existence as Ukrainians, are the stakes!

Professor Snyder has posted a new explainer of Russian propaganda. From the Thread Reader App:

President Zelenskyy continues to shake up his senior national security team. From The Kyiv Independent:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's State Security Administration (UDO), Serhii Rud, according to a presidential decree published on May 9.

The UDO's main tasks include ensuring the security of the President of Ukraine and high-ranking officials of the state, as well as the protection of administrative buildings and objects of state authorities of Ukraine.

Rud's dismissal comes shortly after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have uncovered a network of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who were plotting to assassinate President Zelensky and other high-ranking officials in Ukraine. Two colonels of the UDO accused of leaking classified information to Russia were reportedly detained.

The FSB network aimed to find perpetrators among the military close to Zelensky's security, ""who could take the head of state hostage and then kill him.""

Just a few weeks before, SBU officials and Polish law enforcement worked to detain a Polish citizen who allegedly offered to Russia to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In late November, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

The Ukrainian president issued several presidential decrees this week mandating changes in senior leadership across Ukraine's government and military.

Dmytro Hereha was reappointed as the commander of Ukraine's Support Forces, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was formally dismissed from military service. Zaluzhnyi will now serve as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.K.

Russian sources are claiming the Mariupol strike was ATACMS:

A video of the drone attacking the plant in Russian Salavat, Bashkiria, appeared on Russian Telegram channels.

The person who is filming says the drone is very large.

It looks like the drone flew about 1,500 km before it reached its target and hit the oiloil catalytic cracking unit.

Gazprom neftekhim Salavat is one of the largest oil refining and petrochemical production complexes in Russia. It specializes in the production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other types of petroleum products.

/6. According to Russian media Baza:

""the drone hit the catalytic cracking unit at about one o'clock in the afternoon, local time. Afterwards, employees of the enterprise heard a bang and saw smoke in the area of the Southern entrance. The fire was small, so workers were not evacuated; the plant is operating normally.

According to the head of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Radiy Khabirov, emergency services and heads of law enforcement agencies are now working on the spot. Preliminary, no one was hurt.""

He's also the author of ""Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.""

Remember the 2023-24 soccer season, when Bayer Leverkusen went undefeated in the Bundesliga, Manchester City won their fourth Premier League trophy in a row, Harry Kane scored approximately 300 goals and still didn't win a trophy and Borussia Dortmund made the Champions League final despite finishing fifth in their domestic league?

Me neither. Memorial Day is over, and that means the time has arrived for a summer of international soccer. For the U.S. men's national team, in particular, it means it's time for their last few truly competitive matches before they co-host the 2026 World Cup. Yes, they'll still have the Nations League, but they've already won it multiple times and the pressure in those matches can't equate to what they'd normally face in World Cup qualifying, or what they will face in June when the Copa America starts.

So, ahead of a summer that will also include the Olympics, we're taking stock of the depth of the American soccer program as a whole. We're going to sketch out the 15-deep depth charts for the eight major position groups: goalkeeper, right-back, left-back, center-back, defensive midfield, center midfield, winger and center forward.

The purpose of the exercise isn't necessarily to identify who exactly is the 14th-best American left-back, but to see what the USMNT's positions of strength and weakness are.

The USMNT's latest roster -- the last before the Copa America squad is announced -- is the guideline for the top players of each position. Beyond that, the methodology is a combination of past call-ups, comments from USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter and current form to sketch out the rest of each position group. As such, consider the top of each group to be a much more confident projection, while at some positions there might be very little to separate, say, the ninth player and the 25th player.

OK, we've got a list of 120 Americans to get through, so let's sort the top 15 players in every position on the USMNT depth chart.

This used to be a position of strength for the USMNT, and now it's probably the weakest spot in the entire player pool. But I'm not sure that's as bad as it seems.

Obviously, a team at the USMNT's level -- somewhere in the 15th-30th best-in-the-world range -- specifically benefits from having a great goalkeeper. These teams are not going to dominate their way to trophies. If one of these sides is to make a deep run in a major tournament -- like Morocco at the previous World Cup -- they are going to need to win a couple matches in which the opposition creates the majority of the chances. In those matches, you need your 'keeper to come up big.

In the past, the USMNT had multiple 'keepers who could come up big. Kasey Keller and Brad Friedel, both very good in Europe, were on the roster at the 2002 World Cup. In 2006, Keller, Tim Howard and Marcus Hahnemann were there -- all playing over in Europe. In 2010, it was Howard, Hahnemann and Aston Villa's Brad Guzan. And in 2014, Howard and Guzan were there again.

Now, the starter, Turner, hasn't played a Premier League match since January, while the backup, Ethan Horvath, had to go to the Championship midseason in order to find game time. Perhaps more worrying is that they were both quite poor when they played this season.

Horvath, per the site FBref, allowed 4.1 goals more than expected in his half-season with Cardiff, while Turner conceded 5.9 more than expected across his starts for Nottingham Forest. Orange are goals, purple are shots and the larger the circle, the greater the post-shot expected-goal value of the attempt:

Of course, the downside of having multiple great goalkeepers is that one of them will never play. Two great midfielders can both get on the field, two great center forwards can sub in and out with each other. And so if you had to pick one area on the field to not have any real depth, goalkeeper would be the choice. Plus, Turner was totally fine at the World Cup despite not playing a single league match for Arsenal during the 2022-23 season.

This position doesn't feel as strong as it did a couple seasons ago when Turner was breaking statistical models for goalkeeper performance in MLS, but I'm not sure it's because he's gotten worse. Rather, the past two seasons have provided more information about what his actual level is: probably somewhere between elite MLS 'keeper and starter in a ""Big Five"" top European league.

1. SergiÃ±o Dest, FC Barcelona

2. Joe Scally, Borussia Monchengladbach

3. Bryan Reynolds, KVC Westerlo

4. Shaq Moore, Nashville FC

5. DeAndre Yedlin, FC Cincinnati

6. Nathan Harriel, Philadelphia Union

7. Reggie Cannon, Queens Park Rangers

8. Marlon Fossey, Standard Liege

9. Brooks Lennon, Atlanta United

10. Nick Lima, New England Revolution

11. Kyle Duncan, New York Red Bulls

12. Henry Wingo, Ferencvaros

13. Dylan Nealis, New York Red Bulls

14. Keegan Rosenberry, Colorado Rapids

15. Justin Che, ADO Den Haag

I'm sure some people who saw Moore struggle in limited minutes in Qatar were filled with dread when they saw his name on the USMNT's latest roster, the one from which Berhalter is presumably using to select his Copa America squad. But Moore seems to be a ""break-in-case-of-emergency"" option.

Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tim Weah are all capable of playing that position, and it seems like Reynolds might've earned the spot had there not been an Olympics this summer as well. An uninjured Yedlin might've gotten the nod over Moore, too. But the pattern with these position rankings is similar to the pattern at almost every other position: a couple starters for top-50 teams in the world, then a bunch of guys either playing in MLS or somewhere like Belgium or the Netherlands.

Dest will miss the Copa America after tearing his ACL, but such is the state of the player pool that Berhalter will likely plug in Scally, a 21-year-old who's been starting in the Bundesliga for three seasons now. Such is the state of the player pool, too, that there is a significant drop off in quality between Dest and Scally.

Dest is one of the team's ball-progression engines whenever he plays: driving the ball upfield with his feet or combining with the same-side midfielder and right winger. Dest's tight-space skill and creativity are unmatched in the player pool. Scally, meanwhile, is more of that modern full-back hybrid, somewhere between a center-back and full-back, rather than a pedal-to-the-medal attacker like Dest typically is.

How will that manifest itself this summer? The U.S. might be a little more solid defensively, but they also might struggle at times to work the ball into the attacking third.

1. Chris Richards, Crystal Palace

2. Tim Ream, Fulham

3. Miles Robinson, FC Cincinnati

4. Cameron Carter-Vickers, Celtic

5. Mark McKenzie, Genk

6. Walker Zimmerman, Nashville FC

7. Auston Trusty, Sheffield United

8. Maximilian Dietz, Greuther Furth

9. Jackson Ragen, Seattle Sounders

10. James Sands, NYCFC

11. Aaron Long, Los Angeles FC

12. John Brooks, Hoffenheim

13. Jonathan Tomkinson, Bradford City

14. Justen Glad, Real Salt Lake

15. Sean Nealis, New York Red Bulls

It's funny how quickly things can change. Richards didn't make the World Cup roster, and now he's the team's first-choice center-back.

His development this past season shows, well, how development tends to work. It's actually quite rare for a player to get touted as a top prospect and then just immediately play a ton of minutes from his teens through his 30s. This is what makes Pulisic and McKennie special -- both currently and in the history of the USMNT.

Instead, most players break out, stagnate or regress slightly and then establish themselves as trusted starters. Richards was a top prospect at Bayern Munich. He had two successful loan spells at Hoffenheim, and he even started a match for Bayern in the 2020-21 season at age 20. Given his early success at a position where players peak much later, it wasn't impossible to envision a world where he integrated into the Bayern first team eventually.

Instead, he transferred to Crystal Palace, missed a chunk of the 2022-23 season through injury and missed out on Qatar in the process. Did he ruin his career by moving to England? Not quite.

This season, Richards frequently played as midfielder under Roy Hodgson at Palace before getting pushed into the backline once Oliver Glasner took over and the club immediately went on its late-season tear. At 24, Richards now looks like a viable starter for a mid-tier team in the most competitive soccer league on the planet.

The question for this summer, then, is who starts next to Richards? Given the lineup in the Nations League final, it's likely Ream, but the 36-year-old has started just one game for Fulham since February. There is some depth behind Ream, though.

Robinson was a key starter for the USMNT in World Cup qualifying and he might be playing in Europe already had he not torn his Achilles. McKenzie starts for a Europa League team. Carter-Vickers does the same for Celtic, a Champions League team.

1. Antonee Robinson, Fulham

2. Kristoffer Lund, Palermo

3. John Tolkin, New York Red Bulls

4. Caleb Wiley, Atlanta United

5. George Bello, LASK

6. DeJuan Jones, New England Revolution

7. Jonathan Gomez, Real Sociedad

8. Marco Farfan, FC Dallas

9. Sam Vines, Colorado Rapids

10. Ryan Hollingshead, LAFC

11. Lynden Gooch, Stoke City

12. Andrew Brody, Real Salt Lake

13. Daniel Lovitz, Nashville FC

14. Kevin O'Toole, NYCFC

15. Andrew Gutman, Chicago Fire

While he's not the best outfield player for the USMNT, Robinson might be the hardest to replace.

Counting stats don't paint the whole picture of defensive impact, but there's at least some signal when you're at the top of the leaderboard. The USMNT's starting left-back led the Premier League in interceptions this past season and ranked seventh in tackles:

Much like he is with the U.S., he was also a vital outlet for Fulham in leading the team in progressive passes received. Robinson is just a really good player -- and as of now, he's the only left-footed American full-back you can confidently say that about.

Lund is still unproven with the USMNT and in a major European league. He hasn't necessarily been lighting up Serie B or anything like that. After him, in the pool, there are a handful of youngsters -- one of whom seems likely to pop, whether it's Tolkin or Wiley, who have played a ton of minutes at a young age in MLS, or Bello, who starts for one of the best teams in Austria, or Gomez, who has plenty of youth national team experience and played nearly 3,000 minutes on loan in Spain's second division this season.

There's a lot of projection there still, and then not much else beyond them.

1. Tyler Adams, Bournemouth

2. Johnny Cardoso, Real Betis

3. Lennard Maloney, Heidenheim

4. Aidan Morris, Columbus Crew

5. Tanner Tessmann, Venezia

6. Kellyn Acosta, Chicago Fire

7. Joshua Atencio, Seattle Sounders

8. Cole Bassett, Colorado Rapids

9. Jackson Yueill, San Jose Earthquakes

10. Keaton Parks, NYCFC

11. Frankie Amaya, New York Red Bulls

12. Obed Vargas, Seattle Sounders

13. Daniel Edelman, New York Red Bulls

14. Dante Polvara, Aberdeen

15. Wil Trapp, Minnesota United

Everything I just said about Robinson used to be true about Adams.

It seemed, in part, like much of the USMNT's success at the 2022 World Cup came down to the team lucking into the healthiest season of Adams' professional career. No one else on the team had his defensive range, and then he also combined it with solid ball-progressing passing. Adams allowed Berhalter to play two more freelancing midfielders ahead of him in Musah and McKennie and two very aggressive full-backs in Dest and Robinson outside of him.

Without Adams, it seemed like it might all fall apart. And then -- the USMNT annihilated Mexico and Canada at the Nations League last summer without Adams. And Cardoso became a full-time starter for the seventh-place team in LaLiga this season.

While a healthy Adams raises the team's ceiling, it's a massive boon for the team to not be so reliant on a player who is always injured. They were fine with Musah playing as the deepest midfielder a year ago, and Cardoso came in for Adams at halftime of the Nations League final against Mexico a few months ago.

Beyond them, Maloney starts in the Bundesliga, but offers very little on the ball. Both Morris and Tessmann seem likely to develop into consistent USMNT call-ups soon, and then there are a ton of young central midfielders, who could be classified in either midfield category, getting consistent playing time in MLS.

1. Weston McKennie, Juventus

2. Giovanni Reyna, Borussia Dortmund

3. Yunus Musah, AC Milan

4. Malik Tillman, Bayern Munich

5. Luca de la Torre, Celta Vigo

6. Timmy Tillman, LAFC

7. Jack McGlynn, Philadelphia Union

8. Paxten Aaronson, Eintracht Frankfurt

9. Cristian Roldan, Seattle Sounders

10. Gianluca Busio, Venezia

11. Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake

12. Benjamin Cremaschi, Inter Miami

13. Rokas Pukstas, Hajduk Split

14. Julian Green, Greuter Furth

15. Djordje Mihailovic, Colorado Rapids

Just read the names of those first four clubs back to yourself. Things are very good in the advanced midfield role. McKennie is one of the most important players on Juventus. Reyna was great in the Nations League despite barely playing at all at the club level this season. Musah had a decent first season for the second-best team in Italy. And Tillman put up ridiculous numbers while on loan at PSV Eindhoven this past season.

Three of those guys are 21, and McKennie is 25. After that group, there's a good deal of potential, too.

De la Torre started 22 games in LaLiga this season. The elder Tillman, Timmy, got one of the final roster spots at the Copa America. McGlynn has been getting significant minutes in MLS since he was 17. Aaronson found some playing time in the Netherlands after a second half of season loan from Frankfurt. At 21, Busio is on his third season of starter minutes in Italy, and his performance has improved in each one. Luna is one of the more promising creative prospects to come out of MLS in a while. Cremaschi, 19, already earned a senior-team call-up and Pukstas started 28 games and scored eight goals for the third-best team in Croatia.

The scoring and creating winger is probably still the most important position in the current iteration of the professional game. Thankfully, the USMNT's best player plays there, and he's coming off the best season of his professional career.

In his first season in Serie A, Pulisic set career highs in minutes (2,602), goals (12) and assists (8). His underlying numbers weren't quite as hot -- 8.0 xG and 4.8 expected assists -- but the most important thing for him this season was reestablishing himself as a legit starter on a Champions league team.

After Pulisic, though, it's not great! Unlike the full-back positions, wingers tend to be more interchangeable on the left and right side, but there's still a concerning lack of quality depth.

Weah spent most of the season at Juventus as a backup wingback. Although he started him at center forward in the Nations League final, Berhalter said he views Wright as more of a winger. And I think that's probably because he's worried about the wing depth beyond Pulisic and maybe he's also considering dropping Weah back into a full-back role. Given the midfield depth, both Reyna and Malik Tillman could end up as wing options, too.

In Pulisic, you have a Champions League-level winger. In Wright, you have a dominant Championship-level winger. Outside of them, you have a few guys who struggled for consistent playing time in the Bundesliga, some MLS lifers, a guy doing well in Liga MX, a couple prospects from lower-tier European clubs and a handful of MLS prospects who haven't quite kicked on yet.

Here is my groundbreaking analysis: The USMNT should really hope that Pulisic doesn't get hurt.

1. Folarin Balogun, Monaco

2. Josh Sargent, Norwich City

3. Ricardo Pepi, PSV Eindhoven

4. JesÃºs Ferreira, FC Dallas

5. Jordan Pefok, Borussia Monchengladbach

6. Brandon VÃ¡zquez, Monterrey

7. Brian White, Montreal

8. Duncan McGuire, Orlando City

9. Johan Gomez, Eintracht Braunschweig

10. Corey Baird, FC Cincinnati

11. Nicholas Gioacchini, Como

12. Andrija Novakovich, Calcio Lecco

13. Kahveh Zahiroleslam, Sint Truiden

14. Jeremy Ebobisse, San Jose Earthquakes

15. Matthew Hoppe, Middlesbrough

After cycling through every center-forward option on the roster at the World Cup and finding none of them to be satisfactory, the USMNT's center-forward depth suddenly looks ... OK?

Balogun only played about half of the available minutes for Monaco this season. And he only scored seven goals. But he added five assists, and his underlying numbers were significantly better than his goal-scoring output. The 22-year-old averaged 3.4 shots per 90 minutes for a total of 8.5 non-penalty xG:

Per FBref's similar player algorithm, the three most similar players across Europe's Big Five leagues to Balogun are: 1) Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, 2) RB Leipzig's LoÃ¯s Openda and 3) Liverpool's Darwin NÃºÃ±ez. I'm buying low on Balogun, and it wouldn't surprise me if he had a big summer for the USMNT. Especially if Wright is more of a winger right now, Balogun should be the starter in game one of the Copa America.

Behind him, Sargent lit up the Championship for Norwich. I'm not sure he'll ever get beyond ""very good Championship attacker"" but there's nothing wrong with that -- and it certainly doesn't preclude contributing to the national team. Pepi couldn't find starter's minutes for PSV, but he consistently produced off the bench.

That's it for the Copa America candidates, but Ferreira has played well for the USMNT (even if his finishing frequently frustrates fans), Pefok got decent minutes in the Bundesliga this season, VÃ¡zquez has sometimes been great for Monterrey and White continues to be one of the most consistent attackers in MLS.

A total of 24 teams will compete for European Championship glory in Germany, with several sides having revealed either their provisional squads or indeed their final list of 26 players.

Amongst them are pre-tournament favourites England, with the likes of Adam Wharton, Jarell Quansah and Curtis Jones joining the more established talent in their 33-man provisional squad.

The biggest threats to Gareth Southgate's hopes of becoming just the second England men's manager to win a major trophy come from France, Germany, Spain and Portugal, whilst tournament dark horses such as Netherlands, Croatia and Denmark will all fancy deep runs to the latter stages of the competition.

Scotland, meanwhile, are competing in back-to-back European Championships as Steve Clarke looks to guide his side into the knockout stages of a major competition for the first time in their history.

Here is your full team-by-team guide to every country taking part at Euro 2024.

Albania, managed by former Arsenal and Manchester City player Sylvinho, topped their qualifying group ahead of the likes of Czechia and Poland to qualify for just their second-ever major tournament.

Euro 2016 saw Albania fail to advance from the group, but the Balkan country did finish the tournament on a high with a 1-0 win over Romania in their final game.

Austria finished second in qualifying under former Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick, but they look set to be without their captain and Real Madrid star David Alaba, who has missed the second part of the season with a ruptured ACL.

Their Round of 16 appearance at Euro 2020 was the furthest they have ever progressed in the competition, suffering an extra-time defeat to eventual champions Italy at Wembley.

The Red Devils made light work of qualifying under their new Italian-German manager Domenico Tedesco to seal their place at their third consecutive Euros.

Quarter-finalists in the previous two editions, Belgium will be hoping for a deeper run this time around, with a squad which is perhaps lacking some of the stardust of their golden generation in recent years but one which still possesses extreme quality - as well as a number of exciting youngsters.

Goalkeepers: Dominik Livakovic (Fenerbahce), Nediljko Labrovic (Rijeka), Ivica Ivusic (Pafos)

Defenders: Josip Stanisic (Bayer Leverkusen), Marin Pongracic (Lecce), Josko Gvardiol (Manchester City), Martin Erlic (Sassuolo), Borna Sosa (Ajax), Domagoj Vida (AEK Athens), Josip Juranovic (Union Berlin), Josip Sutalo (Ajax)

Midfielders: Lovro Majer (Wolfsburg), Mateo Kovacic (Manchester City), Luka Modric (Real Madrid), Marcelo Brozovic (Al-Nassr), Nikola Vlasic (Torino), Mario Pasalic (Atalanta), Luka Ivanusec (Feyenoord), Luka Sucic (Salzburg), Martin Baturina (Dinamo Zagreb)

Forwards: Ivan Perisic (Hajduk Split), Andrej Kramaric (Hoffenheim), Bruno Petkovic (Dinamo Zagreb), Marko Pjaca (Rijeka), Ante Budimir (Osasuna), Marco Pasalic (Rijeka)

Perennially the tournament dark horses, Croatia will be desperate to finally claim their first-ever major trophy having finished as runners-up at the 2018 World Cup and in the 2023 Nations League, as well as a third-place finish at the last World Cup in Qatar.

Captain Luka Modric will be featuring in his ninth major international tournament, with a number of his veteran teammates also likely to be playing in their swansong competition.

Czechia (Czech Republic) booked their ticket to their eighth successive European Championship with a runners-up finish in Group E.

Their squad includes West Ham stars TomÃ¡Å¡ SouÄek and VladimÃ­r Coufal, as well as promising Bayer Leverkusen youngster Adam HloÅ¾ek.

Denmark, who were beaten by England in the semi-finals of Euro 2020, qualified for this year's edition as Group H winners.

The Danes pulled off one of the biggest shocks in football history when they won Euro 92, having only qualified after Yugoslavia was disqualified because of an outbreak of war following the break-up of the country.

Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal), James Trafford (Burnley)

Defenders: Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Lewis Dunk (Brighton), Joe Gomez (Liverpool), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Jarell Quansah (Liverpool), Luke Shaw (Man Utd), John Stones (Man City), Kieran Trippier (Newcastle), Kyle Walker (Man City)

Midfielders: Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Conor Gallagher (Chelsea), Curtis Jones (Liverpool), Kobbie Mainoo (Man Utd), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace)

Forwards: Jude Bellingham, (Real Madrid), Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace), Phil Foden (Man City), Jack Grealish (Man City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), James Maddison (Tottenham), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Ivan Toney (Brentford), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)

Qualification was never really in doubt for England, who completed the double over Italy and picked up four points against Ukraine.

Despite an underwhelming March international break, and injury concerns hanging over numerous members of their squad, England should make relatively light work of their group with Italy, France and Spain potentially awaiting on their side of the draw later in the competition.

Goalkeepers: Alphonse Areola (West Ham), Mike Maignan (AC Milan), Brice Samba (Lens)

Defenders: Jonathan Clauss (Marseille), Theo Hernandez (AC Milan), Ibrahima Konate (Liverpool), Jules Kounde (Barcelona), Ferland Mendy (Real Madrid), Benjamin Pavard (Inter Milan), William Saliba (Arsenal), Dayot Upamecano (Bayern Munich)

Midfielders: Eduardo Camavinga (Real Madrid), Youssouf Fofana (Monaco), Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid), N'Golo Kante (Al-Ittihad), Adrien Rabiot (Juventus ), Aurlien Tchouameni (Real Madrid), Warren Zaire-Emery (PSG)

Forwards: Bradley Barcola (PSG), Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich), Ousmane Dembele (PSG), Olivier Giroud (AC Milan), Randal Kolo Muani (PSG), Kylian Mbappe (PSG), Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan)

France and their star-studded squad start the tournament as second favourites behind England and are looking to win their first European Championship since 2000.

Les Blues were beaten finalists in their home tournament in 2016, but recovered from the disappointment to win the the World Cup two years later.

Georgia finished fourth in qualifying, but their performances in the Nations League saw them granted a play-off berth.

The Black Sea country secured their spot at their first ever major tournament as an independent nation with a penalty shootout win over Greece. Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia will undoubtedly be one of the players to watch at Euro 2024.

Goalkeepers: Oliver Baumann (Hoffenheim), Alex Nubel (Stuttgart), Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich), Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona)

Defenders: Waldemar Anton (Stuttgart), Benjamin Henrichs (RB Leipzig), Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich), Robin Koch (Eintracht Frankfurt), Maximilian Mittelstadt (Stuttgart), David Raum (RB Leipzig), Antonio Rudiger (Real Madrid), Nico Schlotterbeck (Borussia Dortmund), Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)

Midfielders: Robert Andrich (Bayer Leverkusen), Chris Fuhrich (Stuttgart), Pascal Gross (Brighton and Hove Albion), Ilkay Gundogan (Barcelona), Toni Kroos (Real Madrid), Jamal Musiala (Bayern Munich), Aleksandar Pavlovic (Bayern Munich), Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich), Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen)

Forwards: Maximilian Beier (Hoffenheim), Niclas Fullkrug (Borussia Dortmund), Kai Havertz (Arsenal), Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich), Deniz Undav (Stuttgart)

Germany, who qualified automatically as hosts, parted company with former manager Hansi Flick in September 2023 after just four wins in 17 matches.

Results have still been mixed under Julian Nagelsamnn, who is in charge until the end of the tournament, but they still possess the quality to win their first European Championship for 28 years.

Goalkeepers: Denes Dibusz (Ferencvaros), Peter Gulacsi (RB Leipzig), Peter Szappanos (Paks)

Defenders: Botond Balogh (Parma), Endre Botka (Ferencvaros), Marton Dardai (Hertha BSC), Attila Fiola (Fehervar), Adam Lang (Omonia Nicosia), Willi Orban (RB Leipzig), Attila Szalai (Freiburg)

Midfielders: Bendeguz Bolla (Servette), Mihaly Kata (MTK), Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth), Laszlo Kleinheisler (Hajduk Split), Adam Nagy (Spezia Calcio), Zsolt Nagy (Puskas Akademia), Loic Nego (Le Havre), Andras Schafer (Union Berlin), Callum Styles (Sunderland)

Forwards: Martin Adam (Ulsan Hyundai), Kevin Csoboth (Ujpest), Daniel Gazdag (Philadelphia Union), Krisztofer Horvath (Kecskemet), Roland Sallai (Freiburg), Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool), Barnabas Varga (Ferencvaros)

Having gone 44 years without qualifying for the Euros, Hungary have now made it to their third tournament in succession and boast Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai amongst their ranks.

Hungary gave a decent account of themselves at Euro 2020, registering two draws in a group consisting of France, Germany and Portugal, but that ultimately wasn't enough to stop them finishing bottom of the pile.

Italy are the defending champions having beaten England in the final on penalties three years ago but will face a fight to qualify for the knockouts with Spain and Croatia also in Group B.

The Azzurri, who saw Roberto Mancini resign halfway through the qualifying campaign, finished as runners-up to the Three Lions, securing their spot at Euro 2024 with a draw against Ukraine on the final matchday.

Goalkeepers: Justin Bijlow (Feyenoord), Mark Flekken (Brentford), Bart Verbruggen (Brighton & Hove Albion), Nick Olij (Sparta Rotterdam)

Defenders: Nathan Ake (Manchester City), Daley Blind (Girona FC), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool), Denzel Dumfries (Inter Milan), Jeremie Frimpong (Bayer Leverkusen), Lutsharel Geertruida (Feyenoord), Matthijs de Ligt (Bayern Munich), Ian Maatsen (Borussia Dortmund), Micky van de Ven (Tottenham Hotspur), Stefan de Vrij (Inter Milan)

Midfielders: Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool), Frenkie de Jong (FC Barcelona), Teun Koopmeiners (Atalanta), Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan), Marten de Roon (Atalanta), Jerdy Schouten (PSV Eindhoven), Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig), Quinten Timber (Feyenoord), Joey Veerman (PSV Eindhoven), Georginio Wijnaldum (Al Ettifaq)

Forwards: Steven Bergwijn (Ajax), Brian Brobbey (Ajax), Memphis Depay (Atletico Madrid), Cody Gakpo (Liverpool), Donyell Malen (Borussia Dortmund), Wout Weghorst (Hoffenheim)

The Dutch finished second behind France in qualifying and they will pose a real danger in Germany, with their squad packed full of immense talent with the likes of Virgil Van Dijk, Frenkie de Jong and Xavi Simons.

Ronald Koeman is in his second spell in charge, having won the tournament as a player back in 1988 - their sole major honour to date.

Poland could only manage a distant third to Albania and Czechia in qualifying, and as such they had to settle for a spot in the play-offs to keep their Euro 2024 hopes alive.

Having dispatched Estonia 5-1 in the play-off semi-final, the Poles edged out Wales on penalties following a 0-0 draw after extra-time to qualify for their fifth consecutive major tournament.

Portugal were the only team to finish qualifying with a perfect record, winning all ten of their games with 36 goals scored and just two conceded in the process.

Now managed by former Belgium manager Roberto Martinez, Portugal will be hoping for a fairytale send-off for Cristiano Ronaldo, who will be playing in his 11th - and surely last - major international tournament.

Defenders: Antonio Silva (Benfica), Danilo Pereira (Paris St Germain), Diogo Dalot (Man Utd), Goncalo Inacio (Sporting), Joao Cancelo (Barcelona), Nelson Semedo (Wolves), Nuno Mendes (PSG), Pepe (Porto), Ruben Dias (Man City)

Midfielders: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United), Joao Neves (Benfica), Joao Palhinha (Fulham), Otavio Monteiro (Al Nassr), Ruben Neves (Al-Hilal), Vitinha (PSG)

Forwards: Bernardo Silva (Man City), Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr), Diogo Jota (Liverpool), Francisco Conceicao (Porto), Goncalo Ramos (PSG), Joao Felix (Barcelona), Pedro Neto (Wolves), Rafael Leao (AC Milan)

Romania topped Group I in qualifying to reach their first tournament since 2016 and their sixth in European Championship history.

Their heroics at Euro 2000 saw them make it out of a group consisting of England, Germany and Portugal before being beaten by Italy in the last eight.

Goalkeepers: Zander Clark (Hearts), Craig Gordon (Hearts), Angus Gunn (Norwich), Liam Kelly (Motherwell)

Defenders: Liam Cooper (Leeds United), Grant Hanley (Norwich), Jack Hendry (Al-Ettifaq), Ross McCrorie (Bristol City), Scott McKenna (Copenhagen), Ryan Porteous (Watford), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Rangers), Greg Taylor (Celtic), Kieran Tierney (Real Sociedad)

Midfielders: Stuart Armstrong (Southampton), Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Billy Gilmour (Brighton), Ryan Jack (Rangers), Kenny McLean (Norwich), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Callum McGregor (Celtic), Scott McTominay (Manchester United)

Forwards: Che Adams (Southampton), Ben Doak (Liverpool), Lyndon Dykes (Queens Park Rangers), James Forrest (Celtic), Lawrence Shankland (Hearts)

Steve Clark guided Scotland to second place in their qualifying group to make it back-to-back European Championship appearances, and their latest Euro adventure sees them kick-off against Germany in the opening fixture.

Scotland, who will have to make do without the impressive Bologna midfielder Lewis Ferguson due to injury, have never qualified from their group at a major tournament and their attempts to put their sorry record to bed will most likely be determined by the crunch clashes against Switzerland and Hungary.

Goalkeepers: Vanja Milinkovic Savic (Turin), Predrag Rajkovic (Majorca), Dorde Petrovic (Chelsea), Aleksandar Jovanovic (Partizan)

Defenders: Strahinja Pavlovic (RB Salzburg), Nikola Milenkovic (Fiorentina), Milos Veljkovic (Werder Bremen), Srdan Babic (Spartak Moscow), Uros Spajic (Red Star), Strahinja Erakovic (Zenit), Nemanja Stojic (TSC), Jan Karlo Simic (Milan)

Midfielders: Sasa Lukic (Fulham), Nemanja Gudelj (Seville), Nemanja Maksimovic (Getafe), Ivan Ilic (Torino), Sasa Zdjelar (CSKA Moscow), Srdjan Mijailovic (Red Star), Sergej Milinkovic Savic (Al Hilal), Dusan Tadic (Fenerbahce), Samed Bazdar (Partizan), Aleksandar Cirkovic (TSC), Lazar Samardzic (Udinese), Veljko Birmancevic (Sparta Prague), Filip Kostic (Juventus), Filip Mladenovic (Panathinaikos), Matija Gluscevic (RadniÄki 1923), Andrija Zivkovic (PAOK), Mijat Gacinovic (AEK), Nemanja Radonjic (Majorca)

Forwards: Aleksandar Mitrovic (Al Hilal), Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus), Luka Jovic (Milan), Petar Ratkov (RB Salzburg), Mihailo Ivanovic (Vojvodina)

Remarkably, Serbia will be competing in their first European Championship since 2000, despite having participated in four World Cups in the meantime.

Serbia were runners-up in the competition in 1960 and 1968, when they competed as part of Yugoslavia, and this generation of team is packed full of talent such as DuÅ¡an VlahoviÄ, Sergej MilinkoviÄ-SaviÄ and former Fulham striker Aleksandar MitroviÄ.

Slovakia finished a distant second behind Portugal in qualifying, with manager Francesco Calzona combining his role with the national team whilst also being the manager of Napoli in his native Italy.

Slovakia claimed the trophy as part of Czechoslovakia in 1976, with their best performance since splitting with Czechia seeing them reach the Round of 16 eight years ago, where they were beaten by Germany.

Slovenia were only beaten twice in qualifying as they finished as group runners-up, with Euro 2024 the first major tournament they will contest since the 2010 World Cup.

England will have to keep a close eye on RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko when they meet in their group fixture on June 25, with the 20 year-old regarded as one of the hottest young strikers on the continent and having been linked with some of Europe's biggest clubs.

Only Germany have taken part in more European Championships than Spain, who secured their berth at their 12th Euros having finished first in their group with seven wins from eight games in qualifying.

Luis de la Fuente, who was appointed in 2022 to replace Luis Enrique after Spain were knocked out in the World Cup Round of 16, will be hoping to guide his country to a record-breaking fourth Euros title.

Euro 2024 will see Switzerland participate in their fifth finals in the last six editions.

The Swiss produced a timeless performance to knock France out of Euro 2020 on penalties, before succumbing to spot kicks against Spain in the quarter-finals.

Vincenzo Montella's men, featuring the likes of Inter's Hakan ÃalhanoÄlu and Real Madrid wonderkid Arda GÃ¼ler, finished ahead of Croatia and Wales to finish Group D as winners.

Turkey have been knocked out in the group stage in their last two tournaments but famously made it all the way to the semi-finals in 2008, only to be beaten 3-2 by Germany in one of the all-time classic Euro games.

Goalkeepers: Andriy Lunin (Real Madrid), Anatoliy Trubin (Benfica), Heorhiy Bushchan (Dynamo Kyiv)

Forwards: Artem Dovbyk (Girona), Roman Yaremchuk (Valencia), Vladyslav Vanat (Dynamo Kyiv)

Having narrowly missed out on automatic qualification on goal difference to Italy, Ukraine produced two stirring comebacks against Bosnia and Iceland in the play-offs, with Chelsea's Mykhailo Mudryk scoring an 84th minute winner against the latter.

Ukraine will be confident of reaching the knockout stages at Euro 2024 in what will be their first appearance at a major international tournament since the Russian invasion in 2022.

With most domestic leagues across Europe now in the rear-view mirror, at least for now, attention has swiftly turned to this summer's Euro 2024 extravaganza in Germany.

The month-long tournament officially gets underway on June 14 when Scotland take on the host nation, but there are plenty of landmarks ahead of that date.

One of the most anticipated of those pre-tournament landmarks is always the squad announcement for each nation, and managers have begun naming their preliminary selections with a matter of weeks to go until things get underway.

The likes of England, France, Germany, Netherlands and more have all confirmed their initial squads, with some opting for larger rosters which they can whittle down and others choosing to stick with a smaller core group.

The final 26-man tournament squads for each nation must be announced by June 7, just one week before the on-field matters get underway in earnest.

Here, Sports Mole rounds up every nation's squad for Euro 2024.

It hasn't gotten much attention lately that the U.S. men's soccer team is about to do the most important thing it will do before cohosting the World Cup in two years.

But perhaps that will start to change soon, now that manager Gregg Berhalter has named a 27-player squad for a training camp before the Copa AmÃ©rica starts in just under a month.

Union alumni Brenden Aaronson and Mark McKenzie both made the cut after up-and-down seasons in Europe, with Aaronson's the more notable.

The Medford, N.J., native spent the campaign at Germany's Union Berlin, on loan from England's Leeds United. Union was in the Champions League for the first time, and it proved more than the team could handle. After winning the first two games of the season in August, Union didn't win again for 16 games until December.

That left Union battling relegation in the Bundesliga for much of the season. It fired two managers along the way, and escaped only on the last day of the season.

In fact, in each of Union's last two games, Aaronson was subbed off with Union ahead, and it blew the lead both times. But fate smiled on the team in its finale, when a 92nd-minute winner delivered salvation.

Union announced Monday morning that Aaronson's time in Berlin is up. The sense is that Leeds doesn't want him back, so we'll have to wait to see where he goes next.

McKenzie has two games left in his third season at Belgium's Genk. The team finished the regular season in an underwhelming sixth place, and is now in a round-robin playoff of the top six for next season's European places.

Genk is two points out of a berth in next season's Europa League, and worryingly has lost its last four games. McKenzie has played in 41 games this season, tallying 3,775 minutes, one goal, and three assists.

The U.S. camp roster is 27 players. The Copa roster can be up to 26, with 23 players on each game day squad.

There are two crucial things Berhalter must figure out. First is who will start at right back, since usual starter SergiÃ±o Dest is out with a torn ACL. Joe Scally of Germany's Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach seems likely to step in, with Shaq Moore of Nashville SC the other true right back on this squad.

Then there's striker, where Berhalter notably called in all four of his top Europe-based candidates.

Folarin Balogun is usually the starter, but had an underwhelming season at France's Monaco with just eight goals and seven assists in 32 games. Ricardo Pepi, who's also been a U.S. regular recently, had just nine goals and three assists in 41 games -- with just 764 minutes on the field -- for the Netherlands' PSV Eindhoven.

Haji Wright of England's Coventry City had the best season: 19 goals and eight assists in 50 games. He shone not just in the second-tier Championship, but in the FA Cup where Coventry almost upset mighty Manchester United in the semifinals.

Josh Sargent of England's Norwich City also had a strong campaign in the second division, with 16 goals and two assists in 30 games.

Three names initially stand out among players who weren't called in: right back Bryan Reynolds of Belgium's Westerlo, Media-born centerback Auston Trusty (another Union alum) of England's Sheffield United, and striker Brandon Vazquez of Mexico's Monterrey.

But they might be heading to the Olympics instead. In early June, the U.S. under-23 team will gather in Kansas City for its last training camp before the tournament roster is set. As the 18-man squads can have three over-age players, Trusty and Vazquez could be among the picks. Reynolds is 22, so he's age-eligible.

We'll learn more from Berhalter when he holds a news conference later Monday morning.

The Copa AmÃ©rica is South America's national team championship. It's unusual to host it outside of the continent, but when scheduled host Ecuador announced it couldn't do it, the U.S. quickly jumped in.

As the U.S. hosted a special centennial edition of the tournament in 2016, South America's confederation (CONMEBOL) knew how much money it would make by coming back here this time. Everyone involved also knew it would be a great warm-up for the World Cup.

So here they are again, with an expanded field of 16 teams like there was in 2016: 10 from South America and six from North and Central America.

The U.S.' group stage opponents will be Bolivia on June 23 in Arlington, Texas; Panama on June 27 in Atlanta; and Uruguay on July 1 in Kansas City, in what will be a huge game.

The Americans should get out of the group and reach the knockout rounds, where either Brazil or Colombia will likely await in the quarterfinals. Win that game and they'll probably face the other of those teams. Costa Rica and Paraguay are also in Brazil and Colombia's group, though they're unlikely to advance.

The quarterfinal game would be in Glendale, Ariz., or Las Vegas on July 6, and the semifinal would be in Charlotte on July 10. Charlotte also hosts the third-place game on July 13, and Miami hosts the final on July 14.

It so happens that the U.S. will face Colombia and Brazil in its pre-tournament warm-up games: Colombia on June 8 in Landover, Md., and Brazil on June 12 in Orlando.

All 24 competing nations will once again be permitted to name 26-man squads for the summer after confirmation from UEFA following pressure from numerous international managers and executives.

Some countries have made it clear when their provisional squad will be named - Gareth Southgate is to announce England's on May 21 - but the deadline for final squad submission to UEFA is June 7, a week before the tournament begins.

But who can expect to be on the plane, train, coach, group walk or other alternative means of travel? We have taken a look at the most recent squad named by each nation and tried to fill in the blanks where necessary.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against France (2-0 win) and the Netherlands (2-1 win):

Jan-Niklas Beste (Heidenheim), Aleksandar Pavlovic (Bayern Munich) and Felix Nmecha (Borussia Dortmund) were named in their most recent squad but withdrew due to injury.

The club managers of both Schar and Zakaria have declared their seasons over due to hamstring injuries but their status for Euro 2024 is unknown. Gregor Kobel (Borussia Dortmund) missed the last squad but should return, as might Breel Embolo (Monaco) as the striker is back playing again following a cruciate ligament rupture.

Etrit Berisham (Empoli), the 80-cap goalkeeper, has not featured at club level since December due to a loss of form and then injury, while Myrto Uzuni (Granada) has 11 goals in La Liga this season and dropped out of the March squad so should expect a recall.

Udogie has been ruled out after suffering a quadriceps injury in Spurs training, with Sassuolo forward Domenico Berardi, he of eight goals in 27 Italy caps and who transformed the Euro 2020 final against England before scoring the first penalty in the shootout, also sidelined.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Colombia (1-0 defeat) and Brazil (3-3 draw):

David Raya (Arsenal), Alex Remiro (Real Sociedad), Unai Simon (Athletic Bilbao), Marc Cucurella (Chelsea), Alex Grimaldo (Bayer Leverkusen), Robin Le Normand (Real Sociedad), Aymeric Laporte (Al-Nassr), Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Jesus Navas (Sevilla), Pedro Porro (Spurs), Daniel Vivian (Athletic Bilbao), Pau Cubarsi (Barcelona), Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad), Mikel Merino (Real Sociedad), Fabian Ruiz (Paris Saint-Germain), Alex Baena (Villarreal), Rodri (Manchester City), Oihan Sancet (Athletic Bilbao), Alvaro Morata (Atletico Madrid), Gerard Moreno (Villarreal), Dani Olmo (Leipzig), Nico Williams (Athletic Bilbao), Joselu (Real Madrid), Pablo Sarabia (Wolves), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Mikel Oyarzabal (Real Sociedad).

Christian Norgaard should round out the Brentford contingent after returning for his club, while Simon Kjaer (Milan) is striving to prove his fitness in time.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Brazil (1-0 defeat) and Belgium (2-2 draw):

Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal), James Trafford (Burnley), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Ben Chilwell (Chelsea), John Stones (Manchester City), Lewis Dunk (Brighton), Joe Gomez (Liverpool), Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Rico Lewis (Manchester City), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Conor Gallagher (Chelsea), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Jordan Henderson (Ajax), James Maddison (Spurs), Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Ivan Toney (Brentford), Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Marcus Rashford (Manchester United), Cole Palmer (Chelsea).

Kyle Walker (Manchester City), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) and Jack Grealish (Manchester City) can all expect to come back into the fold after brief hiatuses. The England Euros ladder should be consulted before any further questions.

Last major tournament finish: Beaten 2-1 by France in World Cup 2022 quarter-finals

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Russia (4-0 defeat) and Cyprus (1-0 win):

Predrag Rajkovic (Mallorca), Djordje Petrovic (Chelsea), Vanja Milinjovic-Savic (Torino), Strahinja Pavolvic (Salzburg), Filip Mladenovic (Panathinaikos), Nikola Milenkovic (Fiorentina), Milan Gajic (CSKA Moscow), Erhan Masovic (Bochum), Srdan Babic (Spartak Moscow), Strahinja Erakovic (Zenit Saint Petersburg), Sasa Zdjelar (CSKA Moscow), Mijat Gacinovic (AEK Athens), Dusan Tadic (Fenerbahce), Filip Kostic (Juventus), Andrija Zivkovic (PAOK), Srdan Mijailovic (Udinese), Sergej Milinkovic-Savic (Al-Hilal), Sasa Lukic (Fulham), Luka Jovic (Milan), Aleksandar Mitrovic (Al-Hilal), Samed Bazdar.

Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus) withdrew from the last squad due to injury but 13 goals in 25 games for his country make him an automatic pick if available.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Malta (2-2 draw) and Portugal (2-0 win):

Jan Oblak (Atletico Madrid), Vid Belec (APOEL), Igor Vekic (Vejle), Zan Karnicnik (Celje), Jure Balkovec (Alanyaspor), Miha Blazic (Lech Poznan), Jaka Bijol (Udinese), Erik Janza (Gornik Zabrze), Petar Stojanovic (Sampdoria), Vanja Drkusic (Sochi), David Brekalo (Orlando City), Jon Gorenc Stankovic (Sturm Graz), Benjamin Verbic (Panathinaikos), Sandi Lovric (Udinese), Timi Max Elsnik (Olimpija Ljubljana), Jasmin Kurtic (Sudtirol), Tomi Horvat (Sturm Graz), Adam Gnezda Cerin (Panathinaikos), Andraz Sporar (Panathinaikos), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig), Jan Mlakar (Pisa), Zan Vipotnik (Bordeaux), Zan Celar (Lugano), Nino Zugelj (Bodo/Glimt).

Udinese midfielder Lovric sustained a thigh injury in April and has missed the last five Serie A matches, so might not improve on his 33 caps.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Slovakia (2-0 win) and Turkey (6-1 win):

Alexander Schlager (Salzburg), Tobias Lawal (LASK), Patrick Pentz (Brondby), Maximilian Wober (Borussia Monchengladbach), Kevin Danso (Lens), Stefan Posch (Bologna), Leopold Querfeld (Rapid Wien), Phillipp Mwene (Mainz), Stefan Lainer (Borussia Monchengladbach), Flavius Daniliuc (Salzburg), Xaver Schlager (Leipzig), Nicolas Seiwald (Leipzig), Alexander Prass (Sturm Graz), Marcel Sabitzer (Borussia Dortmund), Florian Grillitsch (Hoffenheim), Patrick Wimmer (Wolfsburg), Romano Schmid (Werder Bremen), Matthias Seidl (Rapid Wien), Christoph Lang (Rapid Wien), Andreas Weimann (West Brom), Michael Gregoritsch (Frieburg), Maximilian Entrup (Hartberg), Muhammed Cham (Clermont).

The Schlagers are thought to be unlikely to make it, while David Alaba has not featured since tearing his ACL in December.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Germany (2-0 defeat) and Chile (3-2 win):

Brice Samba (Lens), Mike Maignan (Milan), Alphonse Areola (West Ham), Benjamin Pavard (Inter), Jonathan Clauss (Marseille), Dayot Upamecano (Bayern Munich), Jules Kounde (Barcelona), Ibrahima Konate (Liverpool), William Saliba (Arsenal), Lucas Hernandez (Paris Saint-Germain), Theo Hernandez (Milan), Eduardo Camavinga (Real Madrid), Matteo Guendouzi (Lazio), Aurelien Tchouameni (Real Madrid), Adrien Rabiot (Juventus), Warren Zaire-Emery (Paris Saint-Germain), Youssouf Fofana (Monaco), Olivier Giroud (Milan), Kylian Mbappe (Paris Saint-Germain), Ousmane Dembele (Paris Saint-Germain), Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain), Marcus Thuram (Inter), Moussa Diaby (Aston Villa).

Lucas Hernandez, who ruptured his right ACL within 15 minutes of the 2022 World Cup's first group game, will sit out Euro 2024 with the same injury on his left. Antoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid) should come back in and Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea) will be desperate to join him.

Last major tournament finish: Beaten on penalties by Argentina in World Cup 2022 final

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Scotland (4-0 win) and Germany (2-1 defeat):

Bart Verbruggen (Brighton), Marco Bizot (Brest), Mark Flekken (Brentford), Lutsharel Geertruida (Feyenoord), Matthijs de Ligt (Bayern Munich), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool), Nathan Ake (Manchester City), Daley Blind (Girona), Jeremie Frimpong (Bayer Leverkusen), Denzel Dumfries (Inter), Jerdy Schouten (PSV), Xavi Simons (Leipzig), Georginio Wijnaldum (Al-Ettifaq), Quinten Timber (Feyenoord), Tijani Reijnders (Milan), Marten de Roon (Atalanta), Joey Veerman (PSV), Mats Wieffer (Feyenoord), Teun Koopmeiners (Atalanta), Wout Weghorst (Hoffenheim), Memphis Depay (Atletico Madrid), Cody Gakpo (Liverpool), Donyell Malen (Borussia Dortmund).

The uncapped Ian Maatsen (Borussia Dortmund) might hope to break into the squad, as well as two-cap veteran Micky van de Ven (Spurs). Sven Botman (Newcastle) will play no part but Jurrien Timber (Arsenal) might make it.

Last major tournament finish: Beaten on penalties by Argentina in World Cup 2022 quarter-final

Last squad - named for Euro play-offs against Estonia (5-1 win) and Wales (0-0 draw, win on penalties):

Wojciech Szczesny (Juventus), Lukasz Skorupski (Bologna), Marcin Bulka (Nice), Sebastian Walukiewicz (Empoli), Pawel Dawidowicz (Verona), Tymoteusz Puchacz (Kaiserslautern), Jan Bednarek (Southampton), Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal), Bartosz Salamon (Lech Poznan), Bartosz Bereszynski (Empoli), Pawel Bochniewicz (Heerenveen), Jakub Piotrowski (Ludogorets), Bartosz Slisz (Atalanta United), Piotr Zielinski (Napoli), Kamil Grosicki (Pogon Szczecin), Taras Romanczulk (Jagiellonia Bialystok), Damian Szymanski (AEK Athens), Przemyslaw Frankowski (Lens), Sebastian Szymanski (Fenerbahce), Nicola Zalewski (Roma), Jakub Moder (Brighton), Pawel Wszolek (Legia Warsaw), Karol Swiderski (Verona), Robert Lewandowski (Barcelona), Adam Buksa (Antalyaspor), Krzysztof Piatek (Istanbul Basaksehir).

Matty Cash (Aston Villa) succumbed to a hamstring injury within 11 minutes of Poland's play-off semi-final win over Estonia, missing the subsequent victory over Wales on penalties; he will at least be in the squad.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Ireland (0-0 draw) and England (2-2 draw):

Koen Casteels (Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton), Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest), Arnaud Bodart (Standard Liege), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Arhur Theate (Rennes), Wout Faes (Leicester), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Olivier Deman (Werder Bremen), Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Koni De Winter (Genoa), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Orel Mangala (Lyon), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Aster Vranckx (Wolfsburg), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Lois Openda (Leipzig), Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Johan Bakayoko (PSV), Michy Batshuayi (Fenerbahce).

Those goalkeeping options are a sorry sight but Domenico Tedesco is ""focusing on players who are in good shape"" so will not consider Thibaut Courtois (Real Madrid) despite his consecutive clean sheets in May. Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City) should await a pleasant phone call, however.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Northern Ireland (1-1 draw) and Colombia (3-2 defeat):

Florin Nita (Gaziantep), Horatiu Moldovan (Atletico Madrid), Stefan Tarnovanu (FCSB), Marian Aioani (Rapid Bucuresti), Andrei Burca (Al-Okhdood), Ionut Nedelcearu (Palermo), Cristian Manea (CFR Cluj), Adrian Rus (Pafos), Andrei Ratiu (Rayo Vallecano), Deian Sorescu (Gaziantep), Radu Dragusin (Spurs), Vasile Mogos (CFR Cluj), Raul Oprut (Hermannstadt), Bogdan Racovitan (Rakow Czestochowa), Nicolae Stanciu (Damac), Razvan Marin (Empoli), Alexandru Cicaldau (Konyaspor), Ianis Hagi (Alaves), Dennis Man (Parma), Valentin Mihaila (Parma), Darius Olaru (FCSB), Marius Marin (Pisa), Olimpiu Morutan (Ankaragucu), Florinel Coman (FCSB), Denis Dragus (Gaziantep), Adrian Sut (FCSB), George Puscas (Bari), Denis Alibec (Muaither), Florin Tanase (Al-Okhdood).

Morutan will not be involved after rupturing his Achilles, while Nicusor Bancu (Universitatea Craiova) pulled out of the March squad but has featured heavily for his club since.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Austria (2-0 defeat) and Norway (1-1 draw):

Marek Rodak (Fulham), Henrich Ravas (New England Revolution), Dominik Takac (Spartak Trnava), Peter Pekarik (Hertha BSC), Norbert Gyomber (Salernitana), David Hancko (Feyenoord), Lubomir Satka (Samsunspor), Denis Vavro (Copenhagen), Vernon De Marco (Hatta), Michal Tomic (Slavia Prague), Adam Obert (Cagliari), Matus Kmet (AS Trencin), Juraj Kucka (Slovan Bratislava), Ondrej Duda (Verona), Patrik Hrosovsky (Genk), Stanislav Lobotka (Napoli), Laszlo Benes (Hamburg), Erik Jirka (Viktoria Plzen), Jakub Kadak (Luzern), Dominik Holly (AS Trencin), Robert Mak (Sydney FC), Robert Bozenik (Boavista), Lukas Haraslin (Sparta Prague), Tomas Suslov (Verona), Ivan Schranz (Slavia Prague), David Strelec (Slovan Bratislava), David Duris (Ascoli), Robert Polievka (Dukla Banska Bystrica), Lubomir Tupta (Slovan Liberec), Leo Sauer (Feyenoord).

Martin Dubravka (Newcastle) and Milan Skriniar (Paris Saint-Germain) should both be drafted in again to help shore up the defence.

Last squad - named for Euro play-offs against Bosnia (2-1 win) and Iceland (2-1 win):

Heorhiy Buschchan (Dynamo Kyiv), Andriy Lunin (Real Madrid), Anatoliy Trubin (Benfica), Mykola Matviyenko (Shakhtar Donetsk), Vitaliy Mykolenko (Everton), Illya Zabarnyi (Bournemouth), Oleksandr Tymchyk (Dynamo Kyiv), Yukhym Konoplya (Shakhtar Donestk), Bohdan Mykhaylichenko (Polissya Zhytomyr), Valeriy Bondar (Shakhtar Donetsk), Maksym Talovyerov (LASK), Oleksandar Zinchenko (Arsenal), Serhiy Sydorchu (Westerlo), Ruslan Malinovskyi (Genoa), Viktor Tsyhankov (Girona), Oleksandr Zubkov (Shakhtar Donetsk), Mykola Shaparenko (Dynamo Kyiv), Mykhaylo Mudrk (Chelsea), Heorhiy Sudakov (Shakhtar Donestk), Volodymyr Brazhko (Dynamo Kyiv), Roman Yaremchuk (Valencia) Artem Dovbyk (Girona), Vladyslav Vanat (Dynamo Kyiv).

There is not a great deal of movement from Ukraine, whose biggest question is whether captain Andriy Yarmolenko (Dynamo Kyiv) has done enough to justify another few caps after an Achilles injury.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Norway (2-1 win) and Armenia (2-1 win):

Jindrich Stanek (Slavia Prague), Vitezslav Jaros (Sturm Graz), Matej Kovar (Bayer Leverkusen), Tomas Holes (Slavia Prague), David Zima (Slavia Prague), Jaroslav Zeleny (Sparta Prague), Ladislav Krejci (Sparta Prague), David Doudera (Slavia Prague), David Jurasek (Hoffenheim), Adam Gabriel (Midtjylland), Robin Hranac (Viktoria Plzen), Tomas Vicek (Slavia Prague), Tomas Soucek (West Ham), Antonin Barak (Fiorentina), Michal Sadilek (Twente), Lukas Provod (Slavia Prague), Ondrej Lingr (Feyenoord), Matej Jurasek (Slavia Prague), Pavel Sulc (Viktoria Plzen), Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen), Adam Hlozek (Bayer Leverkusen), Mojmir Chytil (Slavia Prague), Tomas Chory (Viktoria Plzen).

Vladimir Coufal (West Ham), Jan Kuchta (Sparta Prague) Jakub Brabec (Aris) have not been selected since they were found to have 'fundamentally violated the internal rules of the national team' by drinking in a nightclub shortly before a Euros qualifier in November.

Last squad - named for Euro play-offs against Luxembourg (2-0 win) and Greece (0-0 draw, win on penalties):

Giorgi Loria (Dinamo Tbilisi), Giorgi Mamardashvili (Valencia), Luka Gugeshashvili (Qarabag), Otar Kakabadze (Cracovia), Lasha Dvali (APOEL), Guram Kashia (Slovan Bratislava), Solomon Kvirkvelia (Al-Okhdood), Giorgio Gocholeishvili (Shakhtar Donetsk), Luka Lochoshvili (Cremonese), Giorgio Gvelesiani (Persepolis), Vladimer Mamuchashvili (Dinamon Batumi), Saba Sazonov (Torino), Giorgi Kochorashvili (Levante), Zuriko Davitashvili (Bordeaux), Giorgi Chakvetadze (Watford), Nika Kvekveskiri (Lech Poznan), Otar Kiteishvili (Sturm Graz), Sandro Altunashvili (Wolfsberger), Levan Shengelia (Panetolikos), Jaba Kankava (Slovan Bratislava), Giorgi Tsitaishvili (Dinamo Batumi), Anzor Mekvabishvili (Universitatea Craiova), Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Napoli), Budu Zivzivadze (Karlsruher), Giorgi Kvilitaia (APOEL), Georges Mikautadze (Metz).

There shouldn't be too much change expected on the squad named to secure qualification, with Giorgi Aburjania (Hatayspor) and Saba Lobzhanidze (Atlanta United) and their combined 75 caps on the midfield fringes.

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Sweden (5-2 win) and Slovenia (2-0 defeat):

Rui Patricio (Roma), Jose Sa (Wolves), Diogo Costa (Porto), Samuel Soares (Benfica), Diogo Dalot (Manchester United), Pepe (Porto), Antonio Silva (Benfica), Diogo Leite (Union Berlin), Danilo Pereira (Paris Saint-Germain), Goncalo Inacio (Sporting), Joao Mario (Porto), Nuno Mendes (Paris Saint-Germain), Joao Cancelo (Barcelona), Ruben Dias (Manchester City), Nelson Semedo (Wolves), Toti Gomes (Wolves), Joao Neves (Benfica), Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United), Otavio (Al-Nassr), Ruben Neves (Al-Hilal), Vitinha (Paris Saint-Germain), Bernardo Silva (Manchester City), Joao Palhinha (Fulham), Matheus Nunes (Manchester City), Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr), Dany Mota (Monza), Joao Felix (Barcelona), Jota Silva (Vitoria Guimaraes), Bruma (Braga), Francisco Conceicao (Porto), Rafael Leao (Milan), Goncalo Ramos (Paris Saint-Germain).

Raphael Guerreiro (Bayern Munich), Francisco Trincao (Sporting), Pedro Neto (Wolves) and Diogo Jota (Liverpool) have all been part of recent squads before withdrawing due to injury. Fernandes might be keeping himself fresh by evading his Manchester United conscription, if we read between Wayne Rooney's lines.

Last major tournament finish: Beaten 1-0 by Morocco in World Cup 2022 quarter-final

Last squad - named for March friendlies against Hungary (1-0 defeat) and Austria (6-1 defeat):
