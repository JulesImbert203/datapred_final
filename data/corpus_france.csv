According to him, this ""diplomatic permission"" is simply an application of the law.

""A country that has been attacked can retaliate against centers of military aggression in another territory,"" Lecornu said.

""It is Russia that is changing its way of waging war and in particular by retreating behind its border. So it is Russia that has also carried this risk of seeing its own territory struck. The roles must not be reversed,"" the minister added.

Lecornu also stressed that 'weapons given to Ukraine allow Ukraine to defend itself and this does not make France a co-belligerent power.""

Editorial credit: Wafa

In the early morning of Friday 12 April, an incident occurred in the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Achimeir, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, went missing while tending to a flock of sheep near his family's illegal settlement, the 2015-established ""Malachei Hashalom"". [1]

ContentsWhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destructionZionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active supportAnalysisAlso read

The disappearance of the boy, which was initially suspected to be a kidnapping, prompted an extensive search involving Israeli authorities, the military, and numerous settlers.

However, it took 24 hours before Achimeir's body was discovered near the ""outpost"", signalling the start of a sequence of events that would lead to a deadly escalation of violence. [2]

WhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""

Israeli authorities state that Achimeir was killed on that particular morning, although it took some time for his body to be found. They inaccurately concluded that he was killed in a ""terror attack"". [1]

Simultaneously, disturbing messages started circulating within settler WhatsApp groups, encouraging retaliatory attacks on neighbouring Palestinian villages.

These messages, originating from individuals with extreme views, promoted activities such as obstructing villages, conducting house-to-house searches, and imposing collective penalties on Palestinians.

One such message, attributed to the terrorist Elisha Yered -- a former spokesman for MP Limor Son Har-Melech and extreme settler suspected in the murder of a Palestinian man last August -- called for ""crowning"" nearby Palestinian villages. [3]

In addition, he urged fellow occupiers to conduct ""home to home searches,"" and impose ""collective punishment against the murderous Arab population."" [3]

This message contained a list of meeting points, some of which were marked with fire emojis, indicating potential targets for violence. [4]

Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destruction

The response to Achimeir's death was immediate and brutal.

In the following days, settlers carried out shooting and arson attacks against Palestinian neighbourhoods. Homes were set ablaze, cars were set on fire, and lives were lost.

According to Palestinian officials and witnesses, the attacks were highly organised and targeted specific individuals and groups near the illegal settler community.

In al-Mughayyir village, which is close to Achimeir's ""outpost"", residents said they were pelted with stones, burned cars, and shot at by armed settlers as they tried to defend their homes. [3]

A BBC report noted that construction worker Abdellatif Abu Aliya's house was stormed by settlers. They damaged his property and killed his cousin, Jihad.

''The settlers cut the electricity to the house and drained the property's water tanks by shooting them.

""Jihad, who had come to defend the house, threw rocks back from the roof towards the settlers. But the settlers returned gunfire, killing Jihad with a shot to the head.'' [3]

In other villages, similar scenes played out, with innocent Palestinian families caught in the middle of settler reprisals.

50-year-old Shehade Abu Rasheed's family suffered attacks on their home. His daughter, Noor, was shot twice in the legs while seeking refuge with her wounded mother. [3]

Another young villager, 17-year-old Yaqoub Nasan, was shot multiple times in the neck while he was unarmed. [3]

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 32 people in al-Mughayyir were wounded by gunfire. By Saturday afternoon, after the body of Achimeir was discovered, two more Palestinians had been killed. In property damage, more than 20 houses and 100 vehicles had been set ablaze. [3]

Zionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active support

In the wake of the violence, lives were lost, houses were destroyed, and entire communities were traumatised.

At the same time, the Israeli regime came under criticism for its failure to prevent the violence and to hold the perpetrators of the attacks accountable. In addition, some of the attacks were unsurprisingly carried out by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). [5]

According to one family's video, armed settlers were seen walking around their property before the attack began. At least two of them were wearing what appear to be IDF uniforms.

Abu Aliya said,

""They worked in groups and were following orders from two men, one in uniform and one not. They covered their faces, then one group came forward to throw rocks and set fire to the cars.

""Another group stood at the edge of the property with pistols. Behind them was a group with M16s who fired at the house from the olive groves."" [3]

The involvement of soldiers in some of the attacks, which were witnessed by the villagers and recorded on video, has added to the complexity of the situation.

But as the dust begins to settle in the wake of these terrible events, it is essential that the voices of the victims must not be silenced.

The Palestinian villagers who have suffered the most from settler violence deserve recognition and assistance as they begin to rebuild their lives after what they have endured.

Similarly, justice and human rights advocates who are fighting for peace and reconciliation must continue to stand up against Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people.

Analysis ANALYSIS Shaheer Choudhury Head of Editorial

Pay attention to the entire Palestinian cause!

Over the past (nearly) eight months, the world has taken a painstaking amount of time to recognise the true situation in the Gaza Strip.

In that time, the Zionist entity has been unleashing untold mayhem upon the Palestinians, with tens of thousands of women and children killed under the pretext of eliminating Hamas.

Arguably, this is one of the most foolish positions that an authoritarian, oppressive, occupying power has ever held in recent history. One cannot simply eradicate the hearts and minds that yearn to resist occupation and that understand defeat is not in the least in the loss of people or property.

Imagine if the situation was reversed

Our role as Muslims in the West must be to continue to speak out about the situation of the whole of Palestine, all of the occupied territories, all of those who we know to be languishing behind bars, and all of those who have gone missing.

Illegal settlers -- such as those who responded with barbarism to the death of one boy -- question why Palestinian resistance fighters are determined to protect their homeland, but they will never see how the situation is many times worse for them.

It is not right that Benjamin Achimeir has been killed -- according to Israeli sources, by a Palestinian hand -- but this level of response is a microcosm of what the Zionist regime has been doing in Gaza.

And this is while vast parts of Palestine are illegally occupied, have been occupied, and more areas are being stolen as we speak. The international community recognises the illegality, and yet barely anything is mentioned about such cases.

Pro-palestinian protesters, their joint by labour region, faculty and staff as a defiant trespass order to leave king's college circle and cp24 says it does get is live at u of t with the latest lindsay. >> Yeah, that rally wrapped up this morning. A car in the latest now is that the university says it's going to file an injunction to have these protesters removed from the encampment. And we do have a statement from the university released just last hour or so, every part of that for you now it says the notice of motion is proceeding normally and will be accessible through the usual process once it's filed off the court at 3.30 university avenue. We continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment and hope they will bring the unauthorized encampment to a peaceful and so the encampment here today, obviously, has not been dismantled yet. And students say they are not leaving bakari until the university has their 3 main demands. And we did hear from air maki who has become one of the spokes peers, people for the encampments. And she was talking a little bit more about the negotiations that are still continuing between the university and students. And also why students are staying here. Have a listen to what she had to say. My is being used to fund the development of weapons and bombs that are being dropped on the palestinian people. >> Which is why we're here, which is why, you know, we have no other choice but to continue these negotiations. And so, you know, the injunction was on pause until tomorrow. The court said that, yeah, they're going to postpone the hearing until tomorrow. So we'll have to kind of wait and see. But this evening at 5:00, we have another meeting with the administration to hopefully get them to commit to divestment. >> United will never be defeated. >> So if there is, as you potential for maybe a peaceful resolution, bakari, between the university and the students negotiations continue tonight, starting at 5:00. In the meantime, we're waiting to hear when that court date could be scheduled, usually after an injunction is filed. It's 24 to 48 hours afterwards. So could possibly be tomorrow or the day after that. The university has been wanting these protesters to dismantle their encampment over the last 25 days because they say it's causing some safety concerns for other students who are on campus who feel unsafe. But again, the protesters here say they have no plans to do until the university meets their demands preparing. Okay, continuing our coverage live from. >> King's college circle.

Organizers say that today's demonstration was meant to show that show this school students, staff and families that the community stands with him. >> Oftentimes you stories on the news its ads and try to be empathetic when it's at home. It's a whole different this is not close to home. This is I spent many hours here day and and it was pretty shocking. >> I'm here to stand with you to say that anti-semitism, it's like cancer. We have to say no. It erodes the boss of empathy and compassion between people. Is saying no to decay over so side into hate and out and absolutely have no place in toronto. >> Let me make this clear and I'm sure many of you agree, we will not be intimidated. We live in the city. We helped build this city and we plan to stay. >> People come to toronto from all over the world to escape conflict zones to escape hate. We don't want your vile hate here. We're a city of peace and respect. >> Communities then strong, we teach that everybody's there for each other and that's how we have to stand together unity in one and show that if you hurt one, you hurt us all. >> Archie was can be stronger united and we take care of each other and we know that we have many friends and allies are going to be here with us as well, who also take care of us and support us. But really, we're trying to send a wake-up call to all of toronto. What's

happening in our city is scary. It's unacceptable impacts real lives. There are children who are affected by this and we need all over all of our neighbours of all communities stand with us and say hate against any community, including the 2 has no place in the city. >> Well, police have said that it's too early to determine if the shooting as a hate crime or act of terrorism, but noted that the hate crime unit is supporting the investigation. Residents in some neighbourhoods, they've been told to expect an increased police presence. 35 20 degrees right now. Let's get early look at the roads this afternoon with traffic specialist adwoa nsiah-yeboah good afternoon been watching this long-standing problem through milton involving a collision involving a jackknifed transport truck. It looks like things are. >> Starting to slowly get better. That truck is completely out of the ditch about some good news. Unfortunately from westbound for one approaching highway. 25 still, hov lane continues to squeeze by and a bit of a delay on the approach. But the good news, we had some problems on the eastbound lanes of the 401. It was only approach to dixie actually past dixie in the express that collision. It did clear problems persist. So eastbound for one, as you make a way to scarborough to kennedy collision involving a truck does have the right lane and the on ramp from kennedy to the eastbound 4, 1, it's also occupied promise to deal with as well. This is on the northbound lanes of the don valley parkway lawrence collision still there in the left lane. And we're getting word of some flooding. This is on the niagara-bound lanes of the qew approaching here. Ontario until on scene blocking the right lane. The flooding is actually at the end of the on ramp from your ontario. So that's also adding to a very slow commute. A reminder eastbound 4, 1, at highway 6 north collision cleanup in the 2 right lanes. And if your travels that do take it to city streets. Crews on scene of a collision on the lakeshore and I'll send it back to you. Bakari. Thanks a lot. Toronto is launching a partnership that aims to address its transportation challenges. Split. >> Cutting edge technology. The city signed a memorandum of understanding with the ontario vehicle innovation network. It's going to provide eligible companies with up to $100,000 in funding to test traffic management act, which utilizes 5 eur connectivity along with artificial intelligence. The city says that the agreement supports the congestion management plan council adopted last year. Siemiatycki, professor of geography and planning as well as director of infrastructure and university of toronto joined cp24 live at noon was more on how this project could help with the city's traffic woes. >> There have been dreams going back decades that we have automated traffic lights, that it would be able to make sure that when you're coming to the light is always green for you. But keep in mind when it screened for us red for someone else and that's always been a challenge, perhaps with new ai technologies. They can get more efficient. We think we can squeeze more efficiency out of the network. But overall, we have too many cars for not enough road space. This will make some difference, but it's not going to transform the gridlock that we're experiencing today. >> The pilot project is going to start in the summer at some toronto's busiest intersections. City staff are expected to report back on some of the findings at the end of the year. Well, we are following a developing story this afternoon. Boy is dead after shooting in the east end police. They continued investigation warden avenue in kenner, acting president. This is north of danforth road to say that a male youth was shot at 1:00 this morning.

Meanwhile, Blue Capsule has signed a partnership agreement with the French Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission, from which it was spun off, for the development of its small modular reactor.

Thorizon - a spin-off from NRG, which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten - is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe molten salt reactor (MSR), targeted at large industrial customers and utilities. Thorizon aims to construct a pilot reactor system before 2035.

MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.

The molten salt fuel adopted by Thorizon uses a combination of long-lived elements from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and thorium. The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.

Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.

Thorizon said it will ""benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers"".

""The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,"" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. ""We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.""

""It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,"" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. ""Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.""

Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that ""can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source"". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.

Decarbonising industry

Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.

Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.

Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.

""France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,"" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. ""And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.

""This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.

""It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.""

Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1372549019607843,454689557,1,,

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture.

Photos show the aftermath. The water had been high enough to make appliances float and left everything caked in mud. His estimated restoration cost, $143,000, taxes in. His insurance capped at 50,000. >> I took 50,000 off the 143, left me with 90,000 and change. >> Reporter: then he applied to nova scotia's disaster financial assistance program. But after months of waiting and piles of paperwork, he was offered $6,000. He appealed and was then offered 15,000. At 74 years old, he's taken out a second mortgage to pay for the $60,000 he has left. >> What would you say if somebody said, we're going to put your home back to the way it originally was. Just pay my contractor's bill. That's all I want. >> Reporter: the province is still processing more than 500 disaster assistance applications from the floods. 1,100 have been paid out to the tune of $14 million. >> For the ones that haven't been paid out, we're certainly sympathetic. We know it's been traumatic for them, but it's been challenging for us too. >> Flooding is the costlyiest costliest in terms of property damage. >> We're expecting more short duration intense rainfall events, and everyone knows examples of those across canada. >> My doctors increased a lot of my medications. >> Reporter: the stress has taken its toll on clinten.

The plan involves 18-year-olds choosing to either enlist in the military or perform community work. But the proposal could remain just that if sunak's political fortunes don't improve fast. Redmond shannon explains. >> We will have a general election on the 4th of july. >> Reporter: the timing of rishi sunak's election call surprised many. As has his first big campaign announcement. >> We will introduce a bold new model of national service for 18-year-olds. >> Reporter: the plan would see teens choose between a year in the military or complete 12 weekends of community work across a year. The vast majority would do the latter. Sunak claims it would help society and national security. These 16-year-olds, who can't vote yet, could be among the first to be enrolled. >> I found it on tiktok in the morning, and my parents are speaking about it. >> What are your parents saying? >> It was divided. My dad thought rishi sunak's idea was good. But my mom thought otherwise. >> I really don't want rishi sunak to win. Especially hearing what he's done with this now. >> Reporter: it's 64 years since britain has had national service, but with the governing tories far behind in the polls, this could be seen as a hail mary pass to appeal to disillusioned voters. 80-year-old peter lions remembers his uncle being called up to serve. He says the plan is a reflection of global instability >> They're certainly working up to the fact that the british armed forces are not anywhere near prepared to fight a war anywhere. >> Reporter: this former social worker believes it's purely election politics. >> I think it's a gimmick, you know. It will never see the light of day. I think it's just clutching at straws. I think if you really care about young people's welfare, you would invest properly in education. >> Reporter: the idea is far from unique in europe.

They're usually made up of wood chips, shavings, bark, and sawdust. This alternative form of energy is meant to divert millions of tonnes of waste from landfills, but as paul johnson explains, it's the way B.C. is producing wood pellets that have some environmentalists concerned. >> Reporter: you're watching a long-form investigative news story about alleged environmental problems with the wood pellet industry in the interior of B.C. >> They've breached canadian environmental regulations 189 times. >> Reporter: this program, though, was not broadcast in canada but was produced by the bbc of the U.K. >> As it turns out, the environmental and forest policies at play here in british columbia, alberta, and across canada are actually a huge point of contention right now in the united kingdom. >> Reporter: stand.earth force campaigner teagan hansen says what got B.C. on the radar scene in britain is the drax power station. Hansen says the brits uncovered dozens of emissions violations at drax's plants in the interior. >> In some cases, emissions were twice the allowed limit. In one case, the emissions were tripled the allowed limit. >> Reporter: aside from the air quality issues, what troubles conservationists in the U.K. and here is the extent to which drax may be turning whole logs into fuel pellets, which could undermine the company's self-proclaimed status of a green and renewable business. While drax told global its primary feedstock is residue from sawmills, hansen says she's seen whole logs herself at their facilities. >> I've walked around these pellet plants. I've seen these enormous piles of logs. Anyone who goes to a pellet plant knows that they're grinding trees to turn into pellets. >> Reporter: b.c.'s forests minister told global news that our old growth forests are not being turned into pellets. And on the emissions problem, drax told us they've all been minor and that they've been working to raise standards on the plants they've acquired in B.C. paul johnson, global news. >> Jeff: mexico is sweltering in an intense heat wave. Dozens of people have died from the so-called heat dome, and the most intense temperatures are yet to come. Mexicans are facing bone-dry conditions and serious water shortages. Water delivery has become a critical service in mexico city where temperatures could hit 35°. That's far hotter than what the capital is used to, and unbearable in a city where only the well-off have air conditioning.

It has been broadcasting over private 5G for 10 hours per day since May 9, covering the Olympic torch's journey of 1,625 kilometres.

The footage has been shown on the dedicated france.tv PARIS 2024 channel. France Télévisions said it selected 5G for an ""entirely cloud-based audiovisual production"" for its ""reliable, compact, high-speed, and ultra-secure"" delivery, and to meet its ""commitment to energy and environmental conservation"".

The broadcaster is using a private 5G product, called a 'bubble' Dome, from French start-up Obvios; it has also worked with US-based broadcast technology company TVU Networks and France-based system integrator TDF Group, which handled technical aspects of the ""mobile units"" carrying the 5G cells, edge compute, and broadcast software.

Satellite operator Starlink is also involved, apparently. France Télévisions said the solution has avoided ""several dozen metric tons of CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods"" - by connecting a high-fidelity video stream on a lightweight mobile 5G setup to a central control room without trucking lots of equipment about.

The Dome unit can be deployed in the trunk of a car, said Obvios, and does away with ""heavy [and] costly resources"" (such as production vans and helicopters"") to cover events of this scale.

It stated: ""This minimalist device revolutionizes the way production teams work. Live feeds, multi-camera production, graphics management, commentary, audio mixing, intercommunication between teams, broadcasting: everything can be controlled remotely from the Paris headquarters of the French audiovisual group.""

Nicolas Dallery, vice president of marketing and sales at Obvios, said: ""Our private 5G connectivity bubble is robust and maintains a perfect signal on the move. It overcomes the problems of coverage and saturation of public networks. That's the strength of a private 5G network.""

Romuald Rat, director of TechLab and AI at France Télévisions, said: ""Through this collaboration... [we] are setting a new standard for the future - one that prioritizes innovation, sustainability and the power of cloud technology to produce closer to events and bring fans closer to the action.""",rcrwireless.com,news,RCR Wireless News,James Blackman,0.0980392156862746,454861665,6,https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Olympics.jpg,

""Ukraine has every right to retaliate,"" Lecornu said, adding that ""there is nothing new here in terms of international law.""

According to him, this ""diplomatic permission"" is simply an application of the law.

""A country that has been attacked can retaliate against centers of military aggression in another territory,"" Lecornu said.

""It is Russia that is changing its way of waging war and in particular by retreating behind its border. So it is Russia that has also carried this risk of seeing its own territory struck. The roles must not be reversed,"" the minister added.

Lecornu also stressed that 'weapons given to Ukraine allow Ukraine to defend itself and this does not make France a co-belligerent power.""

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Many studies have shown this disorder has consequences that last decades after pregnancy, with an increased risk of cardiovascular and kidney morbidity and mortality in individuals with a history of preeclampsia. Recently, those with preeclampsia were described as having a 3-fold higher risk of late-onset vascular dementia after a mean follow-up of 20 years. This cohort study investigated whether preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) were associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia years after the pregnancy.

Data were obtained from the Conception study, a nationwide prospective cohort study using data from the French National Health Insurance Information System. This database included all deliveries in France after 22 weeks' gestation between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018. The French National Public Health Agency has permanent access to the pseudonymized health care reimbursement data in application of the provisions of the French Public Health Code and authorization to perform studies from the French Data Protection Authority, with rules and criteria similar to the Declaration of Helsinki. The French Data Protection Authority approved this study and waived the informed consent requirement because it used anonymized data.

All individuals aged 30 years or older without a history of dementia were identified and followed-up from delivery to December 31, 2021. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models. In all models, exposures to HDPs were treated as time-varying variables and maternal age as a time scale. Models were adjusted for obesity, diabetes, tobacco smoking, drug or alcohol addiction, and social deprivation. Data analysis was performed between March and July 2023 using SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS).

Of the 1 966 323 individuals (mean [SD] maternal age, 34.6 [3.3] years) included, 128 (<1%) developed dementia. Dementia was identified using primary diagnosis for hospitalization during a mean (SD) follow-up of 9.0 (2.6) years. Patients who developed young-onset dementia were older (36.4 years vs 34.6 years), were more frequently socially deprived (13.3% vs 12.0%), were smokers (14.8% vs 9.0%), and had diabetes (2.3% vs 0.7%) compared with those without dementia (Table 1). Preeclampsia was associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia compared with pregnancy without HDP (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.34-5.25) (Table 2). Risk of young-onset dementia was even higher when preeclampsia occurred before 34 weeks' gestation (HR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.30-13.14) or was superimposed on chronic hypertension (HR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.49-15.22). In contrast, severe preeclampsia was not associated with young-onset dementia.

Although earlier studies have already reported cognitive function impairment and white matter lesions associated with preeclampsia, the present study is the first to show an increase in early-onset dementia risk. The results suggested a dose-dependent association, with higher HRs for early-onset preeclampsia and superimposed preeclampsia. The nonsignificant result regarding severe preeclampsia could be associated with the low statistical power in this subgroup, adding to the currently limited knowledge about risk factors of young-onset dementia. A study limitation was that the identification of dementia by hospital diagnosis may have substantially underestimated the incidence of this disease.

More studies are needed to confirm these initial findings and to ascertain whether preeclampsia is an independent risk factor for dementia and whether preeclampsia and young-onset dementia share common risk factors or a physiological susceptibility to dementia unmasked by pregnancy. The results add early-onset preeclampsia to the list of lifelong disease risks or health care implications of having had preeclampsia.

Eastpointe / Kirthmon F. Dozier via Imagn Content

Roseville High School head coach Vernard Snowden has sent numerous players to the Big Ten and Mid-American conferences, among many others. He knows plenty about making it to the college level.

The Wayne State National College 2-Day Showcase began on Wednesday. Snowden, along with more than a dozen of his players, is attending the event with one thought in mind.

""Competing,"" Snowden told Spartan Nation. ""That's our culture, it's to compete, so, just going out there and competing against other guys across not just the state, but the country, in front of [all] of the college coaches that are gonna be there. So definitely, the attribute of competing.

"" ... We don't prepare for showcases, [the players] just do what they do, they had a good offseason, we don't prepare them for a showcase, they just get out there and compete.""

Snowden said that for the fringe players that have FCS or Division II offers but are looking to break out and receive Power Four or Group of Five recognition, the approach is simple.

""Compete,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, they go out and compete because ... just about every college in the country is going to be there, and if you can compete against a guy who is a four- or five-star with X amount of Division I offers, and you compete against that individual, that can show the college coaches a little more ability that you have. We do tell [our players] just to compete, just stand out amongst the rest, right, whenever the opportunities come, get your reps, and just compete.""

Top Michigan State 2025 target Desmond Straughton has been at the event.

The showcase is two days long and will take place in front of 60-plus college coaches across different levels of college football. Michigan State and Michigan will be in attendance, along with fellow Big Ten schools like Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, and Penn State, among others. SEC schools like Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Missouri will be there.

In-state Division II powerhouses Ferris State and Grand Valley will be among the non-Division I schools.

The first day will consist of testing -- the 40-yard dash, shuttle drills -- and measurements gauging the height and weight of the players. Day 2 is the day when players can really make their name known in position drills and one-on-ones.

In other words -- compete.

Just maybe you want to bolster what I was just saying, julia, what stood out to you as you listened to what the president was laying out there. >> Perhaps not a big surprise with the verdict but still a stark assessment of the situation in gaza, particularly since israel started its offensive in rafah. Just a couple of weeks ago. And the deterioration as the president of the international court was painting a picture of a very difficult situation in terms of the humanitarian conditions on the ground, and he was referencing particularly the facts that there had been evacuation orders issued in advance by israel, warning that it was going into rafah, that led to the displacement of some 800,000 people, according to the united nations. And what I think was interesting from this ruling was the fact that the judges found that that wasn't good enough, the fact that there had been advance warning. They said that the situation to where -- where the people had been moved to simply wasn't good enough, they were living without roofs, without water, without any kind of sanitary conditions, and of course very limited access to aid, which is why the icj has made its judgment that the rafah crossing needs to be reopened. We've been hearing major concerns about the fact that since israel took control of the gaza side of that crossing, there hasn't been any aid coming from egypt into gaza over the last couple of weeks. And although there are other routes and israel has insisted that it isn't blocking aid, that's been a major sticking point for aid groups where we heard the judges talking about the world food program, not having access to a warehouse in rafah as well. So a really stark picture of what's going on there, but, yes, the headlines effectively that the court is ordering israel to halt its rafah offensive, open the rafah crossing and allow investigators in to ensure that israel is complying with an order from earlier in the year by the icj that it meets to prevent a genocide in gaza. >> Heather: just again, getting a little bit of context to all of this, again, ordering the stop to the rafah incursion, some had expected the icj could go even further and order a stop to the entire wars the entire offensive in gaza broadly, that has not happened, nor did it happen with the initial ruling back in january. So this is rafah specific. Interesting that the votes in all of these were 13-2, and the american representative on the international court who's a justice by the name of sarah haul cleveland, she voted were the majority, so she voted in favour of these provisional measures. In terms of the southwestern ontario come of this, this is legally bind bug there is no power to enforce these orders from the international court of justice. By way of understanding, this is brought by south africa, it's part of the larger case, south africa alleges that israel has been involved in acts of genocide. It filed that back last december and this is part of what's making its way through the international court of justice. The main case which deals with that main accusation of genocide it's not expected to start until next we are. Israel has of course denied the case, but this is part of that within what is being investigated and that's part of the, as you said, julia, must be open to any investigators lookings at some of these allegations and looking for evidence. So this is the context to the ruling today. We already know, again, not able to be enforced, israel has already made it clear it will nod adhere to this, whatever it was going to be. No power on earth will stop israel from protecting its citizens and going after hamas in gaza. That's what a government spokesperson has already said. So what is this likely to lead to, as far as israel's response, and I would also like you to look, julia, if you could, to how the world will respond, the kind of isolation, the kind of criticism that we may hear as a result of what the icj has just ruled. >> Well, absolutely. I mean, israel did defend itself at the court last week because it is a member of the united nations and it has to effectively put forward its rebuttal to the south african allegations, so certainly it has been participating in these proceedings and although they are legally binding, as you say, incredibly difficult to enforce on the ground, south africa continuing to press israel on its actions in gaza and although the broader genocide case could take many years, it wants to see pressure put on israel at every stage, particularly as the situation on the ground is evolving. Certainly, we have seen israel already dismiss international courts' efforts to intervene in gaza, saying that israel didn't start this war, it didn't want this war, and it needs to carry out its offensive, it says, in rafah because it's -- the last stronghold of hamas. It says that's necessary to route out hammond every hamas.

certainly that has been its perspective, and although it will be difficult to enforce this, there does add to a growing sense of pressure and isolation on israel, there have been many countries expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza and specifically about the situation in rafah as well which the united states warned against this offensive, although we heard a couple of days ago that the U.S. said no red lines had been crossed there so far. But it does certainly -- verdicts like this, judgments like the icj's judgment today do add to that pressure and help shape the international response, for example, in russia when the icj ruled that its invasion of ukraine was unlawful, that certainly added some legal weight to many countries giving weapons to ukraine. So that is the kind of picture we are expecting going forward there. Could be stronger responses from western countries as this situation in gaza continues. >> We already had, as you and I were talking about, the three countries, spain, ireland and norway going ahead to declare that they will declare an official palestinian state as of next week. Again, as part of this international pressure and growing international condemnation. Julia, thank you. I will let you go for now. Julia chapman going to continue watching the story out of our bureau in london. And as we return to the scenes outside, we do see a small group of pro-palestinian demonstrators. We would expect reaction to come to this judgment from the international court of justice. What we've seen previously is the lawyers for south africa will respond and also the legal team for israel as well. But julia raises a number of questions, what will come of all of this? Will there be suddenly today or increasingly international condemnation? Will any countries go to the point of new sanctions and will there be, as some have been concerned about from the israeli perspective, will this then lead the united nations security council to declare some new form of declaration which would then require the united states to use its veto power in support of israel in all of this? There are many diplomatic and political repercussions to come even if there is no power to enforce this decision just out from the international court of justice.

The icj has ordered israel to keep the rafah border crossing open, to allow investigators access to the gaza territory, and to report back on the measures israel has taken in one month's time. This is all in response to a request from south africa for a cease-fire, the court's ruling is legally binding, but the icj cannot enforce it and israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. >> Outrage over the war in gaza continues to spark strong reaction and protest in this country. A pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto's main campus has just over six hours left to respond to the school's latest bid to end the demonstration. Meagan fitzpatrick is on campus today. >> The university publicly released the offer that has been presented to students at around :30 yesterday. So it outlines the proposed responses to the protesters' demands. When it comes to the students' demands around u of t divesting from companies that support the israeli military, that's one of the demands of the students, not to have any university money invested in those kinds of companies, the university is proposing to set up an advisory committee to do a review of the university's investments, essentially and that advisory committee would be made up of students and staff and faculty and alumni and they are saying representatives from the encampment can suggest membership on that committee and that committee would be asked to report back to the president by no later than the end of october. Also on the students' demand for more disclosure around the university's investments, the school is proposing to set up a working group to look at that, looking at ways of increasing transparency around investments, and that group would be asked to report back by mid july. On the protesters' demand around u of t cutting academic ties with some israeli institutions, the university on that point is essentially saying that's a no go, that the university rejects that demand, saying they will not terminate any partnerships with israeli universities or engage in any academic boycotts. They say they will continue to look at ways of increasing opportunities for palestinian scholars here at the university of toronto. So those are sort of the bare bones of some of the offer that the school is presenting to the protesters. In terms of the timing & this offer now, here's a bit of what the u of. It's president merrick gardener said about that. >> It's also clear that many members of our community feel increasing distress by the presence of the encampment. They feel unsafe, they have reported feelings of -- and experience of discrimination and harassment, we have also had reports of hateful speech and hateful acts which we have reported promptly to toronto police service. After hearing these complaints of our community and after recognizing how long the use of this space has been denied to other members of our community, we felt now is the time to act.

>>> My apologies, that's merrick gertner, not garden temple in he said the offer presented to the student is conditional on them clearing the encampment, not setting it up anywhere else on campus and letting convocation ceremonies proceed uninterrupted. That first convocation ceremony set to be held on june 3rd, right over there. And the president saying those ceremonies will go ahead regardless of whether the students accept this offer. >> That is meagan fitzpatrick on campus at u of t this morning. >> There is breaking news just now from canadian border and customs officers, that they could go on strike as early as next month. In a release just out this morning, their union says workers with cbsa, canada border service agency have voted the 6% in favour of job action. Now, there's no strike date yet, but their union expects to be in an illegal strike position in early june. 90% of border officers are considered essential can't can't walk off the job but it could cause delays for travellers at border crossing as and at airports of course right at the time of the busy holiday season.

Also ordering israel to keep the rafah border crossing open for basic supplies for humanitarian aid, to allow investigators access to the territory in gaza to investigate what is at the basis of the south african allegation of genocide, and report back on all measures israel has taken in a month. Those are the four key points from the decision you saw live on cbc morning live, this is all in request for south africa's request for a cease-fire. The ruling is legally binding, the icj cannot enforce it. Israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. Now, we're looking here at live pictures outside the building known as the peace palace, this is the icj, the international court of justice, and we do expect to see as we've seen in past moments on this case lawyers from both sides on the steps of the courthouse responding to the icj decision. We will have that for you live just as soon as we see. As far as reaction, we are just

hearing through reuters from, palestinian authority, here is the statement from the palestinian authority, welcoming the icj decision and saying it represents, quote, an international consensus to end israel's war on gaza. That again from the palestinian presidency, a spokesperson to the reuters news agency. And we will continue to bring you reaction, there is just some reaction and now again to reuters from israel's finance minister, saying that after this ruling, those who demand that israel stop the war are demanding that it should decide to cease to exist, israel will not agree to that. That gives you a sense of the kind of reaction we will see from both sides to come. So we will watch that story very closely through the day here on cbc news network, and just before we go, let's touch base one more time with chris murphy and our forecast heading into the weekend, race weekend in ottawa, all sorts of activities outdoors, all across the country, chris, have a good one. >> Thank you, you too, heather, yeah, big travel weekend in the states, memorial day weekend and again from the upper midwest right down to the southern plains, severe weather there. We've got rain on the north side of our low pressure system. This is the biggest weather maker for today, certainly, in southern manitoba, where we could be looking at more than 50 millimeters worth of rain by the time it ends tomorrow. This is a slow-moving system and locally heavy bands of rain and it's a cold rain, 4° in brandon, 10 in winnipeg, and you will be lucky if you see 10 and we could be getting into wet snow towards riding and turtle and duck mountain, those kind of parts, a little higher elevation. Over towards southern alberta and southern british columbia, another day where we can get some more showers and thunderstorms. Medicine hat has had 110 millimeters of rain so far in may. That is more than double what you would normally get. We could get more thunderstorms there. So there's your heavy rain and wet snow lifting northward, so by tomorrow afternoon, that rain is winding down in the south. More scattered showers and likely thunderstorms into the bc interior and for the south coast, you've got some scattered showers, for the next few days and below seasonal values as well. So the west is getting some beneficial rain, although when you start talking about 50-plus millimeters, we're talking tractors getting stuck in the field. So that's not necessarily good news. But overall, this moisture pattern in the west has been what we needed. Just wish we could get a little bit further north, scattered thunderstorms as mentioned possible, 5 to 15 millimeters of rain for the west coast and this again, portions today, tomorrow, and then there will be more additional rain sunday with those cooler temperatures. Beautiful day in much of the lower great lakes, st. Lawrence river, very warm in the maritimes. Now, keep an eye on your northwest sky because we've got the cold front coming in, so scattered thunderstorms along were it, northwestern new brunswick mid afternoon spreads its way southeastwards through the late afternoon and evening hours, not everybody's going to get a storm, but at this point, we think below severe warning criteria, and there's going to be a chance overnight tonight that southwestern ontario could get a couple of nocturnal storms. That will spread their way eastwards tomorrow, but it's not an all day event saturday. >> The weather update is brought to you by the ""off! Cast"" mosquito forecast.

We begin with breaking news on the israel-hamas war and a ruling just out from the international court of justice in the hague. The judges at the icj had reaffirmed earlier orders in a case brought by south africa, and today they have ordered israel to halt its offensive in rafah. Israel has been ordered to reopen the rafah border crossing to give investigators access and to allow for the flow of aid and humanitarian investors. >> Israel must halt its military actions and any other actions which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza or conditions of life that could bring about the significant destruction. >> A reporter is just outside the court in the hague where that ruling came down. Alex, what can you tell us about the ruling and the potential impact? >> Certainly this ruling we expect would send a clear message and it has done that. The court ordering israel to cease all military operations in rafah. And explaining some of the logic behind that decision. They say the humanitarian situation in rafah can be seen as disastrous, and they are not convinced that israel has put enough in place to cater to that humanitarian support, or to allow for the safe evacuation of civilians. Two fold measures, one, the stopping of all military operations in rafah, and to allow for the axis of the united nations fact-finding mission in rafah as well. Clearly a message from the world court that israel has to do more, must do more, and that things have not approved -- improved since they last ordered israel to do so. Now the bigger question is a bit more complicated. Although these are legally binding orders they are not legally enforceable. The international court of justice says that palestine does not have a police force to enforce these orders. What they can do, or what the un can do is have the security council pass resolutions to sanction israel, force embargoes on israel and have enforcement actions on these orders, but those can be vetoed by the united states. So crucially the relationship between israel and washington dc is not crucial going forward. >> Reporter: as you are speaking, alex -- alex, allegedly hamas has issued a statement, saying that they are urging the security council to implement the icj ruling. Let us move away from the icj for a moment and turn to the icc, where the lead prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant for the israeli prime minister and other top israeli officials, as other -- as well as other members of hamas leadership. Let us talk about the increasing international pressure, presumably, where you are as well, we can hear that screaming, and all the pressure on israel? >> Certainly diplomatic pressure, we have heard spain, ireland and norway saying in a matter of days they will recognize palestinian states. Slovenia and belgium and others should follow suit. But crucially germany and france say the conditions have not been met to recognize palestine as a state, and that remains a big issue. The international criminal court requestinghose arrest warrants , and that decision will be made in a couple of months. That would mean that prime minister netanyahu, defence minister gallant, would not be able to travel to 124 countries around the world, including canada and most of the european union states as well for fear of being arrested. Now also the leadership of hamas , the leaders of hamas who organized the atrocities of october seventh are as well subject to those arrest warrants. But you are right to say that there is a building diplomatic pressure. Perhaps one difference is the new dutch government that will be formed in the next few days, and they seem to be more supportive of israel than the previous one. Globally speaking, more pressure on israel to do more, but there are se excepti >> Natasha: alex caddy eight, at the hague. Thank you. Let us get closer to the actual war. Let us go to gaza, where the israeli army says they have retrieved the bodies of three more hostages killed during the october 7th attack by hamas militants. The military says the recovery was part of a special operation in northern gaza which had seen erce fighting in recent days. Irris makler joins us now from jerusalem. She is tracking not part of the story. What do we know at this stage?

Editorial credit: Wafa

In the early morning of Friday 12 April, an incident occurred in the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Achimeir, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, went missing while tending to a flock of sheep near his family's illegal settlement, the 2015-established ""Malachei Hashalom"". [1]

The disappearance of the boy, which was initially suspected to be a kidnapping, prompted an extensive search involving Israeli authorities, the military, and numerous settlers.

However, it took 24 hours before Achimeir's body was discovered near the ""outpost"", signalling the start of a sequence of events that would lead to a deadly escalation of violence. [2]

WhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""

Israeli authorities state that Achimeir was killed on that particular morning, although it took some time for his body to be found. They inaccurately concluded that he was killed in a ""terror attack"". [1]

Simultaneously, disturbing messages started circulating within settler WhatsApp groups, encouraging retaliatory attacks on neighbouring Palestinian villages.

These messages, originating from individuals with extreme views, promoted activities such as obstructing villages, conducting house-to-house searches, and imposing collective penalties on Palestinians.

One such message, attributed to the terrorist Elisha Yered -- a former spokesman for MP Limor Son Har-Melech and extreme settler suspected in the murder of a Palestinian man last August -- called for ""crowning"" nearby Palestinian villages. [3]

In addition, he urged fellow occupiers to conduct ""home to home searches,"" and impose ""collective punishment against the murderous Arab population."" [3]

This message contained a list of meeting points, some of which were marked with fire emojis, indicating potential targets for violence. [4]

Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destruction

The response to Achimeir's death was immediate and brutal.

In the following days, settlers carried out shooting and arson attacks against Palestinian neighbourhoods. Homes were set ablaze, cars were set on fire, and lives were lost.

According to Palestinian officials and witnesses, the attacks were highly organised and targeted specific individuals and groups near the illegal settler community.

In al-Mughayyir village, which is close to Achimeir's ""outpost"", residents said they were pelted with stones, burned cars, and shot at by armed settlers as they tried to defend their homes. [3]

A BBC report noted that construction worker Abdellatif Abu Aliya's house was stormed by settlers. They damaged his property and killed his cousin, Jihad.

''The settlers cut the electricity to the house and drained the property's water tanks by shooting them.

""Jihad, who had come to defend the house, threw rocks back from the roof towards the settlers. But the settlers returned gunfire, killing Jihad with a shot to the head.'' [3]

In other villages, similar scenes played out, with innocent Palestinian families caught in the middle of settler reprisals.

50-year-old Shehade Abu Rasheed's family suffered attacks on their home. His daughter, Noor, was shot twice in the legs while seeking refuge with her wounded mother. [3]

Another young villager, 17-year-old Yaqoub Nasan, was shot multiple times in the neck while he was unarmed. [3]

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 32 people in al-Mughayyir were wounded by gunfire. By Saturday afternoon, after the body of Achimeir was discovered, two more Palestinians had been killed. In property damage, more than 20 houses and 100 vehicles had been set ablaze. [3]

Zionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active support

In the wake of the violence, lives were lost, houses were destroyed, and entire communities were traumatised.

At the same time, the Israeli regime came under criticism for its failure to prevent the violence and to hold the perpetrators of the attacks accountable. In addition, some of the attacks were unsurprisingly carried out by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). [5]

According to one family's video, armed settlers were seen walking around their property before the attack began. At least two of them were wearing what appear to be IDF uniforms.

Abu Aliya said,

""They worked in groups and were following orders from two men, one in uniform and one not. They covered their faces, then one group came forward to throw rocks and set fire to the cars.

""Another group stood at the edge of the property with pistols. Behind them was a group with M16s who fired at the house from the olive groves."" [3]

The involvement of soldiers in some of the attacks, which were witnessed by the villagers and recorded on video, has added to the complexity of the situation.

But as the dust begins to settle in the wake of these terrible events, it is essential that the voices of the victims must not be silenced.

The Palestinian villagers who have suffered the most from settler violence deserve recognition and assistance as they begin to rebuild their lives after what they have endured.

Similarly, justice and human rights advocates who are fighting for peace and reconciliation must continue to stand up against Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people.

Analysis ANALYSIS Shaheer Choudhury Head of Editorial

Pay attention to the entire Palestinian cause!

Over the past (nearly) eight months, the world has taken a painstaking amount of time to recognise the true situation in the Gaza Strip.

In that time, the Zionist entity has been unleashing untold mayhem upon the Palestinians, with tens of thousands of women and children killed under the pretext of eliminating Hamas.

Arguably, this is one of the most foolish positions that an authoritarian, oppressive, occupying power has ever held in recent history. One cannot simply eradicate the hearts and minds that yearn to resist occupation and that understand defeat is not in the least in the loss of people or property.

Imagine if the situation was reversed

Our role as Muslims in the West must be to continue to speak out about the situation of the whole of Palestine, all of the occupied territories, all of those who we know to be languishing behind bars, and all of those who have gone missing.

Illegal settlers -- such as those who responded with barbarism to the death of one boy -- question why Palestinian resistance fighters are determined to protect their homeland, but they will never see how the situation is many times worse for them.

It is not right that Benjamin Achimeir has been killed -- according to Israeli sources, by a Palestinian hand -- but this level of response is a microcosm of what the Zionist regime has been doing in Gaza.

And this is while vast parts of Palestine are illegally occupied, have been occupied, and more areas are being stolen as we speak. The international community recognises the illegality, and yet barely anything is mentioned about such cases.

I've seen these enormous piles of logs.

""Ukraine has every right to retaliate,"" Lecornu said, adding that ""there is nothing new here in terms of international law.""

According to him, this ""diplomatic permission"" is simply an application of the law.

""A country that has been attacked can retaliate against centers of military aggression in another territory,"" Lecornu said.

""It is Russia that is changing its way of waging war and in particular by retreating behind its border. So it is Russia that has also carried this risk of seeing its own territory struck. The roles must not be reversed,"" the minister added.

Lecornu also stressed that 'weapons given to Ukraine allow Ukraine to defend itself and this does not make France a co-belligerent power.""

The minister also said he was not aware of the use of French weapons outside of Ukraine at this time.",ukrinform.net,news,Ukrinform-EN,,-0.3019607843137255,454857683,3,https://www.ukrinform.net/img/img_none.jpg,

( ) >> Todd: welcome back to ctv news channel. Things are going fromad to worse for israel. The country is facing new outrage and condemnation after admitting that there were mistaken air strikes on a refugee camp in southern gaza. Now the country's prime minister benjamin netanyahu yes something unfortunately went tragically wrong promising an investigation. We're hearing upwards of 45 people killed including women and children. Ctv's colton praill is in the capital tracking all of this and what will be out rage colton against israel over this. >> Reporter: todd, we're already seeing it from the international community. This is quick to happen today and continuing as the day goes on. The fact we saw israelist prime minister benjamin netanyahu stand up in the country's parliament today and call this a mistake, say something did tragically go wrong here shows the amount of pressure that israel is under. Unprecedented to this point. We have the ruling of the international court of justice on friday specifically calling out concerns continuing with the military operation in rafah over the loss of life and inability to conduct military operations without dramatic civilian loss of life and following that two days later you have this strike happening at an encampment near rafah where the israeli army the idf says their intelligence told them no civilians would be harmed by this, but as you can see in the video here that's on the screen and the data we have from the gaza ministry of health and important to note that is hamas run. They say 45 dead, 250 or so injured. That number could still climb further. It's a very different scenario than the one that the idf says they green lit. So the fact that you do have the israeli prime minister standing up and acknowledging this speaks to not only the challenge of the situation in rafah but the

international pressure he is facing because since this strike, a number of countries have come out quite strongly. Spain has threatened potential sanctions. They said it may be time to consider that as long as the operation in rafah is ongoing and israel continues to ignore the order from the icj, france said they are out raged by this urging israel to follow the orders. We have also seen a number of very high profile people including the high commissioner of the united states come out and not mince words about this saying that not only was this horrific but entirely predictable outcome even going as far as to say there has been no apparent change in the means or methods of warfare that israel is operating within and so with all of that international pressure, we're seeing much more focus on the way that israel operates as compared to what we have seen in the past. We're seeing a much tighter focus on their decision to continue these bombardments questioning whether casualty rates we are seeing justify the military objective. Israel was quick to point out they did kill two senior hamas commanders in this strike. >> Todd: ctv's colton praill in ottawa with the latest. Thank you. We'll keep an eye on it and you will from the capital. >> Reporter: any time. >> Todd: there is a parliamentary committee also going on in ottawa over growing concern of anti-sematic in canada and it will hear from a number of voices and it already heard from some including prominent presidents including concordia president and talking about anti-semitism on campuses and more measures to be taken to try to protect the jewish community. >> Condemns anti-semitism and all forms of racism and discrimination.

And israel's prime minister, benjamin netanyahu and his country under fire once again. Now he is calling it a tragic mistake after an airstrike hit a refugee camp in gaza and the rafah area leading to the deaths of dozens of palestinians. Here's more from netanyahu in a row. >> But a few bump into. Comey will be a saying here that they tried to evacuate upwards of a million civilians out of harm's way. Gaza officials, health officials say the strike killed at least 45 people, including women and children. Israeli military claiming the strike killed 2 senior hamas militants. Netanyahu admitting the operation went wrong despite israel's efforts to protect and evacuate civilians. United states is calling on israel to do more to protect civilians. Says it is now working with the israeli defence force to assess what happened. But you can see tense, literally burning and charred vehicles as well. Here at home, the leader of the ndp, jagmeet singh is calling on the trudeau government to do more to send a message to israel. >> We're seeing at the rafah is horrific. We saw women and children burned alive. Intense. And what we've seen from this government is delay. So we'll be asking questions in question period today. What will it take for the prime minister? What will it take for the liberal government to finally send a clear message to netanyahu that is actions are inexcusable. And that we demand the government take every step possible to prevent a genocide. >> These are some of the aftermath during the day what it looked like and you can see charred cars and tense reduced to ashes. It acted comes just 2 days after the international court of justice or icj ordered israel to end its military offensive into rafah. Israel, of course, has not and in all likelihood will not comply with that order, which is unenforceable. There are still tens of thousands of people in that part of rafah, even though that area was designated a so-called safe zone after being pressed by the ndp in question period today about this story. Our foreign affairs minister, melanie joly stood up and called once again for and immediate cease-fire. >> Women and children were burned alive. Intense. They were told they were in a safe zone in a refugee in cabinet, yet they were burned alive. What will it take for this liberal government to send a message to netanyahu that what has happened is inexcusable. >> The killing of innocent civilians is completely unacceptable. And the decisions of the international court of justice are binding the level of human suffering is catastrophic. And that's why mister speaker, we need an immediate cease-fire. >> Meantime, back in our country and 8:00am deadline has now come and gone about 3 hours checking the clock here for demonstrators at a pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto to clear out protest organizers say they plan to hold their ground. It's part of an effort, they say, to force the university to meet their demands. >> We do owe this to community that all fell at a rally with us earlier this morning, where we had hundreds of workers come out or fell. Of course, that represents over a million workers. 54 unions, it shows admin to the people are on our side. We have another meeting scheduled with administration at 5:00pm. And we're hoping to continue negotiation with them at that time. >> Well, here's the thing. Some critics say the university of toronto a caused this by enabling the protesters to stay. They have been there for almost a month now. And a member of the university's chose a different strategy in alberta, for example, university of calgary moved in quite quickly. Toronto decided different approach to be more conciliatory. What started out as a few tense soon grow too upwards of 100 tents. And now it is a stalemate. So how's it all going to play out? Let's bring in ctv's cristina tenalia, she's in our national newsroom following it all for us. They are trespassing. The school is now asking the courts to intervene as well. Christina. Yeah, so tight. Apparently, this group has always been trespassing. According to the university of toronto, while they recognize as an institution and of >> Really as canadians that the right for people of this country to have peaceful

assembly and free expression in the form of protest. They acknowledge their property, despite what some people may believe they say is private property and that, well, they may authorize the use of their property like king's college circle to various groups from time to time and encampment. So an encampment, a gathering of that kind on the university of toronto property that is considered trespassing, that something the university of toronto made clear earlier this month. They say it a second the date they're using as to as to when this encampment popped up is still essentially they have allowed this encampment to remain on the university of toronto property for a club for about a month now under what they say is trespassing. Last night, the university of toronto provided trespassing notices to the protesters actually was in the 4 o'clock hour eastern time and the deadline was 8 eastern this morning. Well, the deadline came and went, as you've noted throughout the day, todd and the protesters remain to here's what's next. What you're looking at on your screen. Here's the university of toronto is noting that they are seeking an injunction in court. Essentially what that means is it that they go to court and and if if granted, if it's successful, it's telling the protesters you have to cease and desist. You got to leave or you will be in contempt of court. The protesters for their part are standing their ground. So they did not leave by the 8:00am eastern time deadline this morning. Also last week on thursday university, the university of toronto president provided a very thorough offer to protesters in terms of what the university was willing to do and how the university was willing to move forward in this, in this process, the protesters for their part, they say not good enough. They presented their own very thorough counter counter offer. Yesterday, the 2 sides are scheduled to meet at some point today. But we're, we're here at an impasse. Here's more from one of the spokespeople for for the palestinian supporters as part of the might of all of this, despite all the horrors and atrocities we're seeing every single day last 234 days. >> U of t continues to tell us they cannot make commitments. And that we must go through a bureaucratic committees committees that will lead us nowhere. But we do not have time for committees. We do not have time to wait. So the university of toronto, their position at this time is there are, of course, willing to have. >> Open communication with the protesters and and for that to continue, but they're moving forward with this court injunction. Todd, we know we have seen this across the country. It's a process that pretty speedy, but could still take a few days in terms of having a hearing, so that we anticipate that they'll be some kind of hearing on this matter the that the injunction application will go before a judge at some point in the next few days. And again, in the meantime, the university in the protesters will meet at some point today. But as we've seen from the group, as we've heard from the pro-palestinian protesters who have gathered for the last month at the university of toronto. They're not satisfied with the offers made by the university. And there is no indication that they're going to leave at any point soon. I mean, they may be compelled by the court, but it may has. One spokesperson for the palestinian group told us earlier today they're concerned it could get ugly. They say, and that they may be forced out by police. Back to you, ctv's chris tension alley and our national newsroom. Thank you, christina. For that. >> Meantime, we know that certain labour groups have come out in support of these protesters at the university of toronto. Let's bring in fred hahn. He's the president of ontario's division for the canadian union of public employees or cupe fred, good to see you as always. Thanks for taking tell us why the union showed up today. >> Well, what protesters are doing at the university of trying to is deeply connected to watch labour unions rely on occupying space. You it's what a picket line is. It's had one of the fundamental tools the labour movement has been able to use to defend workers rights and to make employers have to pay attention what the encampment is doing at the university of toronto is making the administration have to pay attention for many years. Students and activists at that campus have been calling on the administration to stop investing resources. In instruments of war and torture. And so I think, you this is the last ditch attempt during very desperate times to have this administration finally pay attention. It is very much like the last ditch attempt that workers that make when they go on strike and from a picket line and it is by the labour movement must and will defend this kind of action. Hey, fred, when you hear that the u of t is now saying that they're trespassing and this could end up with police moving in. Your thoughts on on that. >> We just completed a very

We do have some wet weather in store at times today, all due to this disturbance that's sliding into eastern ontario. And this morning some showers, even an isolated thunderstorm. And you can see that that's pushed in. We'll see a bit of a lull. And then another wave will move in this afternoon. In total 20 to 40mm possible by by the end of today into tomorrow. So, this will be some soaking rains at times. And you can see winds currently out of the east. They will turn to a southwest wind and going to be a little breezy at times, likely 30 to 40km, 30 to 50km/h throughout the day. Today we're starting off pretty mild. We should still be in the high single digits as an overnight low. Nowhere near that. We're more towards the mid teens and we'll get into the low 20s as a daytime high today with the humidex, though, it will feel closer to the high 20s. So here's a look at what we can expect.

Here's a look at your national and international headlines. The death toll from severe weather in the southern united states has now risen to 18. Powerful storms left a wide trail of destruction across texas, oklahoma and arkansas. The worst damage was seen in a region spanning from north of dallas to the northwest corner of arkansas. The governor of kentucky declared a state of emergency early this morning, citing multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes. Now, forecasters say the greatest risk for weather will shift to the east today, with severe storms expected anywhere from alabama as far as new york city. Strong winds and heavy rain pounded the coastal regions of bangladesh and india as a severe cyclone made landfall. Millions of people are without electricity after a power poles fell and trees were uprooted by gusty winds. Dozens of bangladeshi villages were flooded after a flood protection. Embankments either washed away or were damaged by the storm surge. Nearly 800,000 people had been evacuated from vulnerable areas in bangladesh on sunday. The india meteorological department says the storm is likely to weaken further throughout the day, but warns heavy showers will remain over the next two days. 12 people were injured by severe turbulence on a qatar airways flight from doha to dublin. It happened while flying over turkey. The plane, a boeing 787 dreamliner, still managed to land safely as scheduled, but passengers on board say the turbulence lasted less than 20s and occurred during food and drink service. This incident follows similarly severe turbulence on a singapore airlines flight nearly a week ago, where dozens of passengers were injured and a man died of a suspected heart attack. Former us president donald trump is looking to gain more support along the campaign trail this weekend. He took to swing state north carolina, where he was met with waves and cheers. But he had a rockier reception at the libertarian national convention after getting booed and heckled

during a raucous speech. Astrid martinez has more on what lies ahead for trump and president joe biden. This week, as summer kicks off the presidential race is also heating up in north carolina this weekend, nascar fans cheered ahead of former president trump's arrival at the coca-cola 600 race. >> It's trump's third visit to the swing state this election. >> It's going to be a great race. >> But his reception was far less friendly while on the campaign trail in dc on saturday. >> I will be a true friend to libertarians in the white house. >> Trump was booed by the crowd at the libertarian national convention after asking for the third party's endorsement. President biden did not attend the libertarian convention, instead delivering the commencement address at west point graduation and using the moment to take a jab at former president trump. >> And your very first day at west point, you raised your right hand and took an oath not to a political party, not to a president, but to the constitution of the united states of america. >> President biden will also head to a swing state this week. Pennsylvania it will be his seventh time in the state this year. Astrid martinez, cbs news the remains of an unknown newfoundland soldier who died in france during the first world war arrived home in saint john's . >> France transferred the remains to canada over the weekend during a repatriation ceremony at the beaumont-hamel newfoundland memorial. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the national war memorial in downtown saint john's. This is where the unknown soldier's remains will be placed in a black granite tomb on newfoundland's memorial day on july 1st. A graphic artist who designed tragically hip themed canadian travel posters has caught the attention of the band. As jay-durant explains, these posters are now being sold across the country. >> A little background music for inspiration. Graphic artist john bell island, his creative partner adam rogers came up with a unique idea to showcase their client mitchell presses capabilities. It'd be kind of cool to do travel posters that were based on the tragically hip songs. Drawing from a classic canadian style, the finished products posted on social media quickly caught the attention of the kingston band, and they got a call from the tragically hip and said, wow, I don't even know about this project. Really interesting. Maybe we can talk about it now. The complete set is being sold on the hips website. On their 40th anniversary, a hip trip around canada incorporating some hidden nuggets from those well-known lyrics. This weathervane jesus. At the top of this, we have ry cooder up in here, singing his eulogy could have been the willie nelson, or it could have been the wine. I probably went through their whole catalog. We actually ended up hiring a writer to help us with that, because we really wanted it to have like a over the top sort of advertising feel to the writing. This is not bilal's first tragically hip themed work. He created a commemorative poster for rogers arena during the farewell tour in 2016, back when he was more of a casual fan. I probably had 2 to 3 albums and now I probably, you know, I listen to them all the time, shaking now that I got my hands steady. John's also an instructor at the wilson school of design from this project that's quickly taken off. There's a lesson here that he will continue to share with his students. You're going to get overwhelmed by the software and the technology and all of those things. But at the end of the day, it's all about imagination. And it will be the one thing that will keep you in the industry. Jay-durant ""global news"" >> And that's what's making national and international news.

Andrew looks as though the encampment still very much there before but behind you rather, they have about till 8:00am tomorrow morning. But a lot happening between now and them. >> A lot happening, although the question is lindsay, will that change anything because ultimately as things stand right now, the people that have been in this encampment going on. 25 days hit nearly hitting 3, 3, a, I should say, hitting almost 4 weeks really that by this point, they have no plans on leaving. As things stand, even after 8:00am, they're not expecting to be wheeled out of here by police. At 8:00 on monday morning. They're expecting first of all that there, there will a court injunction that will be filed. That's happening, we know tomorrow morning. According to only the demonstrators. But what the university of toronto says its trespass notice, which is on the fence behind me that you notice of trespass. Now after that, potentially there could some form of removal in the days to come. That's what the expectation is, at least the plans are for the demonstrators here. But as you can see, looking at bird's eye view of the encampment shot

today. One thing that's really has seemingly changes where the proposals are at the proposal from the university was said was turned down by that from protesters earlier on. I should say it just before the weekend started and they've offered counter proposals today. Here's some of what they're saying that they want. And also a little bit more from what they wanted to share with the media ahead of their meeting at 5:00pm today. >> Ut has filed for an injunction ab to call the police to come at U.S. encampment. And that injunction being filed at 8:00am tomorrow morning in court. And that process will take a couple days. So we actually don't anticipate police showing up at 8:00am tomorrow.

And this injunction with the court. And they've got the process of hiring a very expensive, very notorious law firm to do their bidding for them. And so it will probably take a couple days and we'll have to wait and see what the injunctions s. >> In the interest of transparency in correcting the record. We feel it's important to publicize are negotiating process. Offer. We're given by the administration on thursday. It's more for restatement of university policy that is an actual offer. Most of what was outlined in the document are processes that could have been initiated by students before the encampment. The force being to administration. The same processes that we know time and again and then failure because president gertler has the authority to simply say no to the recommendation of a committee that he stacks himself. >> Now as for the prospect in court with facing this injunction, one thing those 2 protesters who at the at the front of the, the meeting for the, the press conference earlier saying is they feel that they have good chances looking at what happened, for instance, at mcgill university in montreal, where there was 2 injunctions that were filed against the encampment. There. Both the both actually fall off failing in corsi encampment sticking around, even after both of those went through the legal process.

As of august first, 450 licensed grocery stores will be allowed to sell coolers in cases of beer. Let's bring in retail expert bruce wender. Bruce, thank you for being here is always. The ontario premier says it is a promise being fulfilled. But what is your take on this rollout? Mag yes, I think it will be good overall. It is sort of taking a chip away at the monopoly or quasi- monopoly that the beers tour. And I do think it offers a lot more convenience. And also help small business. It helps bring traffic into a lot of these variety stores and maybe other groceries. So I do think overall it is a positive move. >> Renée: there is some criticism on the someone of them is about lcb obeying the exclusive wholesaler of alcohol to grocery stores and convenient stores, would you make of that? >> That is sort of it is what it is. Dale cbo's been around for decades, if not a hundred years and they continued to do that, it does show some type of measured approach do this through regulating it through one entity. But the beer side has opened up a lot more in the l cbo has a few problems right now as it relates to getting spirits this summer. But it is what it is. It is sort of a migration towards a democratized alcohol system. >> Renée: now one of the other major concerns of the reimbursement of the beer store of up to $225 million.

But it sounds like part of that is tuesday tried to sort of keep some beer stores open when the volume goes away, because quite a few canadians, I think six or 7000 people in ontario work at the beer store. I think the government is trying to sort of transition those jobs. And in addition, they are using the beers for the primary distribution or redistribution for empties and returns. So do think they are trying to transition this away from the beers for but still leave them with enough so that they can continue operating and helping out where possible. >> Renée: while accessible be easier for the consumer, is there any other benefits that

show it to you? >> The big benefit will be for the convenience store the smaller grocery, this will help bring people into your stores. And that to me is the big plus here.

There is questions, there will be some shifting jobs to your point, I think eventually from the beer store, can they maintain the same staff that they have not now? Probably not down the road. And the lcb domain need less people as well, but hopefully there will be some more jobs created at some of the local groceries and convenient stores to offset that. >> Renée: all right, that's our time, bruce wender, retail expert think through thinking we appreciate your time you think you have immune. >> Renée: as the summer season rounds the corner into view, some drive-in movie theatres are coming back to life.

They say they were called around 12 30 this afternoon about a woman who was stabbed by a man who is known to her while security was able to detain the suspect. Paramedics have since taken the woman hospital. They say her injuries are serious. And pro-palestinian demonstrators at the university of toronto cabbage will be meeting with school officials later today. For more negotiations. This as a deadline approaches for them to remove their camp. Cp24's andrew brennan joins us live with the latest standard. >> Well, phil, that deadline is a and tomorrow and one thing is based on how the university says it's going to be handling conceivably that demonstrators that are here in their tents, dozens upon dozens behind me here at king's college circle. What the university has said is that they will be filing an injunction in the morning at in the courts. And with that expectation, the demonstrators here say they have, they have no indication that there thinking are going to be any police officers kicking them off of campus and removing them and their tents tomorrow. They say that they will be steadfastly staying here, not just until they are, I told potentially forced potentially to leave, but that they wants to stay until their demands are met. And they shared some of those renewed demands with that. Fry with reporters today outside of simcoe hall just beside where we're standing right now. And those demands updated since the offer they got from the university, giving them this ultimatum of 8:00am on monday. It's take it or leave it, get out situation. The essential crux doubt it comes down to essentially changing between what the university is offering as in some cases, working groups or committees to look at some of the demands instead of support pointing towards the university's president and saying that he can unilaterally do a lot of the changes that they're asking for and removing the committee has something in the middle of their demands for boycotting. For instance, israeli institutions and those that they say would be a b tied to the war in gaza or looking at any divestments from universal for many israeli companies, that potentially could be part of the war or sanctions. They're

out. So that is essential changes that they've offered in their counterproposal. They'll be presenting that to the university administration later on today. As you mentioned, feel at 5:00pm. That meeting will take place. And then to 15 hours after that is when this deadline hits for them too. Leave without potential consequences. But they say they plan to stay. They also have a legal team that will be presenting their case in court as this injunction goes before a judge just for the university seeking that injunction.

Cp24's andrew brennan joins us now with all the latest. What are you hearing from protesters there? Andrew? >> Well, melissa, what will we will be hearing is a counter proposal from demonstrators and we'll have that for our viewers later on into the afternoon. The other thing that we've been hearing from protesters at this encampment who have been here now for 3 and a half weeks. 24 days since made a second is the proposal offered by the administration in given out by the president in a press conference at the end of the week was ultimately not much different, not much to add versus what they have offered. The demonstrators that have been out here for 3 and a half weeks before includes having a working guide advisory committee be set a potentially to look at any forms of

divestments. But that is something that the university ultimately says it has no plans to do. It does say it's open to potentially looking at disclosure, but there will be no boycott. When you look at the trifecta of and this goes back to about 2004, 2005. Just as gaza became more of an enclave at that time, there was a movement called bds boycott, divest and sanction. And that's I tactic used by pro-palestinian. Either demonstrators are palestinians themselves for about 20 years now. Now there is no plan according to the university, in their latest statement to look at any boycotts end of partnerships with israeli institutions. Academic or otherwise. We're starting to hear some of the loudspeakers coming out from this encampment that what the demonstrators have renamed king from king's college circle in to us. They circle for a free hollis 9 now, as I mentioned, they will be sharing some of their counter proposals and demands that they will be bringing to the table at 5:00pm with the administration. Also a press conference has been called for 11:30am tomorrow, which is following the deadline that was set by the administration and is on the notice of trespass on the front gates right behind me that just says says they want to see all of the demonstrators out by 8:00am conceivably indicating that the people that are here. Have no plans to leave despite the threat of legal proceedings. Now when it comes to potential injunction that could be filed against these demonstrators as a tactic that has been used before by other universities. And notably in the case of mcgill university, where there were 2 injunctions filed against the demonstrators there at that encampment. Both of those failed in recent weeks. Now, melissa will send it back to you and have more from the demonstrators and their demands. Coming up later on in the show. Yeah, the hours ahead will be consequential for this encampment at u of t andrew brennan will be bringing us more throughout the day. Thanks for that.

I'm melissa duggan. Durham police are investigating a fatal overnight crash. The collision happened just after 4:00am in the glen, born in grand view area police say the victim is female, but haven't released any further information about her age or identity. The circumstances of the crash still not clear. Police are investigating after shots were fired downtown overnight. Police say a gunshot was heard in the hallway of a condo near richmond.

Pro-palestinian demonstrators at the u of t encampment will be meeting with school officials later today. For more negotiations. This as a deadline approaches for them to remove their camp. Cp24's andrew brennan joins us now with all the latest. What are you hearing from protesters there? Andrew? >> Well, melissa, what will we will be hearing is a counter

proposal from demonstrators and we'll have that for our viewers later on into the afternoon. The other thing that we've been hearing from protesters at this encampment who have been here now for 3 and a half weeks. 24 days since made a second is the proposal offered by the administration in given out by the president in a press conference at the end of the week was ultimately not much different, not much to add versus what they have offered. The demonstrators that have been out here for 3 and a half weeks before includes having a working guide advisory committee be set a potentially to look at any forms of divestments. But that is something that the university ultimately says it has no plans to do. It does say it's open to potentially looking at disclosure, but there will be no boycott. When you look at the trifecta of and this goes back to about 2004, 2005. Just as gaza became more of an enclave at that time, there was a movement called bds boycott, divest and sanction. And that's I tactic used by pro-palestinian. Either demonstrators are palestinians themselves for about 20 years now. Now there is no plan according to the university, in their latest statement to look at any boycotts end of partnerships with israeli institutions. Academic or otherwise. We're starting to hear some of the loudspeakers coming out from this encampment that what the demonstrators have renamed king from king's college circle in to us. They circle for a free hollis 9 now, as I mentioned, they will be sharing some of their counter proposals and demands that they will be bringing to the table at 5:00pm with the administration. Also a press conference has been called for 11:30am tomorrow, which is following the deadline that was set by the administration and is on the notice of trespass on the front gates right behind me that just says says they want to see all of the demonstrators out by 8:00am conceivably indicating that the people that are here. Have no plans to leave despite the threat of legal proceedings. Now when it comes to potential injunction that could be filed against these demonstrators as a tactic that has been used before by other universities. And notably in the case of mcgill university, where there were 2 injunctions filed against the demonstrators there at that encampment. Both of those failed in recent weeks. Now, melissa will send it back to you and have more from the demonstrators and their demands. Coming up later on in the show. Yeah, the hours ahead will be consequential for this encampment at u of t andrew brennan will be bringing us more throughout the day. Thanks for that. Andrew. >> Looking overseas, rocket sirens were heard across central israel, including in tel aviv today.

So many people thought I couldn't do it. They doubted me. I felt like I like, ripped my whole heart out. I didn't realize how formative 25 to 30 would be. I have to kind of repress my own self doubt. You're one of my favourite interviewers, so, I was pumped. Get out of here. Announcer: Q with Tom Power. Available now onCBC Listen or wherever you get your podcasts. [GPS locator beeping] Okay, right this way. [Suzuki] Dr. Lana Ciarniello and field assistant Taylor Greene track a mortality signal from the GPS collar worn by Raven, one of the rewilded grizzly triplets that recently emerged from hibernation. [Ciarniello] There's more there. Like, look at all this hair. There's the hair there, there's the hair there. There's clumps of it everywhere. There, there. [Suzuki] They have come across a trail of bear fur. [Ciarniello] Let's follow it. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... [exhales] There's a dead bear right there, I see it. Yeah, I see it, it's a dead bear. [Suzuki] The condition of her remains makes it clear... [Ciarniello] She's been hammered by another bear. [Suzuki] ...that Raven was likely predated on by an adult bear. [Ciarniello] Bears eat each other, and one of the things that's typical of bear kill is that they invert the hide. They peel back-- it's like peeling open a banana. The hide is actually turned inside out. That is typical bear. Well, Raven, you fed someone. [camera shutter clicks] I was really happy for these bears. They passed the first level of success, but you know, if they die, then that's data, too. And so... when I found Raven, like, I didn't feel sad. I'm sorry, I sorta felt, like, um, okay... this was her fate. I'm really happy that we were able to find out her fate. It's information that we can now use to put to a better cause. Like, the study is on survival and what we think happened... ...and I think we have pieced this together as absolutely best we can. I think we're done. [Suzuki] Now there's one more collar to locate. It's right down here. [Suzuki] Just before Arthur hibernated, his collar broke apart... Yeah, it rotted off. [Suzuki] ...and recently, Isa's collar has stopped transmitting. I'm getting absolutely nothing from Isa. [Suzuki] There's now no remote means for Lana to track Isa and Arthur, the last two surviving bears in her grizzly-rewilding study. Where we're at is confusing right now. Are we going to try to somehow recollar them and get them back online, or are we going to let 'em go? It just looked like a chunk of log until its head lifted. [Marriott] My goal coming here is trying to see if Arthur or Isa are still surviving. That's really key to knowing if this rehab has continued to be successful. If we're lucky enough to spot either Arthur or Isa, I will just be thrilled to see them doing something wild. You know, eating sedge grass, grabbing some barnacles or some mussels, anything like that, just some natural behaviour. I just want to lay eyes on them, and be able to go, ""Oh, my gosh! I saw them!"" [Suzuki] When grizzlies move into to the estuaries in the spring, it's a prime time for boat-based bear-viewing. [Marriott] We've been going 10, 15 kilometres back and forth and back and forth... No sign of Arthur, Isa. [Marriott] ...scanning all these different estuaries and sedge flats. [Suzuki] Because spring has just passed, John may have come a little too late. Hey, bear! [Marriott] We came out here hoping that the bears were still going to be eating sedge grass in the estuary. Hey, bear! [Marriott] We found fresh salmon berries all along the river and in the forest. Well, that's not good. Salmon berries are totally ripe, so that means that the bears are probably going to be in here eating salmon berries instead of out in the estuary where we can see them eating sedge grass. That's not good for our chances. I'm not going to lie. It's a long shot that we're even going to find these bears. [Suzuki] At dawn the next day, John heads out on one last search. [Marriott] We headed towards the first estuary, took a look... ...and there was nothing, and then sort of just slumped down and was sort of half paying attention. [whispers] Oh, my gosh, is that him? Okay, he's up on the grass.

Ah, he's running away from us. Dang. You know, I'm pretty sure its Arthur just from colour alone, like, he's such a distinct-looking bear. Oh, oh, I just saw him again, there. [whispering] There he is up on the log. Oh, look at that. [camera shutter clicking] Okay, I can clearly see his ear tag. Arthur looked amazing. Beautiful size, he had a bit of plumpness to him. He's obviously doing a good job of being a bear. He just picked up a dead bird of some kind. [Marriott] As we came in closer, there were a couple times where he looked out at us, and we were still pretty far away, you know, 250 metres, and he would look out, and he'd watch us for a little while. [camera shutter clicking] He's so occupied. Let's see if we can creep in just a bit more. As we crept in a bit closer where he slowly just decided, you know what, I have had enough of you humans, and he immediately turned and started walking away. He then started to run, just like a wild bear would, and to me, that was a really great sign to see that he is acting exactly like a bear should be acting. [Angelika] When I saw the photo of Arthur, I literally screamed with joy. My husband came running, and was all concerned what had happened. It was such a good feeling to see him there, and looking good, having gained weight from the last time that we saw him. Seeing Arthur after this length of time, it's a big step in the program, and gives it more weight to be considered by others. [Griujs] Let's move her over. Can you grab her hand? [Suzuki] The rewilding team prepare to release the next batch of yearlings, building on the lessons learned from Muwin, Cedar, Raven, Isa, and Arthur. [Angelika] Oh, I think the study is hugely helpful. Not only has it given us some strong data, but it also gives us, in the scientific community, a footprint that others can work on and go forward from. Long-term survival is still the one that we don't know about, and that we still have to work on. [Ciarniello] It would be really nice to have long-term data, that's what the project was set up to get. So, I would love to be able to re-collar Arthur and Isa so that we can monitor them until their end survival point. I know it seems heartless and a bit emotionless, but I really just want to get to the truth of whether rewilding works or not. Then, we can look at how to tweak it and make it better, or we can look at the fact that, okay, we're doing this because, as humans, it makes us feel good. [Griujs] After two years of this rewilding project, we're still learning with every bear we put out there, and even the ones that don't make it, it will only give us more motivation to do better next time, and see what we can do to make them more successful out there. [Angelika] The incident with Muwin last year that cost her life was very upsetting to all of us, and we immediately set about to find different ways of releasing the bears safely. [Suzuki] The yearlings are now tranquilized just once at the shelter, then transported fully awake in newly-designed crates. These can be slung directly to the release site, then remotely opened. [door mechanism whirring] [Angelika] They're right there, bright and alert, and ready to go out into the world. We still know that these bears face numerous challenges out there. We still know that some of them, or a percentage of them, will not make it out there... ...but it's an incredible feeling to set a healthy animal free... ...and giving them that chance.

At least they get this chance. Without the program, they wouldn't have it at all. Great. Top-notch. [ ] [tense] That same woman from the SCC keeps calling, can I give her your number? No! [knocks on door] Michael Lazaridis, want to come and answer some questions? Why is the SCC looking at us?

I think it's pretty cool. >> I had no idea this was happening.

I actually have an uncle who died in world war I and I'm buried in france. >> Deana: and in the war in ukraine, ukrainians are dealing with a russian guided missile strike in a crowded hardware store. Ukrainian officials say two russian guided bombs hit the store, killing two people and injuring dozens more. Several more people were injured in a missile strike in a residential area. Ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky called it another demonstration of russian madness. Zelensky offered his sympathies to the victims' families and says ukraine needs help from western leaders to beef up air defence systems which has been the target of russian attacks for weeks. Russian officials say there was also an attack by ukraine inside their borders. >> There's a lot of attacks that are going to take place physically and diplomatecally. >> Reporter: there's a summit next month in switzerland that russia will not be present. >> Both sides are positioning themselves into a better negotiating position, if you will. >> Reporter: the international conference in june is set to be in sweden, but russia's --

russia says any talks without ukraine present is a waste of time. >> Deana: word of a new diplomatic push in the israel war with hamas began to leak out when prime minister benjamin netanyahu said his government would defy a court order and press on with the war in gaza. Now with fighting in its 34 week, pressure is growing on the netanyahu government domestically. This was the scene in tel aviv as many people, including family members of those in captivity, say new negotiations need to take place. >> Reporter: what we've seen the last few hours is there were these meetings in paris between the C.I.A. chief, the israeli mossad chief, and the qatari prime minister. Next week, there's going to be talks between the same parties and egypt, and then hamas will be brought in. It's significant also because of the i.c.j., the international court of justice of israel to stop fighting and particularly -- particularly in gaza. The health ministry in gaza, hamas run, they say there's been dozens more deaths of palestinians, so if there were to be talks and if there was another way to solve this issue, it would be very welcome. >> Deana: journalist irris mackler in jerusalem.

>>> Students at the university of toronto in pro-palestinian encampments have been issued a warning to leave by monday at 5:00 p.m., but students say they are going to stick around. >> U.F.T. knows how to bargain. They bargain with unions on campus all the time. The first win offer cannot be the final offer, so we're preparing orur counteroffer so hopefully we'll be able to present that at the next meeting on sunday. >> Deana: protesters that don't leave by 5:00 P.M. on monday could face consequences, including a five-year suspension and expulsion. >>> Meanwhile, some pro-palestinian university encampments are coming to an end. On saturday, students in hamilton packed up after reaching a deal with McMASTER university. >> This morning, we are disbanding the camp and pack up. >> Reporter: this university student didn't want to reveal his full name out of fear for being retaliated against for those who aren't in favour of the encampment. >> If they weren't willing to hear us out or if we weren't willing to negotiate, none of this would have happened. >> Reporter: McMASTER has made several concessions, including inviting students to a meeting about its investment strategy and annual disclosure of all investments. >> We're going to make sure we hold the university responsible to stay responsible for the demands they committed to. >> Deana: in graduation ceremonies, valedictorian speeches are part of the ceremony, but one speech garnered viral reaction on-line. Remarks by a university of manitoba med school graduate are at the heart of this story. Dr. Gem newman urged graduates to speak out on the israel-hamas war as well as the actions of israel in gaza. Those condemning the remarks were earnest rady, the donor of the largest donation in the university's history. He called the speech ""hate and lies."" . Newman responded by saying it's ironic that demanding a ceasefire and calling for the rights of humans is considered hateful. >> Universities have faced major cutbacks from the public sector over the last couple of decades and are increasingly reliant on these things, and that's why they're taking this position. I think it's not particularly controversial to call for a ceasefire, and the donor has the right to withdraw that contribution. The problem is there's a power imbalance here and that the university really requires the funding, and so the honour gets more priority in this conversation. >> Deana: toronto police are looking for two suspects after finding evidence of gunfire at a jewish elementary school. The investigation began after a report of a bullet in the window for the jewish school for girls. Just after 5:00 a.m., two occupants in a vehicle pulled up and fired a gun towards it. >> The integrated task force is

the lead investigator on this, however, we have the support of the hate crimes unit, as well. One of the questions that people are asking is, is this a hate crime or is this a terrorist act? What I'm going to say is it's too early to saw that. We're not going to ignore this and what the target of the shooting was, but at the same time, it would be premature to react to that at this point. >> Deana: the prime minister has put out a statement, calling this a despicable act of cowardice. >>> Microgroups and their supporters protested saturday in montreal. They're demanding a faster pace by the federal government on its commitment to regularize the status of undocumented workers. >> Reporter: outside justin trudeau's riding office, community groups gathered, criticizing the federal government's work to regularize the status of undocumented workers. >> We want to stay here. >> Reporter: the federal liberals pledged in 2021 to explore ways of regularizing status of undocumented workers, but that study is on going. In the meantime, they say, immigrants are suffering. >> They work below minimum wage, sometimes working 50, 60, 70 hours a week. Sometimes they face even not being paid. [speaking Spanish language] >> Reporter: in a statement sent to cbc news, immigrations, refugees can't refugees canada says it's looking at the situation. >> On the behest of, like, a faucet, when we need more healthcare workers when we need more construction workers, when they need, but actually, on the basis of human values and solidarity. >> Reporter: canada's immigration marc miller has said that he's on track to present a proposal from his-- to his fellow cabinet members next month. >> Deana: a town in northeastern saskatchewan has declared a state of emergency and people there are unable to leave.

And that is probably the place, climate change, I know it doesn't sound sexy, like talking about Bill 21 and Bill 96. But what's missing from the sovereigntist support is the younger generation of Québecers. >> Rosemary: Very quick last word, Andrew. >> Just on the immigration thing, let's supposing we get 100 million people by the end of the 20th century, which is-- the 21st century, which is the great fear that's been raised about this. And let's supposing that Québec's share, that falls to 18%. And let's supposing two thirds of those are French speakers. So it's maybe the worst case scenario you can imagine. That still means you got 12 million French speakers in Québec versus 8 million today. So this notion that Québec is about to be drowned by this deluge of immigrants, or it's going to lose all its clout in the Federation, it had 29% of the population after World War II, it was much less important in the Federation, much less powerful than it is today with 22%. It's not a simple function of your share of the population. >> Rosemary: Okay, I gotta leave it there. We have to take a short break here.

This is the third time issues have been raised with the process of choosing a candidate. Allegations have centered around the party playing favourites. Is this an issue for the Conservatives? Or is the process just like this for all political parties? Let's bring back our panelists, Chantal, Andrew, and Althia. I don't know who wants to go first here, Althia, maybe you. I mean, to some extent this is normal in that parties usually do have a favourite and sometimes they put their thumb on the scale to get the candidate, the nominee that they want for the candidate. What's interesting here is that I don't think people are being really honest about what's happening in terms of who's putting the thumb on the scale, but give me your assessment of what you think is happening and whether it's a problem or not. >> There were many similar allegations in the lead up to the 2015 election when the Liberals were trying to fill in their slate, and they had the star candidates that they wanted to save winnable ridings for. I think on the Conservative side, there has always been this feeling among the membership that the party is really run by the grassroots and that there are rules that are set up and that the party will abide by the rules. And I think what is making a lot of waves is because the rules are not or appear not to have been followed. And the party is not incentivized to tell people why this is going. And they also want to keep people selling memberships because they want those memberships to turn into donors and keep the party growing. So there's disenchantment on that side. Political parties are a key part of our democracy, but they are run as private clubs despite the fact that they get $70 million in campaign election expenses refunded by the taxpayer, that they get about $25 million, maybe a slight little bit more in terms of tax credit support, annually every year. And yet they you know, if there's a privacy breach of our information that the party holds, they don't really need to tell anybody about it. So there are, there are many problems with the way political parties organized their options, their contests. There are several options to fix it, but none of the political parties want to hand this over to Elections Canada or a third party or give any of their power away. And that's why I think it's unlikely that we see any reform. >> Rosemary: Chantal, we've talked about nominations before, what I think the difference here is these are people who want to be candidates that are being told no, you're off the table, even though they had sold memberships, for instance. >> They're not only being told that they're off the table, they're being told that they're disqualified for obscure reasons that are not provided to them, which is a shabby way to treat people who actually are your own supporters, and who want to join your team. But I totally believe that political leaders should be able to pick some or many members of their team, that it's incumbent for a party that wants to run a government to present the best possible team that he or she can assemble. But I also believe that they should be accountable for wanting to do that by doing it up front. Jean Chrétien got from the Liberal membership the power to appoint candidates, and he did use it. And he didn't apologize for it. And you can say whatever you want about grassroots and local democracy, it still made more sense. And it was a cleaner process them to make believe that you are actually doing the grassroots process, and then finding ways to throw out the people that you don't want once they've worked hard to try to become candidates. >> Rosemary: Yeah, and that's the part that's damaging for the Conservatives, Andrew, both Althia and Chantal have identified it there. It's that they, they are a party of the grassroots. They give them a lot of attention during conventions to come up with policy. And then if these kinds of things happen, it sort of blows up in their face a little bit. >> Well, I'm all for transparency. But I also don't actually believe that the leader should choose the M.P.s. I think the M.P. should choose the leader. We were talking earlier about how insignificant M.P.s have become, how insignificant Parliament has become as the representative of the people, a not insignificant matter. Well, the founding point of that, the starting point of that is the way in which we nominate, the way that which we choose the candidates. If we want to start fixing parliament and making Parliament a relevant place again, we got to start looking at the nomination races and if that weren't urgent before, the stuff that we've learned coming out of the foreign interference inquiry,

it makes it absolutely imperative because now it's not just a local thugs fixing races, it's foreign thugs. >> Rosemary: I'm Rosemary Barton. Thank you for watching.

I actually have an uncle who died in world war I and I'm buried in france. >> Deana: and in the war in ukraine, ukrainians are dealing with a russian guided missile strike in a crowded hardware store. Ukrainian officials say two russian guided bombs hit the store, killing two people and injuring dozens more. Several more people were injured in a missile strike in a residential area. Ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky called it another demonstration of russian madness. Zelensky offered his sympathies to the victims' families and says ukraine needs help from western leaders to beef up air defence systems which has been the target of russian attacks for weeks. Russian officials say there was also an attack by ukraine inside their borders. >> There's a lot of attacks that are going to take place physically and diplomatecally. >> Reporter: there's a summit next month in switzerland that russia will not be present. >> Both sides are positioning themselves into a better negotiating position, if you will. >> Reporter: the international conference in june is set to be in sweden, but russia's --

russia says any talks without ukraine present is a waste of time. >> Deana: word of a new diplomatic push in the israel war with hamas began to leak out when prime minister benjamin netanyahu said his government would defy a court order and press on with the war in gaza. Now with fighting in its 34 week, pressure is growing on the netanyahu government domestically. This was the scene in tel aviv as many people, including family members of those in captivity, say new negotiations need to take place. >> Reporter: what we've seen the last few hours is there were these meetings in paris between the C.I.A. chief, the israeli mossad chief, and the qatari prime minister. Next week, there's going to be talks between the same parties and egypt, and then hamas will be brought in. It's significant also because of the i.c.j., the international court of justice of israel to stop fighting and particularly -- particularly in gaza. The health ministry in gaza, hamas run, they say there's been dozens more deaths of palestinians, so if there were to be talks and if there was another way to solve this issue, it would be very welcome. >> Deana: journalist irris mackler in jerusalem.

On saturday, students in hamilton packed up after reaching a deal with McMASTER university. >> This morning, we are disbanding the camp and pack up. >> Reporter: this university student didn't want to reveal his full name out of fear for being retaliated against for those who aren't in favour of the encampment. >> If they weren't willing to hear us out or if we weren't willing to negotiate, none of this would have happened. >> Reporter: McMASTER has made several concessions, including inviting students to a meeting about its investment strategy and annual disclosure of all investments. >> We're going to make sure we hold the university responsible to stay responsible for the demands they committed to. >> Deana: in graduation ceremonies, valedictorian speeches are part of the ceremony, but one speech garnered viral reaction on-line. Remarks by a university of manitoba med school graduate are at the heart of this story. Dr. Gem newman urged graduates to speak out on the israel-hamas war as well as the actions of israel in gaza. Those condemning the remarks were earnest rady, the donor of the largest donation in the university's history. He called the speech ""hate and lies."" . Newman responded by saying it's ironic that demanding a ceasefire and calling for the rights of humans is considered hateful. >> Universities have faced major cutbacks from the public sector over the last couple of decades and are increasingly reliant on these things, and that's why they're taking this position. I think it's not particularly controversial to call for a ceasefire, and the donor has the right to withdraw that contribution. The problem is there's a power imbalance here and that the university really requires the funding, and so the honour gets more priority in this conversation. >> Deana: toronto police are looking for two suspects after finding evidence of gunfire at a jewish elementary school. The investigation began after a report of a bullet in the window for the jewish school for girls. Just after 5:00 a.m., two occupants in a vehicle pulled up and fired a gun towards it. >> The integrated task force is

the lead investigator on this, however, we have the support of the hate crimes unit, as well. One of the questions that people are asking is, is this a hate crime or is this a terrorist act? What I'm going to say is it's too early to saw that. We're not going to ignore this and what the target of the shooting was, but at the same time, it would be premature to react to that at this point. >> Deana: the prime minister has put out a statement, calling this a despicable act of cowardice. >>> Microgroups and their supporters protested saturday in montreal.

In the meantime, they say, immigrants are suffering. >> They work below minimum wage, sometimes working 50, 60, 70 hours a week. Sometimes they face even not being paid.

Their deceit and denial going back decades has created the conditions that persist here today. [Susan] The oil companies reject the lawsuit, Chevron saying climate change is global, calling for a ""policy response, not piecemeal litigation benefitting attorneys and politicians."" -The resolution is adopted.-[cheering] [Susan]In Oregon,a county lawsuit blames the fossil fuel industry for thoseheat dome deaths. With this action,we seek to hold these fossil fuel companiesaccountable for the damagesthat have arisen from one of the mostdeadly and destructive human-made weather disastersin American history. You've taken millions! -Millions of dollars! -[people shouting] And you're killing us! [Susan] And youth are emboldened in this US election year. Go home to Mommy. Your mommy is waiting. Go home to Mommy. Thank you. [Susan] In Canada, young citizens seem to be leading the charge, in public and in court... suing the federal government for breaching its climate obligations and taking on Ontario over its climate plan. We have not come here to beg politicians for change. We have come here to show them that change is coming. [cheering] [Susan] Sophia Mathur was 12 years old when she and a group of kids launched that lawsuit, accusing the government of weakening its climate targets, risking people's health and lives. [photographer] Open up those eyes a little more for me. [Susan] Sophia is four years older now. So is that lawsuit. Beautiful. Chin down a bit. Well, it's been a phrase that I've been saying, but, uh, when all else fails, sue. Uh, we felt like when activism and going out and protesting, it kind of feels like we're talking to politicians and they can choose not to listen. [Susan] Today's task-- a publicity shoot, part of a campaign to capture attention and grow funding. Last year, a judge agreed with parts of their argument. Climate change will have a disproportionate impact on youth and indigenous people, but dismissed the case. What chance do you think, or why do you think it could have success at the appeals stage? Regardless if it has, like, a final win, there's a lot of people that are paying attention to this and realizing that their government is not paying attention to their future. [Susan] Today is their hearing in Ontario's Court of Appeal. [Sophia chuckles] We're walking to court! I am, like, nervous and excited at the same time [Madison] I feel like I'll just keep going. [laughs] Yeah, as long as it takes. [Susan] Madison Dyck, is focused on the endgame. [laughing] I think I just feel-- I feel really emotional. Yeah, I feel emotional that-- that I need to be in this position. And I really also hope that... the next generation doesn't have to stand on these courts, fighting for their future. [cheering] [Susan] Their case may fail on appeal, but across North America, dozens of climate lawsuits are ongoing against governments and corporations. Well, so, here in Victoria, I've been to three demonstrations, walking around with my-- Tracey and I, and the placard sign. [Susan] And in British Columbia, one woman won't stop either. Do you think in your lifetime, it will make a difference? I hope so. Yeah, I think so. [Susan]Jane Armstrongis living in Victoria now, carrying on with a campaignin honour of her sister, who diedin that heat dome. ...and obviously we miss her. But then the messageI put on the back, when I was making this,is, like, ""What is the message?"" The message is, like,fossil fuel dependency plus denial plus delay equals disasters and deaths. At least that's what came out of my head when I was making this poster. I don't know, I kind of like to bring her out into public and say, ""This was my sister and she died and it mattered. And we need to do things differently or more Traceys will die."" [Susan] Meanwhile, 2023 was declared officially the hottest year on record. Scientists say 2024 is tracking to be the same... or hotter. [somber music plays] [Steven] Next week on The Fifth Estate. Parrots are incredible animals. [Parrot] Another overdue bill! Yeah.

Ticketing is such a dark art, and it is so hard to understand. There's so many potential places for it to become corrupt that it's hard to know what the solution is or if this break up would actually make the difference because what are the things that people complain about the most? Exorbitant prices on the secondary market, the fact that ticketmaster essentially went offline when all the taylor swift tickets went on sale. They did recommendlymington remedy that, to their credit, but there are almost no specific solutions for this. In the lawsuit, they're just saying break it up and that will solve the problem.

It might be a benefit in some cases, or might be a hindrance in other cases. [Charlsie]Cold plunging after lifting weights can slow muscle recovery, reducing gains.

[Charlsie] Can cold plunging help with depression or anxiety? There are some indications, yes, that it can. But I think there's more work that needs to be done.

[Charlsie]Blondin also says ""Cold plunging can be unsafe."" This is so much [bleep] harder than it looks. We've heard of instances where people are doing cold water swimming and have drowned. It's not-- They haven't drowned because they can't swim. They drown from this strong cold shock response of this big gasp and this hyperventilation. [Charlsie]Cold plunges can put you into fight... or flight mode. It's why so many feel energized after a dip. But the cold water can also slow your heart rate and your body down. If you have any known or unknown heart issues, experts say you should not do it. If you cold plunge for longer, there's a risk you might become hypothermic, which you might not even realize. Blondin says ""One thing is clear, cold plunging is not a slam dunk, and more science is needed."" It really depends on the type of cold you're doing, how frequently you're doing it, how long you're doing it, so you can't kind of lump them all together. So, if you still want to give cold plunging a go, you're going to want to check with your doctor first. Ask if there's a family history of any cardiovascular issues. If the doctor gives you the all-clear, remember, don't go cold plunging alone. And keep it short. Asha:This season... What was the first indication that you'd been scammed?

[ ] >> It is time for fans and artists to stop paying the price for live nation's... >> Akshay: you are watching ctv news channel pick the U.S. justice department wants live nation and ticketmaster to face the music in a new lawsuit. >>> They... >> Akshay: in some great news, it's official canada has its first wnba team set to play in 2026 hello and welcome to ctv news channel, thank you for joining us. It's a lawsuit that could shake up thanks in the realm of live events paired the U.S. justice department is suing ticketmaster and it's parent company live nation accusing them of running an illegal monopoly. >> Reporter: call it the taylor swift effect, if it worked for the ticket meltdown in 2022 leaving customers fuming over botched ticket sales, perhaps the U.S. government never would've investigated. Two years later the U.S. justice department is now suing the company that owns ticketmaster, accusing live nation of illegally abusing its monopoly power and leaving fans frustrated. >> We allege that live nation has illegally month -- monopolized markets in the united states for far too long. It is time to break it up. >> Reporter: it won't be easy. Live nation is a ticketing giant with a lock on artists and music generals and an endless list of these. >> Ticketing fees, service fees, convenience fees. >> Reporter: that translates into higher prices for fans. >> Toronto prices are insane. >> Reporter: she and her flight -- friends flew to sweden to see her idol because it was cheaper. >> The ticket for the show in toronto and the nosebleeds was three grand. In sweden we got tickets, floor seats for $500 canadian. >> Reporter: fans and politicians have been calling for a crackdown for years. Congress grilled live nation's president just last year. >> This is all a definition of monopoly. It. >> If you care about the consumer, cap the price. >> Part of this action is to really force the industry to show its cards, shine a light on how they operate. >> Reporter: live nation in the statement push back calling the accusations absurd and nothing more than a pr... And they intend to fight back. >> Akshay: canadian basketball fans have scored a major win. Toronto will be home to a new wnba franchise, the first outside of the U.S. mike walker has more. >> Toronto, welcome to the w. >> Reporter: after much anticipation, it's official. The wnba is coming to toronto. >> This team is canada's team. >> Reporter: they have been awarded the league's 14th franchise. Tenenbaum, was also the chairman and minority owner of maple leaf sports and entertainment came -- paid $150 million U.S. for the team. >> It will pave the pathway for women in this country. They can see that the sport they play as girls -- girls and as women is just as important and worth investing in. >> Reporter: toronto has been on the wnba's radar since the raptors 2019 championship run. Last year the league sold out scotia bank arena for a preseason game is. >> I attended our toronto game and lots of people coming up to me and saying thank you for making my dreams come true by bringing ed game here. That's my new -- that's when I knew... >> Reporter: with occasional plaint -- games played out scotia bank arena and at montréal and vancouver. >> We want to use this team to elevate basketball canada. >> Reporter: she has spent a decade with the raptors serving as vice president of operations and player development named the team's president today. >> Comes along with a lot of it very difficult details to work through that there is no president. It's not easy but it's worth it. >> Reporter: women's sports are gaining momentum, the pwhl inaugural season saw huge success with three canadian teams. The wnba is now tipping off its

28 season. >> It's amazing that now female athletes are being recognized. I feel like so many young girls and athletes can also relate and feel inspired. >> Reporter: a sentiment echoed by two-time canadian olympian... Who also coaches national youth possible teams. >> They are going to have... We have not had not in so long. It is something that you dream of and something... >> Akshay: hackers have made good on their threats to release data they stole from london drugs. The company has refused to pay a 25 million-dollar ransom demand from online criminals. They say the leak includes employee information which they call a distressing situation. The western canada-based chain was forced to close all of their stores last month after the cyber attack. >>> Ottawa plans to it -- expand canadian citizenship rights to children born abroad to. >> The legislation will extend citizenship by descent beyond the first generation in a way that is inclusive enough and holds the value of our citizenship. >> Akshay: it would allow canadians born abroad to pass down citizenship to their children. It is a response to ontario court ruling that struck down the stephen art -- stephen harper era law. >>> The university of toronto made an offer to the income into pro- palestinian protesters. >> Given the duration of the encampment and the growing strain on our community, it's time to bring this encampment to an end. >> Akshay: it includes a review of protesters demands to divest from companies with ties to the israeli government. They have also asked the university cut ties with israeli academic institutions but uft says that is off the table. It would appear the protests will not accept the deal. The group calling it an inadequate and offensive offer that does not meet the demands. >>> A bipartisan letter from 23 U.S. senators is urging canada to meet its 2 percent nato spending commitment. Bill blair reacted to that letter. >> I would talk about the $40 billion in meant -- investment we are making in norad modernization. We've acknowledged that there's more that we need to do. We've clearly indicated in our budget the path to getting that done. >> Akshay: it comes just two months before nato member countries are set to meet in washington.

>>> Let me bring in peter mckay, former defence minister under prime ministers stephen harper. Good evening and thank you for your time. >> Euro welcome, good to see you >> Akshay: what you make of the timing of this letter to justin trudeau? It's a rare letter to a head of state. Your thoughts on this move. >> It is unusual although these rumblings have been going on in the states and in washington for some time now. I think it is clearly a move that is intended to increase the pressure on canada frankly in spite of this most recent budget and the defence update. We are still not on path or on pace to meet a 2 percent nato commitment that was made as recently as last year but has been repeatedly made over years to get there until the end of the decade. That's deeply disappointing and worrying to our allies and it sends the wrong site -- wrong signal to our adversaries... >> Akshay: I will come to that in just a moment but I'm curious how do you think the government or the prime minister should respond to this letter, especially as we know when it comes just about two months before the nato summit in washington. >> He's going to be on the hot seat there along with about 12 other countries that are near the bottom of the list. Let's not forget it was recently expanded to include sweden and finland. Other countries, 18 of 32 are now meeting that 2 percent. Other countries are moving more rapidly in that direction. When mr trudeau arrives in washington, he's going to have to answer better than he did today where he the question to his defence minister who we heard from earlier today and frankly that message just doesn't cut mustard. In fact, we are not going to see any real increase in the defence budget until after the next election which is also deeply disappointing and worry some, particularly from rivers of the armed forces and their family >> Akshay: we know that canada has announced the plan of meeting that 1.7 percent target by the end of the decade it. Clearly the senator -- the senators are not impressed with the target. They are aware of the plan that the country has do you think that canada can actually meet that 2 percent target looking at the deficits at home and the pressure on the economy. Do you think this can be done? >> I think it is achievable and I think it comes down to priorities. We came out of afghanistan in 2013 with our reputation very much intact. We were on the right track, frankly the recession did impact our aspirations but it is really a priority. I would suggest a critical priority given what is happening in the broader world. Our commitment to norad and the protection of north america factors into this. The opening of waters in the arctic. We could make a much more specific commitment and we could get to 2 percent if that was a priority for the government and it is simply not a priority. These senators are not reactionary and I know that they are bipartisan people... As well as others like them following mitt romney. Americans known to canadians, they've been to the security forum. They consider canada their most important ally but they are really disappointed. Now I suspect quite concerned that canada is once again kicking the football down the field and not giving a hard number in terms of how we are going to get to 2 percent. >> Akshay: I'm glad you brought that up because we know these senators are mix of democrats and republicans and they are in good standing... Let me ask you about what's happening with the U.S. as well. How much do you think the presidential election and the possibility of donald trump coming back as the president could be weighing on the minds of the senators. We know where donald trump stands and how pushy he has been on this subject. >> I say he has in fact been very direct in his criticisms. Not just of canada but other countries who he has described as laggards and having sat around nato tables, I know the measure of what you contribute to nato isn't really just numbers.

Good evening and thank you for your time. >> Euro welcome, good to see you >> Akshay: what you make of the timing of this letter to justin trudeau? It's a rare letter to a head of state. Your thoughts on this move. >> It is unusual although these rumblings have been going on in the states and in washington for some time now. I think it is clearly a move that is intended to increase the pressure on canada frankly in spite of this most recent budget and the defence update. We are still not on path or on pace to meet a 2 percent nato commitment that was made as recently as last year but has been repeatedly made over years to get there until the end of the decade. That's deeply disappointing and worrying to our allies and it sends the wrong site -- wrong signal to our adversaries... >> Akshay: I will come to that in just a moment but I'm curious how do you think the government or the prime minister should respond to this letter, especially as we know when it comes just about two months before the nato summit in washington. >> He's going to be on the hot seat there along with about 12 other countries that are near the bottom of the list. Let's not forget it was recently expanded to include sweden and finland. Other countries, 18 of 32 are now meeting that 2 percent. Other countries are moving more rapidly in that direction. When mr trudeau arrives in washington, he's going to have to answer better than he did today where he the question to his defence minister who we heard from earlier today and frankly that message just doesn't cut mustard. In fact, we are not going to see any real increase in the defence budget until after the next election which is also deeply disappointing and worry some, particularly from rivers of the armed forces and their family >> Akshay: we know that canada has announced the plan of meeting that 1.7 percent target by the end of the decade it. Clearly the senator -- the senators are not impressed with the target. They are aware of the plan that the country has do you think that canada can actually meet that 2 percent target looking at the deficits at home and the pressure on the economy. Do you think this can be done? >> I think it is achievable and I think it comes down to priorities. We came out of afghanistan in 2013 with our reputation very much intact. We were on the right track, frankly the recession did impact our aspirations but it is really a priority. I would suggest a critical priority given what is happening in the broader world. Our commitment to norad and the protection of north america factors into this. The opening of waters in the arctic. We could make a much more specific commitment and we could get to 2 percent if that was a priority for the government and it is simply not a priority. These senators are not reactionary and I know that they are bipartisan people... As well as others like them following mitt romney. Americans known to canadians, they've been to the security forum. They consider canada their most important ally but they are really disappointed. Now I suspect quite concerned that canada is once again kicking the football down the field and not giving a hard number in terms of how we are going to get to 2 percent. >> Akshay: I'm glad you brought that up because we know these senators are mix of democrats and republicans and they are in good standing... Let me ask you about what's happening with the U.S. as well. How much do you think the presidential election and the possibility of donald trump coming back as the president could be weighing on the minds of the senators. We know where donald trump stands and how pushy he has been on this subject. >> I say he has in fact been very direct in his criticisms. Not just of canada but other countries who he has described as laggards and having sat around nato tables, I know the measure of what you contribute to nato isn't really just numbers.

it is in terms of what you are doing, where you are doing it, what those capabilities that nato requires really are in terms of equipment and troops and training. But this number has become a significant benchmark when measured against other countries and it has a lot to do with canada's performance competitiveness with respect to our economy as to how we are going to reach that to present. The presidential election, which is going to come on the heels of the washington summit is inevitably going to be a factor in terms of how the americans weigh in on this subject matter of defence. It affects them, they are concerned about the vulnerability of the canadian arctic. We saw a chinese weather balloon drifting across our country. It was the americans who took that balloon down let's not forget. The capability gap that is growing is of major concern to our allies, particularly the americans. >> Akshay: peter mckay, former foreign affairs minister and defence minister of canada.

Editorial credit: Wafa

In the early morning of Friday 12 April, an incident occurred in the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Achimeir, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, went missing while tending to a flock of sheep near his family's illegal settlement, the 2015-established ""Malachei Hashalom"". [1]

ContentsWhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destructionZionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active supportAnalysisAlso read

The disappearance of the boy, which was initially suspected to be a kidnapping, prompted an extensive search involving Israeli authorities, the military, and numerous settlers.

However, it took 24 hours before Achimeir's body was discovered near the ""outpost"", signalling the start of a sequence of events that would lead to a deadly escalation of violence. [2]

WhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""

Israeli authorities state that Achimeir was killed on that particular morning, although it took some time for his body to be found. They inaccurately concluded that he was killed in a ""terror attack"". [1]

Simultaneously, disturbing messages started circulating within settler WhatsApp groups, encouraging retaliatory attacks on neighbouring Palestinian villages.

These messages, originating from individuals with extreme views, promoted activities such as obstructing villages, conducting house-to-house searches, and imposing collective penalties on Palestinians.

One such message, attributed to the terrorist Elisha Yered -- a former spokesman for MP Limor Son Har-Melech and extreme settler suspected in the murder of a Palestinian man last August -- called for ""crowning"" nearby Palestinian villages. [3]

In addition, he urged fellow occupiers to conduct ""home to home searches,"" and impose ""collective punishment against the murderous Arab population."" [3]

This message contained a list of meeting points, some of which were marked with fire emojis, indicating potential targets for violence. [4]

Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destruction

The response to Achimeir's death was immediate and brutal.

In the following days, settlers carried out shooting and arson attacks against Palestinian neighbourhoods. Homes were set ablaze, cars were set on fire, and lives were lost.

According to Palestinian officials and witnesses, the attacks were highly organised and targeted specific individuals and groups near the illegal settler community.

In al-Mughayyir village, which is close to Achimeir's ""outpost"", residents said they were pelted with stones, burned cars, and shot at by armed settlers as they tried to defend their homes. [3]

A BBC report noted that construction worker Abdellatif Abu Aliya's house was stormed by settlers. They damaged his property and killed his cousin, Jihad.

''The settlers cut the electricity to the house and drained the property's water tanks by shooting them.

""Jihad, who had come to defend the house, threw rocks back from the roof towards the settlers. But the settlers returned gunfire, killing Jihad with a shot to the head.'' [3]

In other villages, similar scenes played out, with innocent Palestinian families caught in the middle of settler reprisals.

50-year-old Shehade Abu Rasheed's family suffered attacks on their home. His daughter, Noor, was shot twice in the legs while seeking refuge with her wounded mother. [3]

Another young villager, 17-year-old Yaqoub Nasan, was shot multiple times in the neck while he was unarmed. [3]

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 32 people in al-Mughayyir were wounded by gunfire. By Saturday afternoon, after the body of Achimeir was discovered, two more Palestinians had been killed. In property damage, more than 20 houses and 100 vehicles had been set ablaze. [3]

Zionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active support

In the wake of the violence, lives were lost, houses were destroyed, and entire communities were traumatised.

At the same time, the Israeli regime came under criticism for its failure to prevent the violence and to hold the perpetrators of the attacks accountable. In addition, some of the attacks were unsurprisingly carried out by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). [5]

According to one family's video, armed settlers were seen walking around their property before the attack began. At least two of them were wearing what appear to be IDF uniforms.

Abu Aliya said,

""They worked in groups and were following orders from two men, one in uniform and one not. They covered their faces, then one group came forward to throw rocks and set fire to the cars.

""Another group stood at the edge of the property with pistols. Behind them was a group with M16s who fired at the house from the olive groves."" [3]

The involvement of soldiers in some of the attacks, which were witnessed by the villagers and recorded on video, has added to the complexity of the situation.

But as the dust begins to settle in the wake of these terrible events, it is essential that the voices of the victims must not be silenced.

The Palestinian villagers who have suffered the most from settler violence deserve recognition and assistance as they begin to rebuild their lives after what they have endured.

Similarly, justice and human rights advocates who are fighting for peace and reconciliation must continue to stand up against Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people.

Analysis ANALYSIS Shaheer Choudhury Head of Editorial

Pay attention to the entire Palestinian cause!

Over the past (nearly) eight months, the world has taken a painstaking amount of time to recognise the true situation in the Gaza Strip.

In that time, the Zionist entity has been unleashing untold mayhem upon the Palestinians, with tens of thousands of women and children killed under the pretext of eliminating Hamas.

Arguably, this is one of the most foolish positions that an authoritarian, oppressive, occupying power has ever held in recent history. One cannot simply eradicate the hearts and minds that yearn to resist occupation and that understand defeat is not in the least in the loss of people or property.

Imagine if the situation was reversed

Our role as Muslims in the West must be to continue to speak out about the situation of the whole of Palestine, all of the occupied territories, all of those who we know to be languishing behind bars, and all of those who have gone missing.

Illegal settlers -- such as those who responded with barbarism to the death of one boy -- question why Palestinian resistance fighters are determined to protect their homeland, but they will never see how the situation is many times worse for them.

It is not right that Benjamin Achimeir has been killed -- according to Israeli sources, by a Palestinian hand -- but this level of response is a microcosm of what the Zionist regime has been doing in Gaza.

And this is while vast parts of Palestine are illegally occupied, have been occupied, and more areas are being stolen as we speak. The international community recognises the illegality, and yet barely anything is mentioned about such cases.

Meanwhile, Blue Capsule has signed a partnership agreement with the French Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission, from which it was spun off, for the development of its small modular reactor.

Thorizon - a spin-off from NRG, which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten - is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe molten salt reactor (MSR), targeted at large industrial customers and utilities. Thorizon aims to construct a pilot reactor system before 2035.

MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.

The molten salt fuel adopted by Thorizon uses a combination of long-lived elements from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and thorium. The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.

Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.

Thorizon said it will ""benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers"".

""The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,"" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. ""We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.""

""It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,"" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. ""Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.""

Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that ""can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source"". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.

Decarbonising industry

Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.

Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.

Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.

""France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,"" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. ""And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.

""This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.

""It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.""

Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1372549019607843,454689557,3,,

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 TraxxTM Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Alstom is pleased to invite you to a conference call presenting its full year results for Fiscal Year 2023/24 on Wednesday 8 May at 08:30 am (Paris time), hosted by Henri Poupart-Lafarge, CEO and Bernard Delpit, CFO.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",wallstreet-online.de,news,wallstreet:online,,0.1686274509803922,452842931,5,https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png,eng-9548481

Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1686274509803922,452842765,5,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.at,news,finanzen.at,,0.223529411764706,452842634,5,https://www.finanzen.at/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg,eng-9548481

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.ch,news,finanzen.ch,,0.223529411764706,452842602,5,https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,

Alstom FY 2023/24 Free cash flow at €(557) million following strong €562 million Free cash flow generation in the second half on the back of operational turnaround, and €2 billion deleveraging plan ready to be executed.

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",streetinsider.com,news,StreetInsider.com,,0.1607843137254903,452842387,5,http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,eng-9548481

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ[6] and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

***

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year.

In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia Stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

Traxx™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

***

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

***

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités.

The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 TraxxTM Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

Financial trajectory for FY 2024/25

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Supportive market demand FY 2024/25 downpayments consistent with FY 2023/24Balance sheet deleveraging plan fully executed in FY 2024/25End of integration of Bombardier Transportation in FY 2024/25

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Book to bill above 1Sales organic growth: around 5%aEBIT margin around 6.5 %Free Cash Flow generation within the €300 million to €500 million rangeSeasonality driving:negative FCF in the first half of FY 2024/25 within a range of €(300) million to €(500) million margin development to be more second-half weighted

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",wallstreet-online.de,news,wallstreet:online,,0.1686274509803922,452842931,12,https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png,eng-9548481

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Alstom is pleased to invite you to a conference call presenting its full year results for Fiscal Year 2023/24 on Wednesday 8 May at 08:30 am (Paris time), hosted by Henri Poupart-Lafarge, CEO and Bernard Delpit, CFO.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1686274509803922,452842765,12,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.at,news,finanzen.at,,0.223529411764706,452842634,12,https://www.finanzen.at/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg,eng-9548481

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",streetinsider.com,news,StreetInsider.com,,0.1607843137254903,452842387,12,http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,eng-9548481

In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ[6] and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

***

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia Stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

Traxx™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

***

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Meanwhile, Blue Capsule has signed a partnership agreement with the French Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission, from which it was spun off, for the development of its small modular reactor.

Thorizon - a spin-off from NRG, which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten - is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe molten salt reactor (MSR), targeted at large industrial customers and utilities. Thorizon aims to construct a pilot reactor system before 2035.

MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.

The molten salt fuel adopted by Thorizon uses a combination of long-lived elements from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and thorium. The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.

Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.

Thorizon said it will ""benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers"".

""The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,"" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. ""We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.""

""It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,"" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. ""Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.""

Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that ""can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source"". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.

Decarbonising industry

Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.

Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.

Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.

""France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,"" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. ""And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.

""This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.

""It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.""

Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1372549019607843,454689557,12,,

And we had an earlier statement from the idf saying that these strikes were carried out against legitimate targets under international law for the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence against two senior hamas officials but as you did mention there, reaction coming in from right around the world. We also heard from the U.N. palestinian refugee agency, unwra. It has posted on ""x"" that gaza is now hell on earth adding that they have lost contact with colleagues in the gaza strip. Let's take a listen to what we also heard from the e.u.'s foreign policy. Josef burrell. >> This is a dilemma how the international community can force implementation of the international justice. >> Natasha: there's something else we absolutely need to cover. This airstrike happened just hours after dispursed rocket attacks into central israel in months and the rockets were fired from rafah and hamas has claimed responsibility. That's a major development. Just bring us up to speed on that. >> Reporter: you're exactly right. It's caused a lot of shock here in tel aviv and central israel. It was four months since the last air raid sirens were activated. A barrage of missiles sent over from, as you mentioned there, from rafah into central israel, causing people to run to shelter. We can stel tell you that the iron dome missile defence system was activated and intercepted quite a large number of these rockets, although some did make it through. It was just a little further north of me that one of these rockets actually came and hit a house injuring one person that was then taken to hospital. So certainly this is something that hamas continues to do, fire rockets from rafah, really causing a lot of panic here in israel. >> Natasha: we've got two, three days of just absolutely devastating and destructive rocket fire going back and forth. What is all this doing for any possibility of ceasefires or talks of negotiations, hostage release, anything like that? >> Reporter: well, really it would appear to be diminishing the chances of any hostage and ceasefire talks. We do know that the israeli war cabinet met last night, although they are remaining very, very tight-lipped about what actually was discussed there. We've also heard the qataris coming out saying these strikes on rafah really affect the chances of any ceasefire and hostage deal being reached and while there is a lot of hope this may be achieved, not really a lot of optimism. >> Natasha: sarah coates in tel aviv, thank you.

>>> A jewish girls' school in toronto is welcoming back students today after shots were fired at the building over the weekend. Police say they're looking at multiple suspects and the hate crimes unit has opened up its own investigation. Cbc's marianne dimain is following this ier stochlt earlier today a solidarity rally did take place. The mayor and other officials were there. What can you tell us about that? >> Reporter: the message at this rally outside of the school in toronto this morning is that students should have the right to a safe learning environment and that's why dozens of people came out outside of the jewish girls' school. Some of them carrying flags, other signs. One of them said ""you are not alone."" what you're looking at now, scenes from the weekend and the damage to the school that happened on saturday morning. Police saying that armed suspects were at the school around 5 A.M. that's when shots were fired at the school before the suspects fled the scene. At this point, they have not found those suspects, but no one was injured in this case. The school was damaged, as you saw there in those images. The school community quite shaken up as a result of what happened there over the weekend and that's what prompted today's rally. The mayored was also there but also parents were quite concerned and here's more from one of those parents. >> Who are angry and shocked, angry that we have to explain to our girls why this is happening and shocked that, you know, it's gone this far. >> Reporter: toronto's police chief as well as the mayor of the city was also there this morning. Other communities were also speaking to the crowd of dozens of people standing there in the rain this morning and here's some of what was said. >> What happened here this weekend crossed a dangerous line. It was an attempt to intimidate and isolate the wonderful people, the wonderful children, here and it was a deliberate attempt to spread fear across our entire jewish community, to make us cower and hide who we are. As you can see here today, the attackers completely failed. We are more united than ever. We are more committed than ever to support each other. We are more determined than ever to fight antisemitism wherever it happens. >> We say to this coward, these cowards, we will find you. You will be held responsible. >> Reporter: toronto's guns and gangs unit as well as the hate crime unit are investigating. The suspect has not yet been found. >> Natasha: I want to let folks watching at home know that we have put in a request to speak to toronto mayor olivia chow about what's happened at the school and how things will move forward from there. So thank you for playing that clip, marianne. Let's talk about the school itself. What is it going to look like there today? >> Reporter: you know the school community banding together right now. They are standing together in solidarity. Its business as usual there. The principal spoke at this news conference as well as to reporters saying that there is a lot of attendance there. Not a lot of people have stayed home. They have pretty much a full house. Amid those classes today also a stepped up police presence. That will be the case for quite some time. Also some important conversations. Here's more on that. >> I have two groups of students who are splitting them in half. The younger students first and then the older students. And we are going to have those conversations. We'll discuss what happened. We're going to discuss moving forward, how we plan to continue doing what we're doing. >> Reporter: that stepped up police presence not just at the bais mushka but other area schools and area synagogues in the community as well. >> Natasha: cbc's marianne dimain dimain, thank you so much.

They've been on an evacuation order for more than two weeks when the parker lake wildfire got way too close. They're praying themselves for what they're see when they get back home. >> Out in the rural areas, they're going to see a lot of damage. Particularly out on the edges of community to the north and at the fire bird highway so it's blackened trees and there's some places where you can't go where you used to be able to go like the parker lake recreation area is blocked off just because of so many danger trees across the road. So there is some significant damage to the north and west of the community. You know, that's going to make them feel sad. >> Natasha: more than 4500 evacuees have been out of their homes since may the 10th. Some essential workers have been there over the past few days to get services up and running again. The mayor is telling people to fuel up and bring a few days' of essential supplies. Residents will need to remain on high alert and ready to leave again since they are still fires burning nearby. >>> Prime minister justin trudeau will head to france next week to mark the 80th anniversary of d-day.

At Thunder Bay's favourite festival ""Wake the Giant"". Ta-da! There it is. The premier says the materials in the school were clearly inappropriate. What exactly is the issue? >> Reporter: it's hard to see and vey exactly what the premier is taking issue with, though we know that the premier blaine higgs posted on ""x,"" former twitter, he is furious about this picture, this photo of a presentation that was done at a new brunswick school that was shared with him and is shows questions on this slide where it has questions like, do girls masturbate? Will it hurt the first time I do it? Questions that might come up kind of organically during a sex ed conversation or sex ed class; however, this was being done and organized by the research and information group so acb global action, a group that tries to share information about sexual transmitted infections with students around the world and across canada and specifically this past week in a few schools in new brunswick. And so blaine higgs, the premier of new brunswick, saying that what they were talking about goes beyond the scope of what they were there to speak to the students about. Now, he put this in his post at the bottom of the post, there is a link to the pc party website where people can share their thoughts on if they are concerned about this, how much they are concerned about this, as well as an option to volunteer for the party. So perhaps some public sentiment assessment, perhaps a collection of public feedback happening here as well. >> Natasha: what are we hearing from this organization that offered the sex ed resource? >> Reporter: well, they're scratching their heads a bit too because they've done presentations like this for years in new brunswick schools. They have been prepared in four different new brunswick schools. The material or the topics they will be talking about is all within the curriculum, they say, of new brunswick and the materials specifically was approved, as is always, for them, they say, prior to the presentation beginning by the schools themselves. So they are surprised, disappointed, by this decision. As for more details, the cbc new brunswick colleagues are reaching out to the premier's office so far for more details. So far no answer to those requests. >> Natasha: brett ruskin in halifax, thank you.

>>> Police west of toronto say they have laid hundreds of charges and recovered stolen vehicles worth tens of millions of dollars.

[Lion roar] (Opening Mnemonic) (music throughout) ( ) ( ) [ ] >> Natasha: we expect to hear in the next half hour or so from the governor of kentucky. It's one of four states hit over the weekend by deadly tornadoes. As many as 120 million americans remain under an extreme weather threat. Officials say four children are among the nineteen people killed

across texas, oklahoma, arkansas and kentucky. Hundreds of others have been hurt and at least eleven tornadoes were reported just on sunday. Reporter steve futterman is joining us live from los angeles. Steve, such a terrible loss and loss of life but also the destruction of property, the uprooting of communities. What's the latest from the officials in those four affected states? >> Reporter: you know, natasha, this is a holiday weekend here in the U.S. but there are many people in those four states who are not really celebrating death and destruction in those four states, texas, oklahoma, arkansas and kentucky. Texas, I think, one of the hardest hit areas. You go to some pockets where the tornadoes went through, there's not much left in some of these small towns. Virtually every home has been knocked town, businesses knocked down. We've heard harrowing stories of survival. This man from texas telling how he got through the tornado. >> The owner came around honking his horn warning everybody to get out. I don't know why I heeded that warning. I'm glad I did. I grabbed my dog. We headed for there and it just -- it was just unbelievable the sound of all the destruction going on around us. It's terrible. >> It's terrible. It's amazing the destruction and

the loss that has been experienced in this tornado. Not only here in valleyview but at the other locations here in north texas. >> Reporter: valleyview, texas, you heard that mentioned just before that area, that small town at least seven people died there. And you look everywhere in these places, the trees are down, power lines are down, there are hundreds of thousands of customers without electricity right now. And there are even some reports of some of these big rig trucks, natasha, these giant big rig trucks just blown over by all this. >> Natasha: the weather continues to be a threat. So what are we seeing in the forecast? >> Reporter: well, this storm is not over. It's moving east, though, so kentucky, these other states will not be impacted that much but it's moving east so the east coast is going to be hit. We don't know how severe the weather will be, but there are these severe weather watches throughout and up and down the east coast from new york to savannah, georgia, and we mentioned texas. They may not be having these storms right now but they're having right now very hot weather in del rio, texas, today, temperatures expected to hit 43° celsius. So if it's not a storm, it's the heat. Just really severe weather throughout the U.S. right now. >> Natasha: steve futterman, thank you so much. >> Reporter: thank you. [ ] Let's go for a skate, and a little chat.

Indigo shareholders are voting on a deal that would put the company fully back in the hands of its founder and her husband. Scott peterson is following this story. The big question is why take the company private now? >> Reporter: a lot of analysts are asking this. There's a couple of it different answers. One the stock is flirting with lows that we haven't seen in four years. So it's a potentially good buying opportunity. And two, if you're the majority shareholder, maybe you want to buy those shares back before putting some real investment into the company. There's a couple of different things. Take a look at the stock price and get a sense of what's happening. The share is worth $8. Over $30 if you go back a few years. They're at $2.48, there about, because the offer now is for $2.50 for the shares that heather reisman and jared schwartz do not own. So the ownership structure here is kind of an interesting with indigo. For example, jared schwartz is the founder of onyx corp.

he owns 59% of the common shares of the company through holding companies. He is married to ceo heather reisman, who owns about 4.6 of indigo shares again through holding companies. So together, they make up about two-thirds of the company. Now, the offer for the shares, like I mentioned, at $2.50, and the vote is taking place this morning at 11 o'clock and it requires approval by two-thirds of the shareholders out there and the majority of the shareholders who are not involved with those holding companies. So a lot of analysts are saying that indigo is going through some tough times. They need some money to invest. They've fired people as recently as january and they took a $50 million fiscal loss last year, so the company is poised to have an influx of cash. Maybe we will see that after the restructuring and if it does go through and approved by the board, there will be -- it should delist the company as of june. They expect that to close soon. >> Natasha: the canadian stock market is open for business. It's memorial day down south. What should we be looking for? >> Reporter: look for markets to drive the sideways. We have the tsx up 50 points. Don't expect any volume or volatility without the big direction of U.S. neighbour. Let's take a look at some of the indicators s the price of oil flirting with $78 a barrel. We have the canadian dollar, the euro, british pound, all a little bit positive against its U.S. counterpart. I don't know if we get the tsx. It's up about 60 points right now. That's without direction of the U.S. markets which are closed for memorial day. >> Natasha: thank you, scott. >> Reporter: thanks.

Rescuers are digging with their bare hands or simple tools to reach the victims. Tons of debris buried the homes in the middle of the night when most of the villagers were asleep. Some parts of the village are under as much as 8 metres of debris. Officials warn that few of those will be saved because damaged roads mean rescuers can't get the heavy equipment they need into the disaster zone. Let's stick with this story. Mate begocher is with the united nations humanitarian. He is an adviser there. He's based in papa new guinea and joining us from wabeg. Thank you for making time for us. >> Reporter: thank you. I want to let the audience know, it is so dark where you are because ""a,"" it's the middle of the night, and you guys have lost power. So it really means a lot that you've stayed up to speak to us.

Can you please describe what you saw. >> Yes, thank you for having us. So we reached today the disaster area. We were there where the landslide occurred, approximately 72 hours ago. So there is a population in big disstress. People are very traumatized looking for their relatives who are buried and the overall situation was very, very tense.

So, this will be some soaking rains at times. And you can see winds currently out of the east. They will turn to a southwest wind and going to be a little breezy at times, likely 30 to 40km, 30 to 50km/h throughout the day. Today we're starting off pretty mild. We should still be in the high single digits as an overnight low. Nowhere near that. We're more towards the mid teens and we'll get into the low 20s as a daytime high today with the humidex, though, it will feel closer to the high 20s. So here's a look at what we can expect.

Here's a look at your national and international headlines. The death toll from severe weather in the southern united states has now risen to 18. Powerful storms left a wide trail of destruction across texas, oklahoma and arkansas. The worst damage was seen in a region spanning from north of dallas to the northwest corner of arkansas. The governor of kentucky declared a state of emergency early this morning, citing multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes. Now, forecasters say the greatest risk for weather will shift to the east today, with severe storms expected anywhere from alabama as far as new york city. Strong winds and heavy rain pounded the coastal regions of bangladesh and india as a severe cyclone made landfall. Millions of people are without electricity after a power poles fell and trees were uprooted by gusty winds. Dozens of bangladeshi villages were flooded after a flood protection. Embankments either washed away or were damaged by the storm surge. Nearly 800,000 people had been evacuated from vulnerable areas in bangladesh on sunday. The india meteorological department says the storm is likely to weaken further throughout the day, but warns heavy showers will remain over the next two days. 12 people were injured by severe turbulence on a qatar airways flight from doha to dublin. It happened while flying over turkey. The plane, a boeing 787 dreamliner, still managed to land safely as scheduled, but passengers on board say the turbulence lasted less than 20s and occurred during food and drink service. This incident follows similarly severe turbulence on a singapore airlines flight nearly a week ago, where dozens of passengers were injured and a man died of a suspected heart attack. Former us president donald trump is looking to gain more support along the campaign trail this weekend. He took to swing state north carolina, where he was met with waves and cheers. But he had a rockier reception at the libertarian national convention after getting booed and heckled

during a raucous speech. Astrid martinez has more on what lies ahead for trump and president joe biden. This week, as summer kicks off the presidential race is also heating up in north carolina this weekend, nascar fans cheered ahead of former president trump's arrival at the coca-cola 600 race. >> It's trump's third visit to the swing state this election. >> It's going to be a great race. >> But his reception was far less friendly while on the campaign trail in dc on saturday. >> I will be a true friend to libertarians in the white house. >> Trump was booed by the crowd at the libertarian national convention after asking for the third party's endorsement. President biden did not attend the libertarian convention, instead delivering the commencement address at west point graduation and using the moment to take a jab at former president trump. >> And your very first day at west point, you raised your right hand and took an oath not to a political party, not to a president, but to the constitution of the united states of america. >> President biden will also head to a swing state this week. Pennsylvania it will be his seventh time in the state this year. Astrid martinez, cbs news the remains of an unknown newfoundland soldier who died in france during the first world war arrived home in saint john's . >> France transferred the remains to canada over the weekend during a repatriation ceremony at the beaumont-hamel newfoundland memorial. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the national war memorial in downtown saint john's. This is where the unknown soldier's remains will be placed in a black granite tomb on newfoundland's memorial day on july 1st. A graphic artist who designed tragically hip themed canadian travel posters has caught the attention of the band. As jay-durant explains, these posters are now being sold across the country. >> A little background music for inspiration. Graphic artist john bell island, his creative partner adam rogers came up with a unique idea to showcase their client mitchell presses capabilities. It'd be kind of cool to do travel posters that were based on the tragically hip songs. Drawing from a classic canadian style, the finished products posted on social media quickly caught the attention of the kingston band, and they got a call from the tragically hip and said, wow, I don't even know about this project. Really interesting. Maybe we can talk about it now. The complete set is being sold on the hips website. On their 40th anniversary, a hip trip around canada incorporating some hidden nuggets from those well-known lyrics. This weathervane jesus. At the top of this, we have ry cooder up in here, singing his eulogy could have been the willie nelson, or it could have been the wine. I probably went through their whole catalog. We actually ended up hiring a writer to help us with that, because we really wanted it to have like a over the top sort of advertising feel to the writing. This is not bilal's first tragically hip themed work. He created a commemorative poster for rogers arena during the farewell tour in 2016, back when he was more of a casual fan. I probably had 2 to 3 albums and now I probably, you know, I listen to them all the time, shaking now that I got my hands steady. John's also an instructor at the wilson school of design from this project that's quickly taken off. There's a lesson here that he will continue to share with his students. You're going to get overwhelmed by the software and the technology and all of those things. But at the end of the day, it's all about imagination. And it will be the one thing that will keep you in the industry. Jay-durant ""global news"" >> And that's what's making national and international news.

This ranking, launched by ""Les Echos"" in partnership with Statista, aims to highlight French companies that excel in innovation and best practices.

Gilles David, CEO of ENERTIME, affirms: ""Being in the TOP 5 of Innovation Leaders in France is a great source of pride for all ENERTIME employees, past and present, who have developed over the past fifteen years, a unique proprietary technology in high-power turbomachinery and thermodynamic machines essential for the energy transition. This success is due not only to our teams but also to our shareholders who have supported us and to our clients who took the risk of trusting a young independent SME.""

Innovation Rooted in French Scientific Excellence

ENERTIME's technologies, based on thermodynamics combined with rotating machinery design, exploit a science born in France 200 years ago that is essential to the energy transition. They offer decarbonized and decentralized solutions as an alternative to centralized production solutions.

Tailored Solutions for Industrial Needs

ENERTIME provides customized systems for industrial clients, developing a unique ability to understand and address their issues, which fosters continuous and sustainable innovation.

Strategic Vision Coupled with Innovation

With full ownership of its intellectual property and patents, ENERTIME can deploy its technologies, developed on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, in other fields. These capabilities are a significant asset for developing high-temperature, high-power heat pumps (HTHP). The natural gas expansion turbine installed for GRTgaz in Villiers-le-Bel and the partnership with STOLECT illustrate other successful applications of these technologies.

Inherently Competitive Technologies

A high-power ORC (typically 2 to 3 MW) for waste heat recovery is a very competitive solution with a typical LCOE[1] of €62/MWhe. A high temperature heat pump producing steam, reduces the CO2 emissions of steam production by a factor of ten in France and is 2 to 3 times more efficient than an electric boiler. It also avoids pollutant emissions associated with biomass or RDF[2] combustion. ENERTIME has developed these complex technologies without decarbonization subsidies, which were nonexistent before 2021, and plans to build 10 new machines in two years, in addition to the 12 commissioned between 2012 and 2023.

Strong International Ambition

To become competitive, decarbonization technologies must target a global market. ENERTIME has always aimed to develop relevant international solutions to compensate for a domestic market that take time to open. This strategy has led to successes on three continents and exports to eleven countries. ENERTIME expects most of its revenue to come from exports by 2030. In May 2024, ENERTIME was labeled an Efficient Solution for its ORC modules by the Solar Impulse Foundation and joined this global alliance.

ABOUT ENERTIME

Created in 2008, ENERTIME designs, develops, and implements Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, gaz expansion turbines and high temperature heat pumps for industrial energy efficiency and decentralized production of renewable energy. ORC machines convert heat into electricity. Heat pumps use low-temperature heat to produce high-temperature heat.

ENERTIME is the only player offering ORC machines and a portfolio of technology in the field of thermodynamics for the energy transition. For ORC technology, it is one of the four main global players and the only French one fully mastering this technology of high-power machines (1 MW and more). The Company is qualified as an ""innovative company"" by BPIfrance and is recognized as a French ""Creative Industry"".

ENERGIE CIRCULAIRE, the ESCO subsidiary of ENERTIME is offering the company's technology as a service.

ENERTIME is listed on the Euronext Growth market (ISIN: FR0011915339 - ticker: ALENE).

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 TraxxTM Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

Financial trajectory for FY 2024/25

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Supportive market demand FY 2024/25 downpayments consistent with FY 2023/24Balance sheet deleveraging plan fully executed in FY 2024/25End of integration of Bombardier Transportation in FY 2024/25

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Book to bill above 1Sales organic growth: around 5%aEBIT margin around 6.5 %Free Cash Flow generation within the €300 million to €500 million rangeSeasonality driving:negative FCF in the first half of FY 2024/25 within a range of €(300) million to €(500) million margin development to be more second-half weighted

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités.

The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",wallstreet-online.de,news,wallstreet:online,,0.1686274509803922,452842931,8,https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png,eng-9548481

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1.

Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1686274509803922,452842765,8,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year.

Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.at,news,finanzen.at,,0.223529411764706,452842634,8,https://www.finanzen.at/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg,eng-9548481

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.ch,news,finanzen.ch,,0.223529411764706,452842602,8,https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,

Alstom FY 2023/24 Free cash flow at €(557) million following strong €562 million Free cash flow generation in the second half on the back of operational turnaround, and €2 billion deleveraging plan ready to be executed.

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",streetinsider.com,news,StreetInsider.com,,0.1607843137254903,452842387,8,http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,eng-9548481

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ[6] and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

***

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia Stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

Traxx™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

***

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Editorial credit: Wafa

In the early morning of Friday 12 April, an incident occurred in the occupied West Bank. Benjamin Achimeir, a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, went missing while tending to a flock of sheep near his family's illegal settlement, the 2015-established ""Malachei Hashalom"". [1]

ContentsWhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destructionZionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active supportAnalysisAlso read

The disappearance of the boy, which was initially suspected to be a kidnapping, prompted an extensive search involving Israeli authorities, the military, and numerous settlers.

However, it took 24 hours before Achimeir's body was discovered near the ""outpost"", signalling the start of a sequence of events that would lead to a deadly escalation of violence. [2]

WhatsApp used to co-ordinate ""collective punishment""

Israeli authorities state that Achimeir was killed on that particular morning, although it took some time for his body to be found. They inaccurately concluded that he was killed in a ""terror attack"". [1]

Simultaneously, disturbing messages started circulating within settler WhatsApp groups, encouraging retaliatory attacks on neighbouring Palestinian villages.

These messages, originating from individuals with extreme views, promoted activities such as obstructing villages, conducting house-to-house searches, and imposing collective penalties on Palestinians.

One such message, attributed to the terrorist Elisha Yered -- a former spokesman for MP Limor Son Har-Melech and extreme settler suspected in the murder of a Palestinian man last August -- called for ""crowning"" nearby Palestinian villages. [3]

In addition, he urged fellow occupiers to conduct ""home to home searches,"" and impose ""collective punishment against the murderous Arab population."" [3]

This message contained a list of meeting points, some of which were marked with fire emojis, indicating potential targets for violence. [4]

Achimeir's death taken as basis for mass killings and destruction

The response to Achimeir's death was immediate and brutal.

In the following days, settlers carried out shooting and arson attacks against Palestinian neighbourhoods. Homes were set ablaze, cars were set on fire, and lives were lost.

According to Palestinian officials and witnesses, the attacks were highly organised and targeted specific individuals and groups near the illegal settler community.

In al-Mughayyir village, which is close to Achimeir's ""outpost"", residents said they were pelted with stones, burned cars, and shot at by armed settlers as they tried to defend their homes. [3]

A BBC report noted that construction worker Abdellatif Abu Aliya's house was stormed by settlers. They damaged his property and killed his cousin, Jihad.

''The settlers cut the electricity to the house and drained the property's water tanks by shooting them.

""Jihad, who had come to defend the house, threw rocks back from the roof towards the settlers. But the settlers returned gunfire, killing Jihad with a shot to the head.'' [3]

In other villages, similar scenes played out, with innocent Palestinian families caught in the middle of settler reprisals.

50-year-old Shehade Abu Rasheed's family suffered attacks on their home. His daughter, Noor, was shot twice in the legs while seeking refuge with her wounded mother. [3]

Another young villager, 17-year-old Yaqoub Nasan, was shot multiple times in the neck while he was unarmed. [3]

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 32 people in al-Mughayyir were wounded by gunfire. By Saturday afternoon, after the body of Achimeir was discovered, two more Palestinians had been killed. In property damage, more than 20 houses and 100 vehicles had been set ablaze. [3]

Zionist forces aided settler attacks with protection, intelligence, and active support

In the wake of the violence, lives were lost, houses were destroyed, and entire communities were traumatised.

At the same time, the Israeli regime came under criticism for its failure to prevent the violence and to hold the perpetrators of the attacks accountable. In addition, some of the attacks were unsurprisingly carried out by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). [5]

According to one family's video, armed settlers were seen walking around their property before the attack began. At least two of them were wearing what appear to be IDF uniforms.

Abu Aliya said,

""They worked in groups and were following orders from two men, one in uniform and one not. They covered their faces, then one group came forward to throw rocks and set fire to the cars.

""Another group stood at the edge of the property with pistols. Behind them was a group with M16s who fired at the house from the olive groves."" [3]

The involvement of soldiers in some of the attacks, which were witnessed by the villagers and recorded on video, has added to the complexity of the situation.

But as the dust begins to settle in the wake of these terrible events, it is essential that the voices of the victims must not be silenced.

The Palestinian villagers who have suffered the most from settler violence deserve recognition and assistance as they begin to rebuild their lives after what they have endured.

Similarly, justice and human rights advocates who are fighting for peace and reconciliation must continue to stand up against Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people.

Analysis ANALYSIS Shaheer Choudhury Head of Editorial

Pay attention to the entire Palestinian cause!

Over the past (nearly) eight months, the world has taken a painstaking amount of time to recognise the true situation in the Gaza Strip.

In that time, the Zionist entity has been unleashing untold mayhem upon the Palestinians, with tens of thousands of women and children killed under the pretext of eliminating Hamas.

Arguably, this is one of the most foolish positions that an authoritarian, oppressive, occupying power has ever held in recent history. One cannot simply eradicate the hearts and minds that yearn to resist occupation and that understand defeat is not in the least in the loss of people or property.

Imagine if the situation was reversed

Our role as Muslims in the West must be to continue to speak out about the situation of the whole of Palestine, all of the occupied territories, all of those who we know to be languishing behind bars, and all of those who have gone missing.

Illegal settlers -- such as those who responded with barbarism to the death of one boy -- question why Palestinian resistance fighters are determined to protect their homeland, but they will never see how the situation is many times worse for them.

It is not right that Benjamin Achimeir has been killed -- according to Israeli sources, by a Palestinian hand -- but this level of response is a microcosm of what the Zionist regime has been doing in Gaza.

And this is while vast parts of Palestine are illegally occupied, have been occupied, and more areas are being stolen as we speak. The international community recognises the illegality, and yet barely anything is mentioned about such cases.

So, this will be some soaking rains at times. And you can see winds currently out of the east.

Powerful storms left a wide trail of destruction across texas, oklahoma and arkansas. The worst damage was seen in a region spanning from north of dallas to the northwest corner of arkansas. The governor of kentucky declared a state of emergency early this morning, citing multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes. Now, forecasters say the greatest risk for weather will shift to the east today, with severe storms expected anywhere from alabama as far as new york city. Strong winds and heavy rain pounded the coastal regions of bangladesh and india as a severe cyclone made landfall. Millions of people are without electricity after a power poles fell and trees were uprooted by gusty winds. Dozens of bangladeshi villages were flooded after a flood protection. Embankments either washed away or were damaged by the storm surge. Nearly 800,000 people had been evacuated from vulnerable areas in bangladesh on sunday. The india meteorological department says the storm is likely to weaken further throughout the day, but warns heavy showers will remain over the next two days. 12 people were injured by severe turbulence on a qatar airways flight from doha to dublin. It happened while flying over turkey. The plane, a boeing 787 dreamliner, still managed to land safely as scheduled, but passengers on board say the turbulence lasted less than 20s and occurred during food and drink service. This incident follows similarly severe turbulence on a singapore airlines flight nearly a week ago, where dozens of passengers were injured and a man died of a suspected heart attack. Former us president donald trump is looking to gain more support along the campaign trail this weekend. He took to swing state north carolina, where he was met with waves and cheers.

Graphic artist john bell island, his creative partner adam rogers came up with a unique idea to showcase their client mitchell presses capabilities. It'd be kind of cool to do travel posters that were based on the tragically hip songs. Drawing from a classic canadian style, the finished products posted on social media quickly caught the attention of the kingston band, and they got a call from the tragically hip and said, wow, I don't even know about this project. Really interesting. Maybe we can talk about it now. The complete set is being sold on the hips website. On their 40th anniversary, a hip trip around canada incorporating some hidden nuggets from those well-known lyrics. This weathervane jesus. At the top of this, we have ry cooder up in here, singing his eulogy could have been the willie nelson, or it could have been the wine. I probably went through their whole catalog. We actually ended up hiring a writer to help us with that, because we really wanted it to have like a over the top sort of advertising feel to the writing. This is not bilal's first tragically hip themed work. He created a commemorative poster for rogers arena during the farewell tour in 2016, back when he was more of a casual fan. I probably had 2 to 3 albums and now I probably, you know, I listen to them all the time, shaking now that I got my hands steady. John's also an instructor at the wilson school of design from this project that's quickly taken off. There's a lesson here that he will continue to share with his students.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

Quality of order intake during the second half provides comfort in continuing to grow the margin in backlog: +60bps in FY 2023/24 versus last year, and expected +50bps per year in the coming three yearsIn FY 2023/24, Alstom continued to ramp-up production rates, delivering 4,645 cars, compared to 4,151 in 2022/23Supply chain efficiencies allowed to decrease inventory days since 30 September 2023Costs efficiency programs now launched across overheads and indirect procurement, with notably the aim to reduce SG&A over sales by ca. 1pp over three years vs FY 2022/23.

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

Divestments for ca. €700 million:Sale of TMH for €75 million realized in January 2024The announced sale of conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, which will generate proceeds of ca. €630 million upon closing expected during Summer 2024The issuance of hybrid bonds with 50% equity content for Moody's5 in an amount of ca. €750 million to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approvalA capital increase with preferential subscription rights in an amount of ca. €1 billion to be executed no later than September 2024 subject to market conditions and AMF approval

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ6 and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

repayment of Neu CP by €1,033 million repayment of RCF drawings by €175 million

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

Business update

Growth by offering greater value to customersOrders

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités.

The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia StreamTM High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 TraxxTM Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Sales

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

Divestments

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2.Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

3.Profitability

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

4.Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

€2.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in October 2024;€1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2027;€2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2029.

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5.One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13th consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

Financial trajectory for FY 2024/25

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Supportive market demand FY 2024/25 downpayments consistent with FY 2023/24Balance sheet deleveraging plan fully executed in FY 2024/25End of integration of Bombardier Transportation in FY 2024/25

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Book to bill above 1Sales organic growth: around 5%aEBIT margin around 6.5 %Free Cash Flow generation within the €300 million to €500 million rangeSeasonality driving:negative FCF in the first half of FY 2024/25 within a range of €(300) million to €(500) million margin development to be more second-half weighted

***

Mid to long-term ambitions

The Group's ambition is to deliver around 5% average sales growth over the mid to long term, thanks to a book-to-bill above 1, largely driven by Services, Signalling and Systems product lines. Rolling stock is expected to grow above market rate, Services and Signalling at high-single digit rates and Systems at double digit rates.

On profitability, Alstom's ambition is to consistently deliver an adjusted EBIT margin between 8% and 10% over the mid to long term. This improvement from 5.7% in fiscal year 2023/24 will be driven by:

Continuous improvement of gross margin in backlog thanks to quality order intake and completion of legacy projects.Improved execution through operational excellence initiatives and industrial optimisation.Cost efficiency programs across indirect procurement and overheads.

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

Free Cash Flow:Alstom expects free cash flow conversion to trend towards 100% of adjusted net income over the cycle. Yearly performance is subject to short-term working capital volatility, notably from the phasing of downpayments.Over the next three years, the Group expects to deliver at least €1.5 billion in free cash-flow over FY 2024/25 to FY 2026/27, despite Contract Working Capital being a headwind over that period.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

net restructuring expenses (including rationalization costs)tangibles and intangibles impairmentcapital gains or loss/revaluation on investments disposals or controls changes of an entityany other non-recurring items, such as some costs incurred to realize business combinations and amortization of an asset exclusively valued in the context of business combination, as well as litigation costs that have arisen outside the ordinary course of businessand including the share in net income of the operational equity-accounted investments

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Contract Assets & Liabilities, which includes the Customer Down-PaymentsCurrent provisions, which includes Risks on contracts and Warranties

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Contract Working Capital Income Tax receivables and payablesRestructuring provisions

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control L2 A and Onvia Control L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",wallstreet-online.de,news,wallstreet:online,,0.1686274509803922,452842931,7,https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png,eng-9548481

8 May 2024 - Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, Alstom booked €18.9 billion of orders. Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

2. Innovation by Pioneering Smarter and Greener Mobility for All

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1686274509803922,452842765,7,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is de?ned as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",finanzen.ch,news,finanzen.ch,,0.223529411764706,452842602,7,https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,

Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

Progress on Alstom's action plan to support its financial targets

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

The €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan highlighting commitment to Investment Grade

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités. This new fleet will replace the existing rolling stock on lines 13, 12 and 8 of the Île-de-France metro as of 2027. The Group also signed a framework contract with Akiem European rolling stock leasing company for 100 Traxx Universal multi-system (MS3) locomotives, together with an initial firm order for 65 locomotives. The total amount of the framework agreement is up €500 million.

In Germany, Alstom was awarded a contract to supply 40 Coradia Stream High-Capacity electric multiple units together with full maintenance for 30 years to Nahverkehrsverbund Schleswig-Holstein (NAH.SH), valued at close to €900 million, and including an option for up to 55 additional trains with a corresponding full-service package. The Group also signed a contract with RAILPOOL for 50 Traxx Universal multi-purpose locomotives.

In Romania, Alstom, as part of a consortium with the civil works companies Gulermak and Arcada, also signed a contract with the Cluj-Napoca City Hall in Romania for the construction of the Cluj-Napoca Metro Line 1. Alstom's share of this state-of-the-art turnkey project reaches approximately €400 million.

In Italy, Alstom was awarded a contract for the supply of high-speed trains.

In Americas, Alstom reported €2.0 billion order intake, compared with €2.7 billion over the last fiscal year, driven by a contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the United States to deliver 130 full low floor electric streetcars for Philadelphia, valued at over €667 million and with options to build an additional 30 streetcars. And the Group was awarded a contract by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) in the United States to supply 60 single-level rail coach cars valued at approximately €285 million with options to build an additional 313 cars, as part of CTDOT's coach renewal program for its statewide rail system.

In Asia/Pacific, the order intake stood at €3.2 billion, compared to €3.0 billion for the last fiscal year. In the Philippines, Alstom in consortium with Colas Rail has been awarded by Mitsubishi Corporation a contract to provide an integrated railway system for the extension of the North-South Commuter Railway project (NSCR). Alstom's contract share is worth approximately €1 billion. In Australia, Alstom has been awarded a contract worth around €900 million to maintain the regional rolling stock VLocity and Classic fleets in Victoria, Australia for the next decade.

In Africa/Middle East/Central Asia, the Group reported €2.4 billion order intake, compared with €2.2 billion over the last fiscal year. In Israel, Alstom, a member of the TMT Consortium (TLV Metropolitan Tramway Ltd.) and its partners Electra Ltd. & Dan Public Transportation Ltd., have reached financial closure on the contract, awarded in May 2022, to design, build, maintain, and finance the Tel Aviv Metropolitan LRT Green line by Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd (NTA). Alstom's share is valued at €858 million. In Saudi Arabia, Alstom signed a contract of over €500 million with The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) for AlUla's pioneering battery-powered tramway - the world's longest catenary-free line.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

Services sales stood at €4.3 billion, up 11.9% on a reported basis and 14.3% on an organic basis versus last year, benefiting from the continuous ramp-up in the UK, in Italy and in the US as well as a solid level of execution in Canada.

In Signalling, Alstom reported €2.6 billion sales, up 8.9% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an organic basis versus last year, led by a consistent execution across all regions, mainly in Europe and in APAC.

Systems sales grew 6.9% on a reported basis and 9.3% on an organic basis, and stood at €1.6 billion, driven by a good performance of Turnkey Systems projects in Mexico, Egypt and Canada.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million. Closing of the transaction is only subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to take place as soon as summer 2024. Proceeds for Alstom at closing, net of expected tax and transaction costs, are expected to be around €620 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

TRAXX™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

4. Financial structure

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

5. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

FY 2024/25 Outlook:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Contract and Trade Working Capital

Contract Working Capital is the sum of:

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.",streetinsider.com,news,StreetInsider.com,,0.1607843137254903,452842387,7,http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,eng-9548481

Sales were €17.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1.

The backlog reached €92 billion, providing strong visibility on future sales. Gross margin on backlog reached 17.5% as of 31 March 2024, compared to 16.9% on 31 March 2023.

In the fiscal year 2023/24, Alstom's adjusted EBIT was €997 million, up 17%, equivalent to a 5.7% aEBIT margin, and EBIT before PPA was €356 million. Adjusted net profit was €44 million, net income (group share) was €(309) million, and free cash flow was €(557) million for the full year.

On 31 March 2024, the Group's net debt position stood at €(2,994) million, compared to the €(2,135) million the Group reported on 31 March 2023. Alstom benefits from a solid €6.3 billion liquidity position and equity amounting to €8,778 million on 31 March 2024.

The Board of Directors, in its meeting of 7 May 2024, proposed that no dividend will be paid with regards to the fiscal year 2023/24.

""Alstom recorded a strong rebound during the second half of the year, with solid order intake, strong organic growth, improved profitability and €562 million free cash-flow generation. Thanks to the support of our reference shareholders, we will swiftly execute the €2 billion deleveraging plan, allowing for the stabilization of its Investment Grade rating. In April, we announced the sale of Alstom's conventional signalling business in North America at a favourable valuation, demonstrating the quality and attractiveness of the Group's assets. We are confident in the strength of our backlog and our strategy of selectivity and mix evolution towards services. The Group is capitalizing on the solid operational progress made over the last three years and is launching new initiatives to improve its industrial performance and reduce overheads and indirect procurement costs. Altogether, Alstom is now set on stronger foundations to deliver sustainable profit and cash generation."" said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.

During the second half of fiscal year 2023/24, the Group mobilised around the operational, commercial, and cost efficiency plan:

As announced in November 2023 and reiterated in January 2024, Alstom's Board of Directors is committed to a conservative financial policy and to protect the Group's Investment Grade rating, in particular through a ca. €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan.

This plan and its execution, which have been unanimously approved by Alstom's Board of Directors, has the following components:

The ca. €2.4 billion proceeds correspond to ca. €2 billion of deleveraging, mainly due to the hybrid bond's 50% Moody's debt content.

Each of CDPQ[6] and Bpifrance, holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom's capital, has declared to the Company its intention to subscribe for its pro-rata share of the capital increase.

In addition, Alstom has entered into a standby underwriting commitment with BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale, acting as Joint Global Coordinators, pursuant to which they have undertaken to underwrite the remainder of the capital raise (i.e. ca. €750 million), subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

Circa €1.2 billion of the proceeds of asset disposals and of the capital markets transactions will be used to repay financial debt by September 2024:

The remainder of the proceeds will be invested in highly liquid short-term investment (cash equivalent treatment) and will be earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity.

Alstom Baa3 long-term issuer rating is reaffirmed, and the outlook will be changed to stable upon successful closing of the hybrid bond issuance and the rights issue.

Alstom will terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following the execution of the deleveraging plan.

***

During the fiscal year 2023/24, the Group recorded €18.9 billion in orders, with commercial success across multiple geographies, notably in Europe, Asia/Pacific and in Americas. During the last fiscal year, Alstom reported an order intake of €20.7 billion. The (8)% decrease is mostly driven by last year's landmark contract awarded by Landesanstalt Schienenfahrzeuge Baden Württemberg (SFBW) network in Germany of almost €2.5 billion.

In Europe, Alstom recorded €11.3 billion order intake during the fiscal year 2023/24, compared with €12.8 billion over the last fiscal year.

In the U.K, Alstom has signed an eight-year extension to its Train Services Agreement (TSA) with CrossCountry. The contract extension, valued at around €950 million, further secures this long-term partnership and is evidence of the trust placed by the customer.

In France, Alstom will supply île-de-France Mobilités and RATP with 103 new MF19 trainsets, which is the new generation metro on rail, for a total contract value of more than €800 million, 100% financed by Île-de-France Mobilités.

As of 31 March 2024, the backlog stood at €92 billion, providing the Group with strong visibility over future sales.

Alstom's sales amounted to €17.6 billion for the fiscal year 2023/24, representing a growth of 6.7% on a reported basis and a strong 9.4% on an organic basis compared with Alstom sales in the last fiscal year. Sales related to non-performing backlog, corresponding to sales on legacy projects with a negative margin at completion, amounted to €1.7 billion during the fiscal year 2023/24.

Rolling stock sales reached €9.1 billion, representing an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis, driven by contracts ramp-up in France, Belgium and in the US, and the solid level of execution in South Africa, India and Europe.

On 14 September 2023, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US department of Treasury added JSC Transmashholding (TMH AO) to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person (SDN) List. TMH AO is the Russian holding company of TMH Group and is 100% owned by TMH Limited, and Alstom was holding a 20% stake in TMH limited. The Group further assessed potential exposures arising from the new OFAC sanctions and made the decision to sell its stake in TMH. The transaction was closed early January 2024 for an amount of €75 million, carrying value was nil as result of previous impairment, contributing to the de-risking of the company's portfolio.

On 19 April 2024, Alstom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Knorr-Bremse AG, to sell Alstom's North American conventional signalling business for a purchase price of around €630 million.

As of end of March 2024, research and development gross costs amounted to €749 million, i.e. 4.3% of sales, delivering on the Alstom In Motion strategy which is based on three pillars: Autonomous mobility, Data factory and Mobility orchestration. Net R&D amounts to €549 million before PPA amortisation.

Programs funded by IPCEI Hydrogen are ongoing. This important European program supports the development of new hydrogen trains for regional applications, shunting locos and freight, leveraging on the experience collected with Coradia iLint™ regional trains that are now in revenue service.

Homologation tests of Avelia Horizon™ are planned in 2024 to enable a start of revenue service in 2025. The development of international configurations is ongoing. Alstom has launched the development of Avelia Stream™ 300, addressing the high-speed single deck segment with a first project for Italy.

The replacement of Adessia™ commuter train has been launched to address the U.K. and USA markets. This new product range will include EMU, BMU, BEMU and HMU versions to also replace the existing Diesel trains.

Traxx™ Multi-system 3 - locomotives is pursuing homologation tests in 2024 to enable it to run on the different European corridors. It includes the passenger version which can be operated at 200kph.

Services product line is focused on addressing green, sustainable and more efficient operation concepts. Green re-tractioning initiatives include for example the retrofit with hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines for locomotives and the ability to provide autonomy for non-electrified lines via the so-called ""Last-mile"" functionality supported by the IPCEI H2 program.

Signalling Product Line worked on Onvia Control™ L2 A and Onvia Control™ L2 B European Standard convergence, driving market presence with its integration into TRAXX platform and securing new contracts for cross border operation, Onvia Cab™ level 2 and level 3 on-board solution together with Automatic Train Operation, and it continued its footprint expansion with a new contract in Canada.

Alstom Innovations cluster continued to develop Autonomous Mobility solutions for Passengers & Freight trains. Major milestones on the roadmap to achieve GoA4 (Grade of Automation 4) have been successfully passed under real mainline operating conditions on passengers and freight train with SNCF in France, and for operation in yard in the Netherlands.

Alstom has also made great strides in developing a new SaaS platform that will enhance its global digital offering. The platform streamlines applications integration and deployment in a trusted and future-proof ecosystem.

The adjusted EBIT margin has progressed from 5.2% over the fiscal year 2022/23 to 5.7% over the fiscal year 2023/24, benefiting from further synergies for 30bps, a steady reduction of non-performing legacy contracts sales for an impact of 30bps, an increased volume and favourable mix delivering 20bps gross margin expansion, partially offset by the negative gross margin impact related to the legacy portfolio deviations for (30)bps.

Alstom recorded restructuring and rationalisation charges of €(147) million mainly related to the reduction of overhead costs for €(115) million (""Autumn"" plan) and adaptation of the production setup for €(32) million, including the United Kingdom for €(14) million, Germany for €(8) million, France for €(3) million, Spain for €(3) million and the U.S.A. for €(2) million.

Costs related to the integration of Bombardier Transportation were recorded for an amount of €(142) million. €(118) million charges were related to some legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business mainly for two projects - in U.S.A. and in Turkey, and for legal fees in the context of the claim against Bombardier Inc. €(30) million were related to impairment of assets due to the exit from Russia. Other exceptional expenses were recorded for €(73) million, of which €(36) million of consequential impacts from restructuring plan already initiated in Germany.

Alstom's EBIT before amortisation and impairment of assets exclusively valued when determining the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") stood at €356 million. This compares to €366 million for the last fiscal year.

The share in net income from equity investments amounted to €7 million, excluding the amortisation of the purchase price allocation (""PPA"") from Chinese joint ventures of €(10) million.

Adjusted net profit, representing the group's share of net profit from continued operations excluding PPA net of tax, amounts to €44 million for the fiscal year 2023/24. This compares to an adjusted net profit of €292 million during the last fiscal year.

The Group's Net profit/(loss) (Group share) stood at €(309) million for the fiscal year 2023/24, compared to €(132) million last fiscal year.

***

The Group's Free Cash Flow stands at €(557) million for the fiscal year 2023/24 as compared to €199 million during the last fiscal year and €(1,119) million at the first half of fiscal year 2023/24. Cash generation was impacted over the full year by an unfavourable €(856) million change in working capital compared to €(219) million in the last fiscal year; mostly due to change in Trade Working Capital as well as the reversal effect of the change in law on VAT in France for €(380) million. The Contract Working Capital is positively impacted by the acceleration of deliveries from major contracts in the second half of the year, strong collections of down payments as well as reduction of provision for risk on contracts.

On 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a net debt position of €(2,994) million.

In addition to its available cash and cash equivalents, amounting to €976 million on 31 March 2024, the Group benefits from strong liquidity with:

The first facility has two six-month extension options remaining at borrowers' discretion. Alstom will, however, terminate its €2.25 billion credit facility agreement following execution of the deleveraging plan.

The last two facilities have been successfully extended by one year. On 31 March 2024, the €1.75 billion RCF line had been drawn down for €175 million, while the other two lines remained undrawn.

As per its conservative liquidity policy, the €2.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility serves as a back-up of the Group €2.5 billion Negotiable European Commercial Papers program in place. With these RCF lines (€175 million drawn on the RCF on 31 March 2024), the €1.03 billion of Neu CP outstanding on 31 March 2024, the Group benefitted from a €6.3 billion liquidity available.

***

Decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom's strategy. The Group is reducing its Scope 1 & 2 emissions reaching 139 ktonCO2e (representing a 39% decrease compared to March 2022), while collaborating with suppliers and customers on reducing its Scope 3 footprint. First results of this collaboration can be seen through the reduction of emissions intensity of sold product reaching 4.0 gCO2e/pass.km (i.e. (13)% compared to March 2022). Alstom CO2e emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6 of July 2023 by the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement commitments.

The supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase Agreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a 10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom's electricity consumption in Europe, so this is a major step in reaching the target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables.

Regarding Diversity & Inclusion, the Alstom in Motion (AiM) 2025 strategy targets to reach 28% of women managers, engineers and professionals' roles by 2025. As of end of March 2024, 24.7% of manager, engineer and professional roles are held by women. Alstom will continue to accelerate its efforts in the coming months.

Alstom's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group maintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the third consecutive year and the DJSI for the 13 consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to ECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. In addition, in 2024, Alstom improved is CDP rating, moving from B to A-. Those results reflect its strong position and strategy on Sustainability.

In addition, Alstom published for the second year European Taxonomy-aligned KPIs about Sales, Capex and Opex, pursuing strong analysis initiated last year. EU Taxonomy-aligned sales amounted to 60% and ranked Alstom among best in class, confirming the importance of the sector in which Alstom operates in achieving the EU's ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU Taxonomy purpose is to redirect capital flows towards sustainable activities and help navigate transition to a low carbon economy.

The outlook for FY 2024/25 is based on following main assumptions:

Considering the slight dilution from disposals and the revised timing of the impact from industrial optimisation, the Group expects to reach this profitability range in FY 2026/27, versus FY 2025/26 previously.

APPENDIX 4 - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INDICATORS DEFINITIONS

This section presents financial indicators used by the Group that are not defined by accounting standard setters.

Orders received

A new order is recognised as an order received only when the contract creates enforceable obligations between the Group and its customer. When this condition is met, the order is recognised at the contract value. If the contract is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting unit, the Group requires the immediate elimination of currency exposure using forward currency sales. Orders are then measured using the spot rate at inception of hedging instruments.

Book-to-Bill

The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to the amount of sales traded for a specific period.

Gross margin % on backlog

Gross Margin % on backlog is a KPI that presents the expected performance level of firm contracts in backlog. It represents the difference between the sales not yet recognized and the cost of sales not yet incurred from the contracts in backlog. This % is an average of the portfolio of contracts in backlog and is meaningful to project mid- and long-term profitability.

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA

Adjusted Gross Margin before PPA is a KPI that presents the level of recurring operational performance. It represents the sales minus the cost of sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination as well as significant, non-recurring ""one off"" items that are not expected to occur again in subsequent years.

EBIT before PPA

Following the Bombardier Transportation acquisition and with effect from the fiscal year 2021/22 condensed consolidated financial statements, Alstom decided to introduce the ""EBIT before PPA"" KPI aimed at restating its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"") to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination. This KPI is also aligned with market practice.

Adjusted EBIT

Adjusted EBIT (""aEBIT"") is the Key Performance Indicator to present the level of recurring operational performance. This indicator is also aligned with market practice and comparable to direct competitors.

Starting September 2019, Alstom has opted for the inclusion of the share in net income of the equity-accounted investments into the aEBIT when these are considered to be part of the operating activities of the Group (because there are significant operational flows and/or common project execution with these entities). This mainly includes Chinese joint-ventures, namely CASCO joint-venture for Alstom as well as, following the integration of Bombardier Transportation, Alstom Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. (formerly Bombardier Sifang), Bombardier NUG Propulsion System Co. Ltd and Changchun Changke Alstom Railway Vehicles Company Ltd (formerly Changchun Bombardier).

aEBIT corresponds to Earning Before Interests and Tax adjusted for the following elements:

A non-recurring item is a ""one-off"" exceptional item that is not supposed to occur again in following years and that is significant.

Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT expressed as a percentage of sales.

EBITDA + JV dividends

EBITDA before PPA plus dividends from joint ventures is the EBIT before PPA, before depreciation and amortisation, with the addition of the dividends received from joint ventures.

Adjusted net profit

The ""Adjusted Net Profit"" KPI restates Alstom's net profit from continued operations (Group share) to exclude the impact of amortisation of assets exclusively valued when determining the PPA in the context of business combination, net of the corresponding tax effect. This indicator is also aligned with market practice.

Free cash flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalised development costs, net of proceeds from disposals of tangible and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow does not include any proceeds from disposals of activity.

The most directly comparable financial measure to Free Cash Flow calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS is net cash provided by operating activities.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations ""FFO"" in the EBIT to FCF statement refers to the Free Cash Flow generated by Operations, before Working Capital variations.

Trade Working Capital is the Working Capital that is not strictly related to contract. It includes all the elements of the working capital but

Net cash/(debt)

The net cash/(debt) is defined as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other current financial asset, less borrowings.

Pay-out ratio

The pay-out ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the overall dividend with the ""Adjusted Net profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, Group share"" as presented in the management report in the consolidated financial statements.

Organic basis

This press release includes performance indicators presented on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Figures given on an organic basis eliminate the impact of changes in scope of consolidation and changes resulting from the translation of the accounts into Euro following the variation of foreign currencies against the Euro.

The Group uses figures prepared on an organic basis both for internal analysis and for external communication, as it believes they provide means to analyse and explain variations from one period to another. However, these figures are not measurements of performance under IFRS.

You don't know when to turn the seat belt sign on. If you leave it on all the time, people are going to ignore it. They'll get up and walk anyway to use the restroom. You can expect the seat belt sign won't be on more than likely when you encounter this unexpected turbulence. >> Linda: if you can't see it coming, clear turbulence as a pilot, what can you do beyond quickly turning that seat belt light on? >> Well, by then it's too late. We have speeds called turbulence penetration speeds. If we had anticipated the turbulence, we could have slowed the airplane to that particular speed. Because there's no warning, we can't do anything. Once the turbulence occurs, turn on the seat belt sign on it's really too late. Folks don't have time to fasten their belts to get to their seats. >> Linda: we had a pretty similar incident even more severe earlier this week. A man dying of suspected heart attack, dozens injured in a flight to singapore. Given that these incidents happened just days apart and we heard of recent incidents that are similar as well. How do you think this is affecting the public's perception about flight safety? >> Well, you're going to incur a certain amount of turbulence as well as normal turbulence. If you fasten your seat belt, it's probably not going to bother you. It's the folks that didn't do that that got injured. It's easy to prevent injury. That's the main takeaway. Passengers have to be prepared at any time to anticipate some turbulence. >> Linda: that's aviation expert and former airline pilot keith mackey. For the first time in months, hamas has hit central israel with rocket attacks. Militant group says it launched a barrage of projectile from rafah in southern gaza. Journalist irris makler is in jerusalem and has the details. >> Reporter: what we know is that the barrage of something like eight rockets, crossed into israeli airspace. Most of them were intercepted. There was minor injuries, minor damage. Very few injuries to people. Nevertheless, most of that was injuries from shrapnel. Israelis in the centre of the country were running to the bomb shelters. Airport was closed. It did have an impact on israel. What hamas said it's interesting. It's been four months since the last barrage to central israel. Hamas claimed responsibility. Pretty smartly. They said they were doing it in retaliation to israel's massacre. What israel says is this. They are firing from rafah. That's also significant. They are firing from rafah as israeli troops advance. They know once those rockets and weapons are located, they will destroy them. They are using it before they can be destroyed. Nevertheless, they have given some ammunition to right wing politicians in israel who say how can you stop fighting in rafah when there's still sufficient weapons there to be fired into central israel? >> Linda: this latest escalation came after eight trucks came through israel to bypass the rafah crossing through egypt. What can you tell us about that? >> Reporter: hundreds of trucks were lined outside the rafah crossing since israel took that crossing on may 6th. It's not far, 5 kilometres down the road to an israeli border crossing. They are going in from there. Some 200 trucks ready to go in. Much of the food has already spoiled. We have heard from palestinian sources inside the gaza strip that eight trucks had gone in with fuel and cooking gas. That is significant. What's coming in from the other pier that the U.S. set up is a smaller amount of aid. It's more expensive to get in. It doesn't come in the same quantity. Everybody is advocating for aid to come in by land through the old system through these border crossings. However, the problem is distribution. What we're hearing from the owner of the U.N. refugee agency, once it gets in it's hard to get it out. Especially to the something like 900,000 palestinians estimated to be on the coast having fled rafah. How do you get them to the coastal area. There's nothing there but the

but the tents that they put up. There's no infrastructure. All of those issues, has to be said the fact that some aid is going in. >> Linda: that's irris makler in jerusalem. Representatives from dozens of countries are in brussels to talk about the future of the palestinian authority. The meeting comes just days before three european countries are set to recognise a palestinian state. >> The palestinian government calls on all states that have not yet recognised the state of palestine to take this principle decision as soon as possible. >> Linda: that was palestinian prime minster today thanking spain, norway and ireland for their decision to officially recognise the palestinian state later this week. He calls on the international community to pressure israel for a cease-fire. Today's meeting in brussels is a chance for countries to exchange views about the plans and priorities of the palestinian authority which currently controls the west bank. Several european countries say that the palestinian authority should take over the control of gaza from hamas. Meanwhile, at the university of toronto, organizers from a pro-palestinian encampment have released a counter proposal they plan to present to school officials later today. >> This process is slow. Bureaucratic and archaic. We reject playing a game that will go nowhere. Our counteroffer is built on the fact that the office of the president has the ability to create new processes and make decisions on divestments. >> Linda: they want the university of toronto to divest fully from israel and suspend any ties to the country. The counterproposal will be handed to school officials ought 5:00 P.M. eastern time. Protesters have been issued a trespass notice and told to leave by 8:00 tomorrow morning. U of t presented an a ever last week that the school says claims has investment in weapons manufacturing companies in israel has no bases in fact. Also in toronto, police are searching for multiple suspects who fired gunshots at a jewish girl elementary school. >> Suspects arrived at the school in a vehicle. Dark coloured vehicle. They exited the vehicle and opened fire at the school causing damage to the front of the school. The suspect then got back in the vehicle and left the area. There were no reported sound of gunshots at the time. There was no reported injuries. >> Linda: the force hate crime unit is helping with the investigation and police are increasing their presence in the local community. Prime minster justin trudeau and ontario premier doug ford have taken to social media to condemn the shooting and call it an act of anti-semitism. The prime minster will attend ceremonies marking the 80th verse of the d-day landing in france next month. It will be the first time justin trudeau has attended the event since the 75th anniversary in 2019. More than 14,000 canadian soldiers landed or parachuted into france on june 6, 1944. Suffering more than a thousand casualties that day including 359 killed. The battle of normandy saw 5000 canadian troops lose their lives. Thousands more wounded. We're back in just a moment.

The ukrainian president called on U.S. joe biden and chinese leader xi jinping to take part in a peace summit in switzerland next month. The U.S. will take part but didn't say who or at what level. The summit is approaching as russian forces advance on the eastern front and continues to target the northeastern city of kharkiv. Bomb and missile strikes there saturday killed four people and wounded dozens of others. Ukraine is hoping the meeting in switzerland will help increase international pressure on russian president vladimir putin. U.S. presidential hopeful donald trump was heckled last night while campaigning at the the libertarian national convention. >> I think you should nominate me and vote for me. We should win together. >> Linda: trump's supporters and libertarians repeatedly clashed during the event. Resulting in several members of the audience being escorted out of the building. Trump is hoping to appeal libertarians ahead what is forecast to be a tight election this november. The campaign stop underscores the focus of trump's campaign on third party candidates. This week, british prime minster rishi sunak announced earlier an expected general alex. -- election. Scott lucasabilitys the election campaign will be all about the economy. >> The starting point is simply that britain is not in a better place under the tories who have led a coalition or been the sole party in power since 2010. The situation has gotten far worse through the combination of the covid pandemic and the u.k.'s self-inflicted wound of leaving the european union. G.D.P. is probably going to suffer in relative terms by 8% to 9% by 2030 because of that decision in the european union. Trade suffered. Investment has suffered. Inflation is down to 2.3% now. That fall is not as much as economist were expecting because of our year on year drop on energy prices. I think the prospect of U.K. economy is not good. Beyond that, the day-to-day public services that have been better off british society, a transport system that serves all people, housing, education. Those are at breaking point and because the government has a serious funding crisis in part, because of the damage trade, damage investment, damage to manufacturing with brexit. It doesn't have the money to repair those public services. >> Linda: scott lucas from the clinton institute at university college dublin. Stay with us. More news just ahead.

The fans that inspired that canadian classic is back. He was the co-writer on brian adams hit ""summer of 69"". It was inspired by his first band. Last night they reunited at their old stomping ground. The school in british columbia. It -- they played songs and relived some of the best kays kay -- days of their lives. We spoke to jim valance earlier and how they came up with ""summer of 69"" >> We kept in touch all these years. I met these guys when I was 13 in grade eight. My dad got moved every two years. We kept in touch after that. I see them once a decade may be, go back to school reunion or something. Last night was special. It was the first time we actually played together in more than 60 years. Brian and I started off, before I met him I was in a canadian band. Once I met brian in 1978, it was not overnight success. We worked really hard for the better part of five years before brian and I got together. As things progressed and the phone starts to ring, you have a hit and people want to write with you. It kind of becomes your normal. There's no pressure. It's hard work but really enjoyable. Sometimes I stop and think to myself, it's been a wonderful ride. I have to say. Brian and I sitting in the room and we started that song with a discussion about what do you want to write about today. We decided we would write about our first band or first guitars or first girlfriends. One line at a time the page starts to fill up with lyrics. We finished the song in a day or two. It was called ""best days of your life."" it stayed like that for a month.

we had a better title somewhere. Tucked away in the first verse was it was the summer of 69. We thought summer of 69. That's got a great ring to it. If you remember your english class, it's called alliteration, ""summer of 69"" we took that phrase and shoe horned it later in the song and changed the title of the song. >> Linda: jim valance speaking to us earlier from british columbia.

We begin another mid-air incident that left multiple people injured. It happened on a qatar airways plane flying from the middle east to dublin. Cbc's albert delitala is looking into what happened. >> Reporter: 12 people were injured when that qatar airways flight hit turbulence on its way to dublin. The airport does say that it landed safely and on time. But certainly, some scary moments.

let's show you on a map just where it happened. The airport confirms the qatar airways flight hit turbulence while flying over turkiye. The incident reportedly lasting less than 20 seconds according to passengers. It happened during the food and drink service on the plane. Six passengers and six crew reported injuries. You can see some of the scenes there after that plane safely landed meeting emergency crew when it did on the ground. Here's some passengers who spoke to irish public broadcaster R.T.E. after they got off the plane. >> We were all over the plane and everywhere. [ indiscernible ] >> Flight attendant went into the air. Food went everywhere. It was panic everywhere. >> Reporter: the airline calls the injuries minor and said that those who were injured are receiving medical attention. It didn't directly comment on the turbulence. It did say that an internal investigation is happening into that incident. >> Linda: sounds like a pretty harrowing incident according to the passengers on that flight. It also sounds like we're hearing about these things more frequently lately. This comes just days after a fatal incident on a singapore airlines flight. Tell us more about that. >> Reporter: that was on tuesday singapore airlines flight. That flight hit severe turbulence on its way to singapore from london. A 73-year-old british man died of suspected heart attack. You can see some of the scenes on that plane after all of that. 20 people sent to the I.C.U. the U.S. transportation safety board says turbulence is the most common kind of airplane incident. Most of those incidents result in one or more serious injuries. One airline say the analyst says turbulence is becoming more common with climate change. That airlines are adjusting their planes accordingly. >> Over the last 20 years, [ indiscernible ] multiscan, which is mentioned really good picture of what the weather is like ahead. They are making progress into turbulence detection as well. Also, airlines are now sharing data between aircraft encounters with turbulence everybody can be advised that's on that same flight track. >> Reporter: in terms of that singapore airline incident, the airlines says it is cooperating with investigators on the investigation there. That plane that returned to singapore today from bangkok where it made that emergency landing. Many of the passengers remain in bangkok where they are being treated. >> Linda: that was cbc's albert delitala. Keith mackey the former airline pilot and aviation expert. He spoke to us how to protect yourself. >> Reporter: apparently they were secking meals. Settlement of the injured were flight attendants. They were walking about the cabinets to get the meals out. Other six passengers injured, I would wager were not fastening their seat belts. If this occurs and it can happen very suddenly without any warning at all. If you're not strapped in there's a good chance you'll get brain and upper spinal injuries. While you're seated, keep that belt fastened. Not loosely fastened but keep it firmly fastened. If you're in a car wreck, you wouldn't want to have a loosely fastened seat belt. >> Linda: the turbulence that they hit, are there any clues that you can glean from what we're hearing about the flight about what this airplane encountered? >> Well, here's the situation. If you have no turbulence, if flying through area of thunderstorms. You know the storms are there. You warn the people what to expect. Usually if it's some turbulence associated with it. It's not for naught turning the seat belt sign on. When you get through, you can turn the sign off. You don't know when to turn the seat belt sign on. If you leave it on all the time,

But lionel messi won't be joining his inter miami teammates when they play the whitecaps tonight. And that has fans kicking up a fuss. Michelle morton has the details. >> Now it's rojas creating a chaos. Played ahead. Fires. Goal! Lionel messi. >> Reporter: this is the star player tens of thousands of soccer fans have been waiting to see at B.C. place. >> It's a thrilling finish for messi. >> Reporter: that dream has been benched. Lionel messi is one of a handful of key players that will be a no-show in saturday's match. The whitecaps first announced the news thursday in a statement saying unfortunately we have no control over who plays for our opponent and it was important for us to communicate to our fans as soon as possible. The next day the head coach for inter miami offered this explanation. >> You look at the upcoming matching around the corner. In this location, obviously we have two home games. And we thought that it was the most prudent for them not to play this match. >> Reporter: major league soccer says the league will continue to review how clubs report player availability. Tickets had been starting at around $300. Now prices have plummeted. >> Two flights from edmonton and then you've got two days hotel and then you've got two tickets at reg price. So $330 a ticket. So it adds up. >> Personally I'm a pretty big fan. It would have been exciting to see him. I was disappointed but still happy to come and excited to go to the game. >> It's like only messi was there that we wanted to see. I'm a liverpool fan, too. It would have been good to see suarez. >> Like regular games usually $30 to $60, you know. But after messi not showing up, you know, they should refund people money. >> I understand their frustration. And I can tell them we share their frustration. As I said before, I think there's no one more disappointed and frustrated than our players. Because the one thing is to come to this event. The other thing is to be understated at this event. >> Reporter: the whitecaps say they'll still make the game a special one for fans, by hosting a large street party and offering in-stadium food and drinks at half price. A record 55,000 people are expected at saturday's match. Michelle morton, cbc news, vancouver. >> Marianne: the nhl stanley cup playoffs continue tonight in texas. Edmonton was able to steal a game in the western final opener on thursday night. >> Scores. It's over. 32 seconds in and redirected from the slot. >> Marianne: oilers' captain connor McDAVID'S O.T. winner overshadowed the double minor penalty that he took when overtime started. The penalty killers are crucial in the playoffs, successfully shutting down 19 consecutive power plays. Edmonton goaltender stuart skinner has three-straight wins since returning to the crease in game six of the second round. Game two happens tonight in dallas. >> He's hit bilaler. To centre. Knocks it down. [Cheers and Applause] [Buzzer] >> Marianne: and in the eastern final last night, goodrose scored in overtime to give the new york rangers a 2-1 win over the florida panthers. That levels the best-of-seven eastern finals 1-1. The teams move south to florida for game three tomorrow afternoon.

Coming up, a difficult week for israel on the international front. We'll examine the growing diplomatic isolation and the impact it could have on the war with hamas. >>> Also ahead, the remains of an unknown soldier from newfoundland, who died in france during the first world war, are on their way home. We'll show you the solemn ceremony that took place earlier in beaumont-hamel, france. >>> And the edmonton oilers will try to take full control of their semi-final series against the stars tonight in dallas. >>> But we begin with ongoing tensions on some of this country's leading university campuses. School officials at the university of toronto are waiting for a response, after issuing a trespass notice to pro-palestinian protesters. Students set up an encampment more than three weeks ago protesting the ongoing war in gaza. The cbc's albert delitala has been reporting on this since the occupation started. He joins us now with the latest. Albert, they issued the notice. So what happens next? >> Reporter: well, linda, we're counting down towards 8:00 A.M. local time on monday. That's the new deadline the protesters have to leave campus or potentially face a five-year suspension or even expulsion from the university. And that comes after more than three weeks of an encampment set up there. And that was in solidarity to the protests we've seen across north america. Pro-palestinian protests that seek to cede the war between israel and hamas end. So that offer, though, that they were considering -- they did decline the offer. And in it the university said they would not end partnerships with israeli universities. That was one of their demands. Also they invited students to attend a board of governing council meeting next month, when they could present their demands there. They also offered to make a working group, to consider options around disclosure and increasing transparency of their investments and other demands the students were making. They were to accept that by 4:00 P.M. yesterday. That was the deadline. They rejected that offer. They said that the university was essentially offering them a process that already existed. And they want commitments instead around their demands. Here's one protester who said they remain resolute around all of this. >> Do not plan to leave any time soon. The reason they issued this notice. They put out the first offer yesterday. More of an ultimatum that they're framing as the final offer. U. Of t. Knows how to bargain. They bargained with unions on campus all the time. The first written offer cannot be the final offer. So we are currently preparing our counteroffer and hopefully we're able to discuss that at the 5:00 P.M. meeting on sunday. >> Reporter: a representative with hello ontario spoke with cbc news. The group advocates for jewish students. He didn't answer as to whether he wants to see police go into the encampment, but he did say that it has to end. >> Ultimately what we want is we want piece. We want co-existence. And we want to be able to study and learn and live and work on a campus with everybody. And unfortunately these unlawful occupations have brought intimidation and hatred to campuses and it's time that university leaders across the province and across the country and our government leaders and well-meaning canadians stand up and say enough. >> Reporter: meanwhile, at McMASTER university in hamilton, west of toronto, a very different situation there. You can see some recent images of that encampment that's been going on there for about three weeks. It's set to come down today, that's after students reached an agreement with the university. That framework includes human rights considerations in their international agreements and also an annual disclosures of all of the direct investments they make. >> Linda: and, albert, in montreal a university there has filed an injunction against protesters. What do we know about that? >> Reporter: that's what the université du québec montreal. And that university filed an injunction, as you said, against the students encamping on their campus for over a week now. We have some pictures of that situation. They're actually seeking for those tents and other objects they've set up to not be closer than three meet piers -- metres

away from buildings. They say safety is a concern. They also allege that vandalism has taken place. A lot of those accusations the students do deny. The judge in the case has yet to rule, but says that safety will be top of mind in that decision. Linda. >> Linda: thanks, albert. >> Reporter: you're welcome. >> Linda: and turning to the situation in gaza now. There are new moves to kickstart cease-fire talks between israel and hamas, even as israeli forces defy a U.N. court order and international pressure by continuing their assault on rafah. [shots fired] israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu insists the ground and air offensive in the city must go on. That's to root out militants. But behind the scenes diplomatic manoeuvres are under way in paris to bring about a truce that will end the bloodshed and see a new hostage release. Journalist irris makler is keeping an eye on those developments in paris and joins us now from jerusalem. So, irris, what more can you tell us about the latest efforts to finally get to some sort of a deal? >> Reporter: well, at the moment it just talks about talks. But it is significant, linda. What we've seen is an announcement in the past few hours that there was -- there were these meetings in paris between the cia chief, the israeli chief, the qatari prime minister. They say that talks will resume. Next week there's talks between the same three parties and also egypt and then hamas will be brought in. So that is I suppose optimistic, because we haven't seen any talks on this issue for more than two weeks. It's significant false because of the i.c.j., the international court of justice, orders to israel to stop fighting and particularly to protect the civilians in gaza. And because that order was some 24 hours ago. In that time, we have seen continued fighting. Israel says it is finding more tunnels, finding more weapons of militants. The hamas-run health ministry in gaza says in that period, there have been dozens more casualties. Dozens more deaths of palestinians. If there were to be talks and if there was another way to solve this issue, this deadlock, it would be very welcomed. >> Linda: irris, providing aid was central to the world court's ruling against israel. What can you tell us about any advances there? >> Reporter: there has been a breakthrough brought by guess after a conversation between U.S. president joe biden and the egyptian president. Aid will be able to enter from egypt via the israeli crossing point of shalom. That's significant. Usually that aid goes in from rafah. But for the past 19 days, since israel entered rafah on may the 6th, no aid has been going in. You know, israel and egypt blame each other for that. But in a way, it's not significant who is to blame. What is important is that there are hundreds of trucks lining up on that border at the moment. Aid is not getting in, fresh food is rotting there. This is a huge advance. The important thing once the aid gets in, will it be able to be distributed. Will it be able to be distributed to the some 900,000 people estimated to have moved out of rafah, to tents in an area called almalosi on the coast. Very small area. They need the humanitarian aid. I guess that's the aim right now. >> Linda: thanks for this, irris. That's irris makler in jerusalem.

>>> Well, rescue crews continue to search for hundreds of people feared buried by a major landslide in papua new guinea. Friday's early morning landslide swept away dozens of homes and covered many highways and buildings under mounds of mud and rock. The slide hit a remote area about 600 kilometres northwest of the capital port morseby. Dominic valitis has the latest. >> Reporter: the massive landslide hit papua new guinea's isolated enga province around 3:00 A.M. local time on friday. Several villages in the area were affected. Hundreds of homes were buried. And it's still not clear just how many people were killed as a result. But there are reports today that more than 300 people died in just one of those affected villages. So the authorities are certainly warning that the number of dead is expected to rise. We have been seeing more footage coming in from the scene today. Desperate images of villagers digging through soil for survivors. It is a heartbreaking scene to watch and extremely dangerous for those on the ground. Because the area is still very, very unstable. Now we understand that some emergency workers have arrived at the scene. But as you can imagine, they are facing some considerable challenges on the ground. Here's chris jensen, the national director for the charity world vision papua new guinea. Take a listen. >> At this stage with such large amount of debris, I think, you know, it's obviously they're looking at the worst-case scenario. We've got large amounts of teams from the provincial authorities, as well as national government authorities doing assessments, carrying out analysis on what exactly is required as we look at responding. >> Reporter: part of the problem is that enga province is an isolated place. It's several hundred kilometres from the capital of papua new guinea. The conditions on the ground in the affected areas are giving emergency teams real problems. Officials say that the debris caused by this landslide is in some parts about eight metres deep and covers more 200 square kilometres of land, including a large stretch of the only highway in and out of enga province. Dominic valitis, cbc news, london. >> Linda: an unknown soldier who served during the first world war has begun his journey home. These are some of the scenes from a ceremony earlier this morning in beaumont-hamel, france. Members of the canadian armed forces personally accepted the unknown soldier's casket. Premier andrew furey was also in attendance with his family and so was our reporter heather gillis. She'll have a report on the next phase of the journey coming up a bit later on cbc news network.

Available now onCBC Listen or wherever you get your podcasts. >> Linda: well, it's been a tough week for the israeli government and especially for its prime minister benjamin netanyahu. It started with an arrest warrant request by the international criminal court and ended with the u.n.'s top court ordering israel to immediately halt its offensive in rafah. In between three countries announced they'll recognize a palestinian state.

Thanks for being with us today. >> Interview: thank you, linda. >> Linda: a lot to unpack here. I want to start with what happened yesterday. The international court of justice calling on israel to end its military operation in rafah. Israel has vowed they say, quote, no power on earth will stop it from protecting its citizens and going after hamas in gaza. I'm wondering what you think this ruling changes when it comes to israel's war efforts? >> Interview: absolutely. Well, look, the court can't enforce the ruling, you about the united states can. The court of opinion matters at the white house. And clearly from an operational point of view, and if you look at it as surgery, this is an an arthroscopic attack on rafah than a bone saw. The united states can moderate israel's behaviour and we have some leverage, because nothing speaks louder than weapons and they're heavily dependent on america for weapons. >> Linda: as we mentioned, this isn't the only thing that's happened this week. Going back to earlier in the week, the top prosecutor at theismat thei.c.c. Said they would seek arrest warrants for netanyahu and his defense minister. How significant was that from your perspective? >> Interview: I think it's fascinating. Look, from the outside looking in, this is flat-out bad. Unprecedented rulings. From netanyahu's view, it's a little more nuanced for several reasons. First of all, he was undergoing attacks from inside his own war cabinet domestically, politically. These rulings rally even his opposition around him. Sort of rallying around the israeli flag. The second thing is it validates netanyahu's point of view, which is the world hates israel no matter what it does. We need to proceed in order to survive. I would rather be alive and hated than loved than dead is his flosscy -- philosophy. Being a kind of bad guy for where netanyahu is sitting, it's not a bad thing. He hinted towards the treaty with saudi arabia recently, countries don't make treaties with the weak. This is all about since october 7th, proving that israel can be strong again. And the dramatic attack on october 7th. >> Linda: we also had signals from other it countries like spain, ireland and norway, who said this week that they would recognize palestinian statehood. Some viewed that as a signal of waning global support for israel. How much of a blow do you think diplomatically this was for israel? >> Interview: well, one thing I learned in the state department, where we unsuccessfully tried to negotiate peace is timing is the fairy dust of diplomacy. The timing of this announcement didn't really have much effect on the ground in rafah. And it just depends on what happens next. If the united states can pull out the cease-fire and then roll that into what our original goal was, was greater regional integration, more prosperous middle east, that's what we were

Just maybe you want to bolster what I was just saying, julia, what stood out to you as you listened to what the president was laying out there. >> Perhaps not a big surprise with the verdict but still a stark assessment of the situation in gaza, particularly since israel started its offensive in rafah. Just a couple of weeks ago. And the deterioration as the president of the international court was painting a picture of a very difficult situation in terms of the humanitarian conditions on the ground, and he was referencing particularly the facts that there had been evacuation orders issued in advance by israel, warning that it was going into rafah, that led to the displacement of some 800,000 people, according to the united nations. And what I think was interesting from this ruling was the fact that the judges found that that wasn't good enough, the fact that there had been advance warning. They said that the situation to where -- where the people had been moved to simply wasn't good enough, they were living without roofs, without water, without any kind of sanitary conditions, and of course very limited access to aid, which is why the icj has made its judgment that the rafah crossing needs to be reopened. We've been hearing major concerns about the fact that since israel took control of the gaza side of that crossing, there hasn't been any aid coming from egypt into gaza over the last couple of weeks. And although there are other routes and israel has insisted that it isn't blocking aid, that's been a major sticking point for aid groups where we heard the judges talking about the world food program, not having access to a warehouse in rafah as well. So a really stark picture of what's going on there, but, yes, the headlines effectively that the court is ordering israel to halt its rafah offensive, open the rafah crossing and allow investigators in to ensure that israel is complying with an order from earlier in the year by the icj that it meets to prevent a genocide in gaza. >> Heather: just again, getting a little bit of context to all of this, again, ordering the stop to the rafah incursion, some had expected the icj could go even further and order a stop to the entire wars the entire offensive in gaza broadly, that has not happened, nor did it happen with the initial ruling back in january. So this is rafah specific. Interesting that the votes in all of these were 13-2, and the american representative on the international court who's a justice by the name of sarah haul cleveland, she voted were the majority, so she voted in favour of these provisional measures. In terms of the southwestern ontario come of this, this is legally bind bug there is no power to enforce these orders from the international court of justice. By way of understanding, this is brought by south africa, it's part of the larger case, south africa alleges that israel has been involved in acts of genocide. It filed that back last december and this is part of what's making its way through the international court of justice. The main case which deals with that main accusation of genocide it's not expected to start until next we are. Israel has of course denied the case, but this is part of that within what is being investigated and that's part of the, as you said, julia, must be open to any investigators lookings at some of these allegations and looking for evidence. So this is the context to the ruling today. We already know, again, not able to be enforced, israel has already made it clear it will nod adhere to this, whatever it was going to be. No power on earth will stop israel from protecting its citizens and going after hamas in gaza. That's what a government spokesperson has already said. So what is this likely to lead to, as far as israel's response, and I would also like you to look, julia, if you could, to how the world will respond, the kind of isolation, the kind of criticism that we may hear as a result of what the icj has just ruled. >> Well, absolutely. I mean, israel did defend itself at the court last week because it is a member of the united nations and it has to effectively put forward its rebuttal to the south african allegations, so certainly it has been participating in these proceedings and although they are legally binding, as you say, incredibly difficult to enforce on the ground, south africa continuing to press israel on its actions in gaza and although the broader genocide case could take many years, it wants to see pressure put on israel at every stage, particularly as the situation on the ground is evolving. Certainly, we have seen israel already dismiss international courts' efforts to intervene in gaza, saying that israel didn't start this war, it didn't want this war, and it needs to carry out its offensive, it says, in rafah because it's -- the last stronghold of hamas. It says that's necessary to route out hammond every hamas.

certainly that has been its perspective, and although it will be difficult to enforce this, there does add to a growing sense of pressure and isolation on israel, there have been many countries expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza and specifically about the situation in rafah as well which the united states warned against this offensive, although we heard a couple of days ago that the U.S. said no red lines had been crossed there so far. But it does certainly -- verdicts like this, judgments like the icj's judgment today do add to that pressure and help shape the international response, for example, in russia when the icj ruled that its invasion of ukraine was unlawful, that certainly added some legal weight to many countries giving weapons to ukraine. So that is the kind of picture we are expecting going forward there. Could be stronger responses from western countries as this situation in gaza continues. >> We already had, as you and I were talking about, the three countries, spain, ireland and norway going ahead to declare that they will declare an official palestinian state as of next week. Again, as part of this international pressure and growing international condemnation. Julia, thank you. I will let you go for now. Julia chapman going to continue watching the story out of our bureau in london. And as we return to the scenes outside, we do see a small group of pro-palestinian demonstrators. We would expect reaction to come to this judgment from the international court of justice. What we've seen previously is the lawyers for south africa will respond and also the legal team for israel as well. But julia raises a number of questions, what will come of all of this? Will there be suddenly today or increasingly international condemnation? Will any countries go to the point of new sanctions and will there be, as some have been concerned about from the israeli perspective, will this then lead the united nations security council to declare some new form of declaration which would then require the united states to use its veto power in support of israel in all of this? There are many diplomatic and political repercussions to come even if there is no power to enforce this decision just out from the international court of justice.

The icj has ordered israel to keep the rafah border crossing open, to allow investigators access to the gaza territory, and to report back on the measures israel has taken in one month's time. This is all in response to a request from south africa for a cease-fire, the court's ruling is legally binding, but the icj cannot enforce it and israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. >> Outrage over the war in gaza continues to spark strong reaction and protest in this country. A pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto's main campus has just over six hours left to respond to the school's latest bid to end the demonstration. Meagan fitzpatrick is on campus today. >> The university publicly released the offer that has been presented to students at around :30 yesterday. So it outlines the proposed responses to the protesters' demands. When it comes to the students' demands around u of t divesting from companies that support the israeli military, that's one of the demands of the students, not to have any university money invested in those kinds of companies, the university is proposing to set up an advisory committee to do a review of the university's investments, essentially and that advisory committee would be made up of students and staff and faculty and alumni and they are saying representatives from the encampment can suggest membership on that committee and that committee would be asked to report back to the president by no later than the end of october. Also on the students' demand for more disclosure around the university's investments, the school is proposing to set up a working group to look at that, looking at ways of increasing transparency around investments, and that group would be asked to report back by mid july. On the protesters' demand around u of t cutting academic ties with some israeli institutions, the university on that point is essentially saying that's a no go, that the university rejects that demand, saying they will not terminate any partnerships with israeli universities or engage in any academic boycotts. They say they will continue to look at ways of increasing opportunities for palestinian scholars here at the university of toronto. So those are sort of the bare bones of some of the offer that the school is presenting to the protesters. In terms of the timing & this offer now, here's a bit of what the u of. It's president merrick gardener said about that. >> It's also clear that many members of our community feel increasing distress by the presence of the encampment. They feel unsafe, they have reported feelings of -- and experience of discrimination and harassment, we have also had reports of hateful speech and hateful acts which we have reported promptly to toronto police service. After hearing these complaints of our community and after recognizing how long the use of this space has been denied to other members of our community, we felt now is the time to act.

>>> My apologies, that's merrick gertner, not garden temple in he said the offer presented to the student is conditional on them clearing the encampment, not setting it up anywhere else on campus and letting convocation ceremonies proceed uninterrupted. That first convocation ceremony set to be held on june 3rd, right over there. And the president saying those ceremonies will go ahead regardless of whether the students accept this offer. >> That is meagan fitzpatrick on campus at u of t this morning. >> There is breaking news just now from canadian border and customs officers, that they could go on strike as early as next month. In a release just out this morning, their union says workers with cbsa, canada border service agency have voted the 6% in favour of job action. Now, there's no strike date yet, but their union expects to be in an illegal strike position in early june. 90% of border officers are considered essential can't can't walk off the job but it could cause delays for travellers at border crossing as and at airports of course right at the time of the busy holiday season. Now this. >> Hey, this is andrew McCARTHY calling you. >> Hey ally. >> Hey, molly. >> Let's call rob. >> Hello. >> Judge? >> Andrew McCARTHY tracking down the gang for a new documentary about the brat pack.

Also ordering israel to keep the rafah border crossing open for basic supplies for humanitarian aid, to allow investigators access to the territory in gaza to investigate what is at the basis of the south african allegation of genocide, and report back on all measures israel has taken in a month. Those are the four key points from the decision you saw live on cbc morning live, this is all in request for south africa's request for a cease-fire. The ruling is legally binding, the icj cannot enforce it. Israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. Now, we're looking here at live pictures outside the building known as the peace palace, this is the icj, the international court of justice, and we do expect to see as we've seen in past moments on this case lawyers from both sides on the steps of the courthouse responding to the icj decision. We will have that for you live just as soon as we see. As far as reaction, we are just

hearing through reuters from, palestinian authority, here is the statement from the palestinian authority, welcoming the icj decision and saying it represents, quote, an international consensus to end israel's war on gaza. That again from the palestinian presidency, a spokesperson to the reuters news agency. And we will continue to bring you reaction, there is just some reaction and now again to reuters from israel's finance minister, saying that after this ruling, those who demand that israel stop the war are demanding that it should decide to cease to exist, israel will not agree to that. That gives you a sense of the kind of reaction we will see from both sides to come. So we will watch that story very closely through the day here on cbc news network, and just before we go, let's touch base one more time with chris murphy and our forecast heading into the weekend, race weekend in ottawa, all sorts of activities outdoors, all across the country, chris, have a good one. >> Thank you, you too, heather, yeah, big travel weekend in the states, memorial day weekend and again from the upper midwest right down to the southern plains, severe weather there. We've got rain on the north side of our low pressure system. This is the biggest weather maker for today, certainly, in southern manitoba, where we could be looking at more than 50 millimeters worth of rain by the time it ends tomorrow. This is a slow-moving system and locally heavy bands of rain and it's a cold rain, 4° in brandon, 10 in winnipeg, and you will be lucky if you see 10 and we could be getting into wet snow towards riding and turtle and duck mountain, those kind of parts, a little higher elevation. Over towards southern alberta and southern british columbia, another day where we can get some more showers and thunderstorms. Medicine hat has had 110 millimeters of rain so far in may. That is more than double what you would normally get. We could get more thunderstorms there. So there's your heavy rain and wet snow lifting northward, so by tomorrow afternoon, that rain is winding down in the south. More scattered showers and likely thunderstorms into the bc interior and for the south coast, you've got some scattered showers, for the next few days and below seasonal values as well. So the west is getting some beneficial rain, although when you start talking about 50-plus millimeters, we're talking tractors getting stuck in the field. So that's not necessarily good news. But overall, this moisture pattern in the west has been what we needed. Just wish we could get a little bit further north, scattered thunderstorms as mentioned possible, 5 to 15 millimeters of rain for the west coast and this again, portions today, tomorrow, and then there will be more additional rain sunday with those cooler temperatures. Beautiful day in much of the lower great lakes, st. Lawrence river, very warm in the maritimes. Now, keep an eye on your northwest sky because we've got the cold front coming in, so scattered thunderstorms along were it, northwestern new brunswick mid afternoon spreads its way southeastwards through the late afternoon and evening hours, not everybody's going to get a storm, but at this point, we think below severe warning criteria, and there's going to be a chance overnight tonight that southwestern ontario could get a couple of nocturnal storms. That will spread their way eastwards tomorrow, but it's not an all day event saturday. >> The weather update is brought to you by the ""off! Cast"" mosquito forecast.

We begin with breaking news on the israel-hamas war and a ruling just out from the international court of justice in the hague. The judges at the icj had reaffirmed earlier orders in a case brought by south africa, and today they have ordered israel to halt its offensive in rafah. Israel has been ordered to reopen the rafah border crossing to give investigators access and to allow for the flow of aid and humanitarian investors. >> Israel must halt its military actions and any other actions which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza or conditions of life that could bring about the significant destruction. >> A reporter is just outside the court in the hague where that ruling came down. Alex, what can you tell us about the ruling and the potential impact? >> Certainly this ruling we expect would send a clear message and it has done that. The court ordering israel to cease all military operations in rafah. And explaining some of the logic behind that decision. They say the humanitarian situation in rafah can be seen as disastrous, and they are not convinced that israel has put enough in place to cater to that humanitarian support, or to allow for the safe evacuation of civilians. Two fold measures, one, the stopping of all military operations in rafah, and to allow for the axis of the united nations fact-finding mission in rafah as well. Clearly a message from the world court that israel has to do more, must do more, and that things have not approved -- improved since they last ordered israel to do so. Now the bigger question is a bit more complicated. Although these are legally binding orders they are not legally enforceable. The international court of justice says that palestine does not have a police force to enforce these orders. What they can do, or what the un can do is have the security council pass resolutions to sanction israel, force embargoes on israel and have enforcement actions on these orders, but those can be vetoed by the united states. So crucially the relationship between israel and washington dc is not crucial going forward. >> Reporter: as you are speaking, alex -- alex, allegedly hamas has issued a statement, saying that they are urging the security council to implement the icj ruling. Let us move away from the icj for a moment and turn to the icc, where the lead prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant for the israeli prime minister and other top israeli officials, as other -- as well as other members of hamas leadership. Let us talk about the increasing international pressure, presumably, where you are as well, we can hear that screaming, and all the pressure on israel? >> Certainly diplomatic pressure, we have heard spain, ireland and norway saying in a matter of days they will recognize palestinian states. Slovenia and belgium and others should follow suit. But crucially germany and france say the conditions have not been met to recognize palestine as a state, and that remains a big issue. The international criminal court requestinghose arrest warrants , and that decision will be made in a couple of months. That would mean that prime minister netanyahu, defence minister gallant, would not be able to travel to 124 countries around the world, including canada and most of the european union states as well for fear of being arrested. Now also the leadership of hamas , the leaders of hamas who organized the atrocities of october seventh are as well subject to those arrest warrants. But you are right to say that there is a building diplomatic pressure. Perhaps one difference is the new dutch government that will be formed in the next few days, and they seem to be more supportive of israel than the previous one. Globally speaking, more pressure on israel to do more, but there are se excepti >> Natasha: alex caddy eight, at the hague. Thank you. Let us get closer to the actual war. Let us go to gaza, where the israeli army says they have retrieved the bodies of three more hostages killed during the october 7th attack by hamas militants. The military says the recovery was part of a special operation in northern gaza which had seen erce fighting in recent days. Irris makler joins us now from jerusalem. She is tracking not part of the story. What do we know at this stage?

Intense rainfall with each storm and a slight increase of the winds at the core of each storm. The number of the storms is more uncertain given the data that we have. >> Obviously we are talking about here at home, our coast, the atlantic area. How could atlantic canada be affected by this? >> So as these storms develop and move north, they can tap into some of the energy along with the traditional storms that come along. They can merge and have some very intense impacts. Fiona was just two years ago and that brought a lot of devastation. I'm hoping that one of these hurricanes does not bring a lot of damage. We should prepare for a lot of damage this year. >> Lindsey: when does hurricane season begin >> June 1th to november 30th. >> Lindsey: what can we do now to prepare?

Partnering with the people in the europe centre. And our own models within noaa. >> Lindsey: not all of these hurricanes will make landfall, correct? >> Correct.

All right here. Subscribe now atCRAVE.CA. >> This is certainly a surprise to us, but just at depths of need right across the country that unfortunately is not being met with a sense of urgency. Canada has reached a critical turning point as more people are struggling with poverty and food insecurity. >> That was on for too many events. That was not too many things and the person were there. >> 3 young males, including a 15 year-old boy are dead after being stabbed in a fight in montreal. He says at the start and important state. I'm from dallas tonight. Ireland, norway and spain plan to formally recognize a palestinian state move, angering israel. But a welcome by hamas. You're watching ctv news channel. I'm roger petersen. Thank you very much for joining us. >> Well, some sobering numbers when it comes to food insecurity in canada, in its annual poverty report. Cards. Food banks. Canada warns that we have reached a critical point as poverty and food insecurity worsened in every corner of the country. Canada received an overall grade of d minus. That's a drop from the d last year, only to provinces nova scotia and prince edward island managed to improve the rest of the country remain stagnant or worsened. >> Putting together housing plan, looking at yours, social assistance or benefits rates, making sure their indexed to inflation so that people are falling further and further behind into poverty. And then what we're suggesting for provinces that don't and put together a coordinated poverty reduction plan with with target so that you can hold your government to account and citizens can see that your government is taking action. Digging deeper into the numbers. The report found that more than 44% of people are feeling worse off when compared to last year. >> The percentage of people paying more than 30% of their income on housing hit 43.6% in 2024. Joining us now to discuss this further is neil hetherington, the ceo of the daily bread food bank. Neil, thank you for joining us. Unfortunately, you have to join us. >> Unfortunately, this is yet another it's an academic report that showing very clearly what we're feeling on the ground every single day here at the daily bread food bank here in toronto. >> How do we bring about change? I mean, we hear these reports after report after report. What do we do? >> Well, I think that's the frustrating part to us here at the food bank is we know the policy we know what is going on in the city and in the country. A it is a failing mark canadians overall are feeling financially worse off about 50% are financially worse off the year prior than they are this year. And we we know the policy alternatives, we know that it's, there is a lack of affordable housing income supports are not keeping pace and precarious employment is on the rise. >> Now we were seeing from 2021. The usage is up 50% of food banks. Where's that coming from? Is it to people, some people who are already destitute, are they just getting used to be using the food bank's accepted as part of their life or is it are more and more people being driven into situations where they have to turn to you. >> You know, it's, it's new people every single unfortunately are welcoming about 12 to 13,000 torontonians who have never used a food bank before are coming to the food bank for the very first time on a monthly basis. We're growing at 3 to 5% here in city of toronto, each every single month. This past april, there were 311,000 client visits up from about 60,000 and pre-pandemic. So the numbers continue to escalate. And you asked, you know, importantly, who's coming to the food bank individuals more than 50% to have a employment. And yet they can't make ends meet largely because of inflation that has started to, to taper moose. I'm very, very pleased to see the numbers that came out last week or so showing that inflation is under 3%. On the right trajectory >> How are you keeping up in toronto with this, with this growing demand? Well, it's not we're keeping up because there's incredible volunteers. There's a wonderful network of

agencies were responding to the call. But I got to tell you, rodger, the there is a growing sense of concern and a growing sense of frustration we have for year after year said there are clear policy alternatives that need to be implemented. Policies like the canada disability where if we, you know, just invested in that type of a program. We have the possibility of lifting up about a million and half canadians out of into a situation where they might thriving community. We know the policy solutions, we just need to have the governments at all levels have the fortitude and courage be able to implement them. And how would that work? That policy changes like to see. >> Well, yeah, I mean, when it comes to the canada disability benefit, we were very hopeful that it would be fully funded, meaning that somebody who currently is on disability in ontario, they receive about $1300 federally. There is to be a better $1000 top up to that. So they could at least be at the poverty the I was pleased to see in the federal budget, the re emphasis on affordable housing. So making sure that we are back building affordable housing and making sure that their rent supplements in place. And then I think provincially there are a whole host of measures to to start to decrease precarious employment to many people come to the food bank have full-time working, but are unable to have that allow them to be able to thriving community. We talk about the government helping out what the private sector do. >> Well, I think the private sector in a more often than not looking to to making sure that they are paying living wages. So not just minimum wage, but living wages so that their employees can have a decent place to live in the community that they're, they're working. You're right, it's not just a full exercise, but they ultimately have a duty of care to make sure that everybody's right to housing and everybody's right to food is realized so that food banks like the daily bread, food bank and food banks, canada all across the country can start to see the lineups decrease rather than the trajectory that they're currently on. >> And I mean, I know you do what you focus on and which is one of the most expensive cities in the world. But this is also an issue in smaller towns and and smaller municipalities. >> Abs, absolutely. And they don't have the same supports that we might have in a in larger urban areas. I mean, you just have to look at what's on the screen right now, right across the country. We're seeing, you know, a lot of red, we're seeing, you know, seasoned ease across the country when it comes to investments in affordable housing, when it comes to making sure that people have that a decent incomes, making sure that we've got an economy that allows businesses to thrive so that they can pay those living wages. >> Ok neal, thank you very much for joining us today. Always appreciate it. Neil hetherington is the ceo of the daily bread food bank. We're also getting a better sense of how canadians feel about the state of grocery prices in canada. The majority believe costs at stores are still climbing. A new leger poll found 29% blame the ryman rising costs on grocery chains who they believe are attempting to increase their profit margins. Senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at dalhousie university. Sylvain charlebois says he's not surprised. >> People have less money to spend on too. And they feel they feel desperate. And so they're looking to blame something, someone and he's is seeing ad to the one component, the supply chain that most people understand is the grocery store. But food inflation is much more complicated than that. But I'm not surprised to see the anger. The collective anger from some people out there. >> The federal government has introduced a voluntary code of conduct for major grocers to trying to promote fairness and transparency in the industry. Canada's biggest grocer loblaw has signed on industry minister francois-philippe champagne says he is hopeful others will follow suit. >> Seeing that inflation is going down. Why we have in recent years with respect to loblaw signing on it's a step in the right we have been in touch with walmart and costco and I'm hopeful that he will sign and that's, you know, if you talk grocers of kind of one of the key step to stabilize prices in canada. So we're going to keep about what we're going to keep on working with that. But I'm hopeful that everyone in the >> And frustration over high grocery prices pumped prompted a boycott of loblaw own stores this month. Now organizers say the protest we'll go beyond may 1st. According to the organizers, people supporting the boycott want to keep the movement going a release as the boycotters find a focus on advocacy efforts in the months ahead. Emily johnson is one of the key organizers and says the boycott has been a uniting moment for community members.

>> Ideally, what we wanted to do was just raise awareness of the drastically increasing cost of groceries means, you know, the fact that we do have control and power as consumers we never imagined in a million years that we had today. You know, 80,000 members on our subreddit own and and that there are 20,000 members between should kochan are instagram, it's its and we're just incredibly surprised by the viral atf. It. >> Well, a lot has pushed back against criticism of the company, saying it's not responsible for higher food prices. The canadian grocery chain has been expanding its discount stores to accommodate for the higher prices. And a live look in london, 10 downing street where we're waiting to hear from british prime minister rishi sunak's. He will be delivering a statement outside that famous store there likely announcing a summer general election. We'll take you there live when the prime minister speaks. Norway, spain and ireland have announced their intention to formally recognize a palestinian state, a declaration that would take effect on tuesday spoken with a number of of the heaters and counterparts. >> I'm confident that for other countries will join us and taking this important step in the coming weeks. >> Leaders from the 3 countries say they hope the move brings new momentum toward a 2 state solution, adding it's not a decision against israel or in favour of hamas, but instead one in support of peace. Israel reacted angrily to the move, calling the decision distorted. >> Israel claims that this is a reward to hamas. And I suggested it is not a reward ice who has no interest in 2 states, has no interest in the continuation of israel's existence. It's, it's a reward to moderates in the palestinian authority who already cooperate with israel. >> Israel has now recalled its ambassadors to ireland, norway and spain and some of their envoys. Hamas, meantime, welcomed the news news and is calling on other nations to follow suit. Meanwhile, in rafah, food distribution has been suspended due to a lack of supplies and insecurity. That according to the united nations. Well, prime minister trudeau says he is sticking by house speaker greg fergus, despite another controversy. We have full confidence in rexburg fergus as a. >> As a speaker, that is a common says a, a independent minded leader. The was dealt with was addressed by the party and by the house leader. It was unfortunate mistake. >> The issue is an invitation to a quote, summer evening with greg fergus and also referenced reckless policies of the conservatives, both conservative and bloc mp's are calling on fergus to step down. Ctv news political commentator scott reid says he doesn't see the attacks on fergus stopping anytime soon. Greg fergus is never going to moment's peace as speaker, he will be under constant fire. The conservatives opposed him when he was a candidate for speaker. >> They have pounced on the stakes city is made and they've made it clear that even in instances like this, where the mistake wasn't really his, they're going to hold him to account. So I think you're going to see great for guests on the grill over and over and over again. >> Let's go back to london now, where british prime minister rishi sunak is making a statement. >> I stood behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building behind me. I told you that we faced a generation defining moment and that we as a society would not be judged by some government action. >> But by the small acts of kindness that we showed, one of us. You met that challenge. And then some and I have never been proud to be british. When I introduce the follows skate. I did so not because I saw rick country simply in need of desperate help, little bit. We want. But because ice or a country, his future hung in the balance. I could be bold interest in the 10's of millions of you at home, that you would rise to the moment or I could accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth, it was no choice at all. I have never and will never leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days. Ally and you do that because you've seen it. I was like did that. I will forever do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it's easy to forget the scale of what we've been through. We were hit by pandemic upended

normal life. Who would have thought that the government would have to tell us how many times a day we could leave odds. Then just as we were recovering from covid full return to europe. With putin's invasion of ukraine energy bill spiring. I came to office the bubble to restore economic stability economic stability is the bedrock of any future success. Whether that is rising wages and good jobs investment in our public services. All the defensive, the country. And because of all collective sacrifice and your homework. We have reached 2 major milestones in delivering that stability. Showing that when we work together, anything as possible. Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted. Outpacing germany, france and the united states. >> And this morning, it was confirmed that inflation is back to normal. This means that the pressure on price israelis and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and parties I set out on work. I recognize that it is not always been easy. Some of you with any just be starting to feel the benefit. And for some, it might still be hard. When you look at your bank balance. But this hold and economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The question now is how and who do you trust to time that foundation into a secure future for you, your family and our country. Is the moment for britain to choose its future. To decide whether we want to build on the progress we have made risk going back to square one with no plan and no certainty. And today I spoke with his majesty, the king to request the dissolution of parliament. The king has grown to this request. We will have a general election on the 4th of july. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold. Putin's russia is waging a brutal war in ukraine and will not stop there. If he succeeds. That war is also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the middle east. The forces of business to extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and a volatile society here at heart. China, it's looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a leading technology. And migration is being weaponized by a stall states threatened the integrity of our. These uncertain times cool for a clip. Lot bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has stopped. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children. I cannot and will not play. We have got everything right. No government. I'm proud of what we have achieved together. The bold actions we have taken. I'm confident about what we can do in the future. We've tackled inflation controlled at caldwell cuts taxes and increase the state pension by 900 pounds. We've reduced taxes on investment, can seize the opportunities of brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow the business. That record amounts of funding into our nhs and ensure it is now trading. The doctors in the U.S. says it needs in the decades to come. We've reformed education and our children. Now the best returns in the west. We parts always energy security and your family finances over environmental do in our approach. And that's their right. We fully funded an increase in defence spending to 2 and a half percent of gdp. We made a decision to invest more in local transport you actually use rather than endlessly plow more money into hs 2. We set out a comprehensive plan to reform our welfare system to make it fast for those who pay for it as well as those who need it. Immigration is finally coming down and we all stopping the boats with our one departments. We will ensure that the next generation gross out smoke-free. I hope that my work since I became prime minister. Shows that we have apply and all for pat to take bold action necessary for all countries to flourish. I stuck with that plan and always been honest with you about what is needed, even when that's been difficult. Because I'm guided by doing what is right for our country. Not what is easy. I can say the same thing for the labour party. Because I don't know what. And in truth. I don't think, you know, ina. And that's because they have to plan. There is no action. And as a result, the future can only be on site. And with that. On the 5th of july and the

customer on will be prime minister. He has shown time and time again that he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made to become lately that once he got the job. How can you know that he would do exactly the same thing if he were to become prime minister. If you don't have the conviction to stick to anything you say. If you don't have the courage to tell people what you want to do. And if you don't have a plan. How can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times. Over the next few weeks. I will fight for every vote I will on your trust. I will prove to you. Only a conservative government led by me. Will not put a hold and economic stability at risk. Can restore pride and confidence in our country. And with a clear plan and bold action will deliver a secure future for you. Your family and our united kingdom. >> And you've been watching british prime minister rishi sunak standing outside of 10 downing street to announce that there will be a general election on july 4th.

The victims include a 15-year-old and two others age 23 and 25. Cbc's reporter has more from montreal. >> Reporter: what police are essentially saying today is we know that it was about 15-16 people, who were part of this altercation. And the big piece of news that we have is that police are saying that it is not linked to gang violence. But that it is just a personal conflict between these people. But police are not really giving much more details than that. Which know this happened around 7:00 P.M. last night in montreal. But aside from that, they say they really are still investigating. They're trying to identify all the people who are at the scene. Trying to identify witnesses. Trying to get camera footage of the area. But they're still very much in the early stages of this investigation. And trying to figure out where to go from here. They say they have one or two suspects, but they say at this point, no one has been arrested. It's simply too early in the investigation. >> Natasha: cbc reporter in montreal. >>> The head of quebecor is calling on the federal government to intervene on the deal between loblaws. The owner says the deal would push the company out of loblaws stores. Cbc's janyce McGREGOR reports. >> Reporter: if you shopped in an loblaws-owned store, you may have seen the mobile shop kiosks. They're independent. They market themselves as not a affiliated with any telecom company. Saying they don't pick favorites. Saying they work for consumers in their promotional materials. As you say, they're located across canada. They are now accused by the head of quebecor of engaging in some behaviour to try to shutout certain carriers from those shops. Pierre carl palado's letter to industry minister champaign says he's become aware of a new deal that would see these stores in grocery stores only carry products from rogers and bell. They have worked together on a joint venture called glen tell. And in the future, it apparently will have a supply contract so that the mobile shop only includes their products and their services. We remember, of course, freedom mobile, the quebecor kind of brand of cell service, it has only been a part of video tron québec for the last year. It was previously part of shaw communications. Shaw had to divest, sell it off as part of its merger with rogers. The intent was for quebecor to run a forced national cell phone carrier. It made a equipment to keep prices low in western canada and ontario to expand its 5g infrastructure to give consumers more choice. But if they're going to be shutout of certain shops, palado's point is will that come to pass? The telecom shop tells cbc, it only accounts for 5% of the total sales of phones and cell phone plans in canada. It says because it has an only limited market presence, it doesn't think decisions it might make about, you know, its suppliers necessarily affects competition in the sector on a national scale. It says it does continue to offer a range of options to its customers. But, you know, the concern here is that that range has shrunk with this new deal. >> Natasha: so in palado's's letter he's directing the minister champaign. What actions could the federal government take? >> Reporter: what are the minister's powers and limitations? He was stopped on his way into the liberal's national caucus meeting on parliament hill this morning and here's what he had to say. >> That's a question for the competition bureau. A letter should be addressed to the competition bureau and as you know we give them the powers to fully conduct the ministry investigation. >> Reporter: are you saying you have no power? >> It's the competition that has the power. >> Reporter: it's impacted because the minister does not direct the investigations that the competition bureau might choose to undertake. It's possible -- >> Natasha: we're going to interrupt janyce and take you to london, england, where the

british prime minister is making an announcement. >> As I stand as your prime minister, I can't help to reflect my first proper introduction was over fours ago. I sat behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building. I told you we face a generation-defining moment and we as a society would not be judged as government action but the small acts of kindness we show one another. You met that challenge and then some. I have never been prouder to be british. When I introduced the following scheme, I did so not because I saw a country simply in need of desperate help. Albeit, we were. But because I saw a country whose future hung in the balance. I could be bold and trust in the tens of millions of you at home you could rise to the movement or accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth, it was no choice at all. I have never and will never leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days alone. And you know that because you've seen it. I will do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it's easy to forget the scale of what we've been through. We were hit by a pandemic that upended normal life. Who would have thought the government would tell us how many times a day we could leave our homes? Just as we were recovering from covid, war returned to europe with putin's war on ukraine sent your energy fills skyrocketing. I came to office to restore economic stability, the bedrock of future success. Whether that is rising wages and good jobs, investment in our public services, or the defence of the country. And because of our collective sacrifice and your hard work, we have reached two major milestones in delivering that stability. Showing that when we work together, anything is possible. Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted, out pacing germany, france and U.S. and this morning, it was confirmed inflation is back to normal. This means the pressure on prices is relieved and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and priorities I set out are working. I recognise that it's not always been easy. Some of you will only just be starting to feel the benefits. For some, it might still be hard when you look at your bank balance. But this hard-earned economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The question now is how and who do you trust to turn that foundation into a secure future for you, your family, and our country? Now, it's a moment for britain to choose its future. To decide whether we want to build on the progress we've made oris can going back to square one with no plan and no certainty. Earlier today, I spoke with his majesty the king to request the dissolution of parliament. The king granted this request and we will have the general election on the 4th of july. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold war. Putin's russia is waging a brutal war in ukraine and will not stop there if he succeeds. That war made it too clear the risk to our energy security. In the middle east, the forces of extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are ex-employeded by extremist who seek to undermine our values and define our society at home. China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead in technology. And migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times, call for a clear plan. And bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has that plan. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children. Now I cannot and will not play the we have got everything right. No government should. But I am proud of what we've achieved together. The bold actions we have taken, the confidence about what we can do in the future. We've tackled inflation, controlled debt, cut workers' taxes, and increased state pension by 900 pounds. We've reduced taxes on investments and seized the opportunity for brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow a business. But record amounts of funding into our N.H.S. ensure it's training the doctors and nurses it needs to the decades to come. We've reformed education in our

children and are now the best readers in the western world. We prioritized energy security and family finances over environmental dogma in our approach to net-zero. We fully funded increase in defence spending to 2.5% of G.D.P. we made a decision to invest more in local transport so you use rather than endlessly pile more money into H.S. 2. We set out a plan to reform welfare system to make it fair for those who pay for it and those who need it. Immigration, is finally coming down. We're stopping the boats with our rwanda partnership. And we will ensure that the next generation grows up smoke-free. I hope that my work since I became prime minister shows we have a plan and are prepared to take bold action necessary for our countries to flourish. I stopped with that plan and always been honest with you about what is needed even when that has been difficult because I'm guided by doing what is right for our country, not what is easy. I can't say the same thing for the labour party. Because I don't know what they offer. In truth, I don't think you know either. That's because they have no plan. There is no bold action. And as a result, a future can only be uncertain with them. On the 5th of july -- or I will be prime minister. He has shown time and again he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made once he became leader once you got the job, how do you know he won't do the same thing if he were to become prime minister? If you don't have the conviction to stick to anything you say, if you don't have the courage to tell people what you want to do, and if you don't have a plan, how can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times? Over the next few weeks, I will fight for every vote. I will earn your trust, and I will prove to you that only a conservative government, led by me, will not put our hard-earned economic stability at risk. Can restore pride and confidence in our country. And with a clear plan and bold action, will deliver a secure future for you, your family, and our united kingdom. >> Natasha: okay. Folks, we've been taking you live to a rainy london. And that was british prime minister rishi sunak confirming what many of us were keeping he would say. There's going to be a general election in the U.K. an election day is going to be on july 4th. Let's bring in cbc's julia chapman, who was watching alongside at our london bureau. Julia, it's such a british scene powering down on the prime minister. And very punk rock. I don't know if it was a coincidence or someone was trying to drown him out. A huge mood-setter. Tell us what we should anticipate. >> Reporter: it's the news we were anticipating. It's against the backdrop of protesters. Rishi sunak confirms there will be a U.K. general election on july 4th. He's taken the decision to go early when it comes to calling this election. He had a few more months until he would have been forced to do so. Five years into this parliament. So there is certainly now a big campaign gaining momentum in the next six weeks as rishi sunak tries to paint the conservative party as the party of stability and he pointed to some of what he sees as the party's achievements over the last few years. Indeed, the conservative party has been in power for 14 years. He's the fifth prime minister during that time to run the united kingdom. He talked about the furlough scheme that he oversaw when he was a chancellor, the country's finance minister, during the covid period. How it helped people who were out of work to stay afloat. He pointed to his policy of trying to phase out smoking, a policy moving through parliament and will have to be rushed through in order to be approved before this election. Polls put him 20 points behind the labour party. He took aim at labour. Saying he doesn't know what the party stands for and he doesn't think the electorate does either. The leader will spend the next

Meanwhile, Blue Capsule has signed a partnership agreement with the French Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission, from which it was spun off, for the development of its small modular reactor.

Thorizon - a spin-off from NRG, which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten - is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe molten salt reactor (MSR), targeted at large industrial customers and utilities. Thorizon aims to construct a pilot reactor system before 2035.

MSRs use molten fluoride salts as primary coolant, at low pressure. They may operate with epithermal or fast neutron spectrums, and with a variety of fuels. Much of the interest today in reviving the MSR concept relates to using thorium (to breed fissile uranium-233), where an initial source of fissile material such as plutonium-239 needs to be provided. There are a number of different MSR design concepts, and a number of interesting challenges in the commercialisation of many, especially with thorium.

The molten salt fuel adopted by Thorizon uses a combination of long-lived elements from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and thorium. The reactor will be able to recycle long-lived waste from existing nuclear facilities. The Thorizon One concept is unique in that the core is composed of a set of cartridges that is replaced every five to ten years. This, the company says, overcomes two molten salt design obstacles: material corrosion and handling of used fuel volumes.

Under the new agreement, EDF R&D will review Thorizon's neutronic core calculations and conduct scenario analyses to determine how the Thorizon One could help to close the fuel cycle in the European reactor fleet.

Thorizon said it will ""benefit from EDF's expertise as the French leader in electricity production, and in particular from the recognised skills of its R&D researchers"".

""The R&D team covers all disciplines from neutronics and fuel to safety and construction,"" said Bernard Salha, EDF R&D Director and EDF Group Chief Technical Officer. ""We are actively supporting several start-ups in the France 2030 programme. The cartridge-based approach of Thorizon is interesting and promising.""

""It is a pleasure to work with the EDF team which has more experience in nuclear than any company across the globe,"" added Thorizon CEO Kiki Lauwers. ""Thanks to EDF R&D, start-ups like us benefit from access to unique industry experts that can very quickly spot the strengths and areas for improvements in our design. We hope we can continue to work with the EDF R&D team on the realisation of our technology in the future. We believe all solutions are needed to empower the energy transition and the Thorizon One can be a great compliment to the existing and planned nuclear fleet.""

Horizon says its ambition is to develop an MSR that ""can be realised rapidly and smartly, is 'walk-away' safe, and takes a first step towards circularity by using long-lived nuclear waste as a fuel source"". The company aims to build a non-nuclear molten salt demonstrator in the short-term and finalise the detailed design to start building a first-of-a-kind Thorizon One reactor by 2030.

Decarbonising industry

Blue Capsule - a spin-off from France's Alternative Energies & Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) - has announced the signing of a partnership agreement with the CEA for the development of its small modular reactor (SMR) that will supply heat and power to industry.

Aix-en-Provence-based Blue Capsule is developing a sodium-cooled, high-temperature SMR which can provide 150 MW of heat at 700°C, along with high-temperature steam and electricity. The company aims to decarbonise industrial sites used for ammonia and soda ash production, with subterranean capsules co-located onsite, close to demand.

Under the new agreement - with financial support from French public investment bank Bpifrance - CEA's support for Blue Capsule will extend to fields such as equipment and components, materials, calculation codes and TRISO-based fuel.

""France's leadership in the fields of nuclear energy and low-carbon solutions is creating big opportunities for industry right across the country,"" said Blue Capsule's reactor architect Domnin Erard. ""And for Blue Capsule, collaboration with the French nuclear sector is front and centre of our strategy.

""This vital partnership with the CEA means that Blue Capsule benefits from world-class expertise across the board. It lays the foundations for our future industrial cooperation with the French nuclear supply chain, for manufacturing and assembling Blue Capsule units.

""It all comes down to cutting industrial CO2 emissions and of course the re-industrialisation of communities in France and beyond. For our part, we'll do everything we can to help achieve that objective.""

Blue Capsule is planning to build a proof-of-concept sodium loop and a non-nuclear prototype by 2030. The company's first-of-a-kind SMR is scheduled for construction by 2035 and is set to be built in France.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.1372549019607843,454689557,3,,

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

It has been broadcasting over private 5G for 10 hours per day since May 9, covering the Olympic torch's journey of 1,625 kilometres.

The footage has been shown on the dedicated france.tv PARIS 2024 channel. France Télévisions said it selected 5G for an ""entirely cloud-based audiovisual production"" for its ""reliable, compact, high-speed, and ultra-secure"" delivery, and to meet its ""commitment to energy and environmental conservation"".

The broadcaster is using a private 5G product, called a 'bubble' Dome, from French start-up Obvios; it has also worked with US-based broadcast technology company TVU Networks and France-based system integrator TDF Group, which handled technical aspects of the ""mobile units"" carrying the 5G cells, edge compute, and broadcast software.

Satellite operator Starlink is also involved, apparently. France Télévisions said the solution has avoided ""several dozen metric tons of CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods"" - by connecting a high-fidelity video stream on a lightweight mobile 5G setup to a central control room without trucking lots of equipment about.

The Dome unit can be deployed in the trunk of a car, said Obvios, and does away with ""heavy [and] costly resources"" (such as production vans and helicopters"") to cover events of this scale.

It stated: ""This minimalist device revolutionizes the way production teams work. Live feeds, multi-camera production, graphics management, commentary, audio mixing, intercommunication between teams, broadcasting: everything can be controlled remotely from the Paris headquarters of the French audiovisual group.""

Nicolas Dallery, vice president of marketing and sales at Obvios, said: ""Our private 5G connectivity bubble is robust and maintains a perfect signal on the move. It overcomes the problems of coverage and saturation of public networks. That's the strength of a private 5G network.""

Romuald Rat, director of TechLab and AI at France Télévisions, said: ""Through this collaboration... [we] are setting a new standard for the future - one that prioritizes innovation, sustainability and the power of cloud technology to produce closer to events and bring fans closer to the action.""",rcrwireless.com,news,RCR Wireless News,James Blackman,0.0980392156862746,454861665,3,https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Olympics.jpg,

Chinese universities have been gaining popularity among African students thanks to the offering of scholarships as well as China's growing reputation in technology and development.30 Therefore, as Figure 4 shows, China is the second-most popular destination for Africans seeking higher education abroad, with roughly 81,600 students; France is the most popular (126,300 students) and the United States is the third-most popular (48,300 students). However, China's immigration policy is much tighter than the policies in European and North American countries. Therefore, most Africans studying in China tend to return home upon the completion of their studies instead of staying abroad, significantly reducing the prospects of ""brain drain"" for Africa.

China-Africa educational institutions are also maintaining strong collaboration. Sixty-one Confucius Institutes and forty-eight programs have been established in forty-eight African countries as of 2021. Additionally, China has supported over thirty African universities to set up departments or programs to study Chinese language. Luban Workshops in Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa have provided Chinese-style vocational training to African technicians, even when international travel has been restricted due to the COVID pandemic. Conversely, universities in China have added new courses for African languages, such as Amharic, Malagasy, and Zulu. Furthermore, the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, announced in August 2023, has pledged to train 500 principals and high-calibre teachers of vocational colleges every year, as well as 10,000 technical personnel with both Chinese language and vocational skills for Africa. The number of cooperating Chinese and African universities will be increased from 20+20 to 50+50. However, there are occasionally reports about African students' complaints related to Chinese teachers' English proficiency, internship and employment opportunities, as well as administrative services. If the education quality does not improve, the quantitative growth in cooperating universities may not be sustainable.

Media and cultural exchanges between African countries and China have increased since the start of the pandemic, largely due to the use of digital technologies. The Chinese cable television operator StarTimes provided 13 million subscribers in Africa with programs in eleven languages as of November 2021. TikTok, cell phone maker Transsion, and other Chinese internet companies greatly boost the formation of Africa's mobile media sphere. Chinese and African entertainment industries have been deepening their collaboration as well, with the joint production and broadcasting of movies and television series. Two notable series, Welcome to Milele Village (2023) and Ebola Fighters (2021), depicted Chinese medical teams in Africa and gained popularity among Chinese audiences. Soccer players from Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, and Nigeria have joined clubs in China's Premier league and A-level league. Chinese tourists are now also interested in taking historical tours and immersing themselves in African culture, as well as exploring the country's natural landscape. A number of African countries, including most recently Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia, have been providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries to Chinese visitors to foster tourism. Echoing the movement, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has listed thirty-four African countries as destinations for group tours.

Conclusion

China's economic growth is slowing from the double digits of previous decades as policymakers steer the economy toward a more high-tech, consumption-oriented, and environmentally sustainable growth model with reduced exposure to geopolitical shocks. And this economic transition will increasingly have implications for China's international economic relations with the rest of the world. As discussed above, across the five domains of China's economic engagement with Africa -- trade, investment, fiscal stabilization, RMB internationalization, and people-to-people ties -- both strong continuities and changes are evident. But this engagement is not happening in a vacuum. Policy directions within African countries and third parties such as the United States will greatly shape how these changes in the China-Africa relationship continue to unfold.

The changing patterns of trade between African countries and China will be shaped by policies in both advanced economies and African countries themselves. Rising barriers to market access in advanced economies are likely to push African countries further into the embrace of China. Between 2021 and 2024, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has suspended a record eight African countries from the U.S. trade preference program, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Meanwhile, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which began its initial transitional phase in October 2023, could make it even more difficult for African manufacturers to export to the European market and reduce the continent's GDP by up to $25 billion. Although individual European countries like France seek to expand their trade with Anglophone African countries, for instance, and the United Kingdom recently signed a trade deal with Kenya, this may not be sufficient to offset the wide-ranging impacts of market-restricting policies like the CBAM. Furthermore, growing China-Africa trade volumes will continue to be characterized by trade deficits. To address these deficits, African countries need to make a concerted effort to diversify their exports to China. Important steps to take include implementing the AfCFTA to create regional value chains, utilizing trade preference programs particularly the green lanes initiative -- as Kenya and Namibia are doing -- to export semi-processed agriculture produce to China and emulating the Indonesian approach to pressure Chinese companies to invest in the refining and processing of minerals in African countries.

As Chinese investments in Africa shift from infrastructure-oriented projects toward industrialization-oriented projects, African policy responses and the ability of Western countries to fill infrastructure financing gaps will be crucial. Chinese FDI flows for processing and manufacturing in various sectors -- whether related to agriculture, minerals and metals, construction material, or apparel -- are contingent on requirements in the domestic business environment that are within the remit of African governments. Basic requirements include the availability of affordable and reliable electricity, good transportation networks, skilled local workers, security, and the ability to compel Chinese companies to enter into joint ventures with local African firms for technology transfer. Whether the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan can step into the space being vacated by Chinese policy banks to provide infrastructure financing in Africa is an open question. Implementation of the Lobito Corridor project, a signature initiative of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), will test the G7's commitment to the scaling up of infrastructure investments in Africa. Whether the United States continues to prioritize the PGII by ensuring the program's continuity or incorporating new infrastructure projects remains to be seen -- especially if a new U.S. administration comes into office in January 2025.

Expansion of China's rescue-lending efforts and internationalization of the RMB in Africa are significantly dependent on African countries' own demand for and uptake of these initiatives. Will a growing number of African countries look to China, as an alternative to the IMF, for emergency liquidity support as their ability to finance imports diminish due to fiscal crises? Will there be a growing appetite among African countries for more central bank currency swap lines with the PBOC, and will there be increased drawdowns of yuan reserves? As African countries struggle to find scarce foreign exchange resources to settle and invoice their trade, will they follow the trend among some Asian countries in using the RMB for their bilateral trade with China? The answer to these questions may lie largely in whether the United States and its allies in Europe will provide sufficient measures to support African countries to overcome the latest bout of debt distress and fiscal crises.

Finally, China's loosening of pandemic-era travel restrictions and the phenomenon of digitalization will accelerate the increasing trend of people-to-people exchanges with African countries in higher education, media, and culture. Developments in China's immigration policy will be important to track as it begins to roll out visa-free travel for a select number of European and Asian countries. The hardening of visa regimes in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Western countries will also be important to monitor, as it could affect these countries' historically robust people-to-people exchanges with African countries.

By introducing a fully automated storage and retrieval system, ABB has achieved 90 percent improvement in overall logistics efficiency at the factory. Eliminating manual handling has also reduced the time required for final assembly of packages by 30 percent. This improvement is critical since the process handles one piece every three minutes.

""We wanted to improve logistics at the Ossuccio site, while also enhancing the entire manufacturing process,"" said Mariafrancesca Madrigrano, General Manager of the ABB Measurement & Analytics factory in Ossuccio. ""We constantly strive for operational efficiency through innovation and are always looking for ways to better address customer needs and ensure customer satisfaction.""

The solution consists of two ABB OmniVance™ FlexBuffer™ systems connected by a conveyor, each one equipped with ABB robots to enable efficient order handling. FlexBuffer allows for easy transitions between buffering, storing and sequencing tasks. It excels in efficiently combining temporary storage and sequencing functions, giving it a competitive edge over traditional systems. The mixed item variant of the FlexBuffer enables the user to store a wide variety of box sizes, all being handled with the same robot gripper. Because of the dynamic racking positions all boxes are stored with minimal loss of space.

Adoption of the system has alleviated the physical strain associated with manually handling heavy boxes.

Adoption of the system has enhanced working conditions for operators, alleviating the physical strain associated with manually handling heavy boxes. In addition, the workforce was reallocated to other manufacturing areas that required additional manpower, giving the factory a greater flexibility during production peaks.

The ABB Ossuccio factory is specialized in the production of pressure transmitters that enable industrial companies around the world to measure, monitor, and control applied force. Key for both safety and efficiency, pressure measurement is fundamental in industrial digital transformation. The factory exports 90 percent of its production.

Just maybe you want to bolster what I was just saying, julia, what stood out to you as you listened to what the president was laying out there. >> Perhaps not a big surprise with the verdict but still a stark assessment of the situation in gaza, particularly since israel started its offensive in rafah. Just a couple of weeks ago. And the deterioration as the president of the international court was painting a picture of a very difficult situation in terms of the humanitarian conditions on the ground, and he was referencing particularly the facts that there had been evacuation orders issued in advance by israel, warning that it was going into rafah, that led to the displacement of some 800,000 people, according to the united nations. And what I think was interesting from this ruling was the fact that the judges found that that wasn't good enough, the fact that there had been advance warning. They said that the situation to where -- where the people had been moved to simply wasn't good enough, they were living without roofs, without water, without any kind of sanitary conditions, and of course very limited access to aid, which is why the icj has made its judgment that the rafah crossing needs to be reopened. We've been hearing major concerns about the fact that since israel took control of the gaza side of that crossing, there hasn't been any aid coming from egypt into gaza over the last couple of weeks. And although there are other routes and israel has insisted that it isn't blocking aid, that's been a major sticking point for aid groups where we heard the judges talking about the world food program, not having access to a warehouse in rafah as well. So a really stark picture of what's going on there, but, yes, the headlines effectively that the court is ordering israel to halt its rafah offensive, open the rafah crossing and allow investigators in to ensure that israel is complying with an order from earlier in the year by the icj that it meets to prevent a genocide in gaza. >> Heather: just again, getting a little bit of context to all of this, again, ordering the stop to the rafah incursion, some had expected the icj could go even further and order a stop to the entire wars the entire offensive in gaza broadly, that has not happened, nor did it happen with the initial ruling back in january. So this is rafah specific. Interesting that the votes in all of these were 13-2, and the american representative on the international court who's a justice by the name of sarah haul cleveland, she voted were the majority, so she voted in favour of these provisional measures. In terms of the southwestern ontario come of this, this is legally bind bug there is no power to enforce these orders from the international court of justice. By way of understanding, this is brought by south africa, it's part of the larger case, south africa alleges that israel has been involved in acts of genocide. It filed that back last december and this is part of what's making its way through the international court of justice. The main case which deals with that main accusation of genocide it's not expected to start until next we are. Israel has of course denied the case, but this is part of that within what is being investigated and that's part of the, as you said, julia, must be open to any investigators lookings at some of these allegations and looking for evidence. So this is the context to the ruling today. We already know, again, not able to be enforced, israel has already made it clear it will nod adhere to this, whatever it was going to be. No power on earth will stop israel from protecting its citizens and going after hamas in gaza. That's what a government spokesperson has already said. So what is this likely to lead to, as far as israel's response, and I would also like you to look, julia, if you could, to how the world will respond, the kind of isolation, the kind of criticism that we may hear as a result of what the icj has just ruled. >> Well, absolutely. I mean, israel did defend itself at the court last week because it is a member of the united nations and it has to effectively put forward its rebuttal to the south african allegations, so certainly it has been participating in these proceedings and although they are legally binding, as you say, incredibly difficult to enforce on the ground, south africa continuing to press israel on its actions in gaza and although the broader genocide case could take many years, it wants to see pressure put on israel at every stage, particularly as the situation on the ground is evolving. Certainly, we have seen israel already dismiss international courts' efforts to intervene in gaza, saying that israel didn't start this war, it didn't want this war, and it needs to carry out its offensive, it says, in rafah because it's -- the last stronghold of hamas. It says that's necessary to route out hammond every hamas.

certainly that has been its perspective, and although it will be difficult to enforce this, there does add to a growing sense of pressure and isolation on israel, there have been many countries expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza and specifically about the situation in rafah as well which the united states warned against this offensive, although we heard a couple of days ago that the U.S. said no red lines had been crossed there so far. But it does certainly -- verdicts like this, judgments like the icj's judgment today do add to that pressure and help shape the international response, for example, in russia when the icj ruled that its invasion of ukraine was unlawful, that certainly added some legal weight to many countries giving weapons to ukraine. So that is the kind of picture we are expecting going forward there. Could be stronger responses from western countries as this situation in gaza continues. >> We already had, as you and I were talking about, the three countries, spain, ireland and norway going ahead to declare that they will declare an official palestinian state as of next week. Again, as part of this international pressure and growing international condemnation. Julia, thank you. I will let you go for now. Julia chapman going to continue watching the story out of our bureau in london. And as we return to the scenes outside, we do see a small group of pro-palestinian demonstrators. We would expect reaction to come to this judgment from the international court of justice. What we've seen previously is the lawyers for south africa will respond and also the legal team for israel as well. But julia raises a number of questions, what will come of all of this? Will there be suddenly today or increasingly international condemnation? Will any countries go to the point of new sanctions and will there be, as some have been concerned about from the israeli perspective, will this then lead the united nations security council to declare some new form of declaration which would then require the united states to use its veto power in support of israel in all of this? There are many diplomatic and political repercussions to come even if there is no power to enforce this decision just out from the international court of justice.

The icj has ordered israel to keep the rafah border crossing open, to allow investigators access to the gaza territory, and to report back on the measures israel has taken in one month's time. This is all in response to a request from south africa for a cease-fire, the court's ruling is legally binding, but the icj cannot enforce it and israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. >> Outrage over the war in gaza continues to spark strong reaction and protest in this country. A pro-palestinian encampment at the university of toronto's main campus has just over six hours left to respond to the school's latest bid to end the demonstration. Meagan fitzpatrick is on campus today. >> The university publicly released the offer that has been presented to students at around :30 yesterday. So it outlines the proposed responses to the protesters' demands. When it comes to the students' demands around u of t divesting from companies that support the israeli military, that's one of the demands of the students, not to have any university money invested in those kinds of companies, the university is proposing to set up an advisory committee to do a review of the university's investments, essentially and that advisory committee would be made up of students and staff and faculty and alumni and they are saying representatives from the encampment can suggest membership on that committee and that committee would be asked to report back to the president by no later than the end of october. Also on the students' demand for more disclosure around the university's investments, the school is proposing to set up a working group to look at that, looking at ways of increasing transparency around investments, and that group would be asked to report back by mid july. On the protesters' demand around u of t cutting academic ties with some israeli institutions, the university on that point is essentially saying that's a no go, that the university rejects that demand, saying they will not terminate any partnerships with israeli universities or engage in any academic boycotts. They say they will continue to look at ways of increasing opportunities for palestinian scholars here at the university of toronto. So those are sort of the bare bones of some of the offer that the school is presenting to the protesters. In terms of the timing & this offer now, here's a bit of what the u of. It's president merrick gardener said about that. >> It's also clear that many members of our community feel increasing distress by the presence of the encampment. They feel unsafe, they have reported feelings of -- and experience of discrimination and harassment, we have also had reports of hateful speech and hateful acts which we have reported promptly to toronto police service. After hearing these complaints of our community and after recognizing how long the use of this space has been denied to other members of our community, we felt now is the time to act.

>>> My apologies, that's merrick gertner, not garden temple in he said the offer presented to the student is conditional on them clearing the encampment, not setting it up anywhere else on campus and letting convocation ceremonies proceed uninterrupted. That first convocation ceremony set to be held on june 3rd, right over there. And the president saying those ceremonies will go ahead regardless of whether the students accept this offer. >> That is meagan fitzpatrick on campus at u of t this morning. >> There is breaking news just now from canadian border and customs officers, that they could go on strike as early as next month. In a release just out this morning, their union says workers with cbsa, canada border service agency have voted the 6% in favour of job action. Now, there's no strike date yet, but their union expects to be in an illegal strike position in early june. 90% of border officers are considered essential can't can't walk off the job but it could cause delays for travellers at border crossing as and at airports of course right at the time of the busy holiday season.

Also ordering israel to keep the rafah border crossing open for basic supplies for humanitarian aid, to allow investigators access to the territory in gaza to investigate what is at the basis of the south african allegation of genocide, and report back on all measures israel has taken in a month. Those are the four key points from the decision you saw live on cbc morning live, this is all in request for south africa's request for a cease-fire. The ruling is legally binding, the icj cannot enforce it. Israel has already indicated it will not respect the court's decision. Now, we're looking here at live pictures outside the building known as the peace palace, this is the icj, the international court of justice, and we do expect to see as we've seen in past moments on this case lawyers from both sides on the steps of the courthouse responding to the icj decision. We will have that for you live just as soon as we see. As far as reaction, we are just

hearing through reuters from, palestinian authority, here is the statement from the palestinian authority, welcoming the icj decision and saying it represents, quote, an international consensus to end israel's war on gaza. That again from the palestinian presidency, a spokesperson to the reuters news agency. And we will continue to bring you reaction, there is just some reaction and now again to reuters from israel's finance minister, saying that after this ruling, those who demand that israel stop the war are demanding that it should decide to cease to exist, israel will not agree to that. That gives you a sense of the kind of reaction we will see from both sides to come. So we will watch that story very closely through the day here on cbc news network, and just before we go, let's touch base one more time with chris murphy and our forecast heading into the weekend, race weekend in ottawa, all sorts of activities outdoors, all across the country, chris, have a good one. >> Thank you, you too, heather, yeah, big travel weekend in the states, memorial day weekend and again from the upper midwest right down to the southern plains, severe weather there. We've got rain on the north side of our low pressure system. This is the biggest weather maker for today, certainly, in southern manitoba, where we could be looking at more than 50 millimeters worth of rain by the time it ends tomorrow. This is a slow-moving system and locally heavy bands of rain and it's a cold rain, 4° in brandon, 10 in winnipeg, and you will be lucky if you see 10 and we could be getting into wet snow towards riding and turtle and duck mountain, those kind of parts, a little higher elevation. Over towards southern alberta and southern british columbia, another day where we can get some more showers and thunderstorms. Medicine hat has had 110 millimeters of rain so far in may. That is more than double what you would normally get. We could get more thunderstorms there. So there's your heavy rain and wet snow lifting northward, so by tomorrow afternoon, that rain is winding down in the south. More scattered showers and likely thunderstorms into the bc interior and for the south coast, you've got some scattered showers, for the next few days and below seasonal values as well. So the west is getting some beneficial rain, although when you start talking about 50-plus millimeters, we're talking tractors getting stuck in the field. So that's not necessarily good news. But overall, this moisture pattern in the west has been what we needed. Just wish we could get a little bit further north, scattered thunderstorms as mentioned possible, 5 to 15 millimeters of rain for the west coast and this again, portions today, tomorrow, and then there will be more additional rain sunday with those cooler temperatures. Beautiful day in much of the lower great lakes, st. Lawrence river, very warm in the maritimes. Now, keep an eye on your northwest sky because we've got the cold front coming in, so scattered thunderstorms along were it, northwestern new brunswick mid afternoon spreads its way southeastwards through the late afternoon and evening hours, not everybody's going to get a storm, but at this point, we think below severe warning criteria, and there's going to be a chance overnight tonight that southwestern ontario could get a couple of nocturnal storms. That will spread their way eastwards tomorrow, but it's not an all day event saturday. >> The weather update is brought to you by the ""off! Cast"" mosquito forecast.

We begin with breaking news on the israel-hamas war and a ruling just out from the international court of justice in the hague. The judges at the icj had reaffirmed earlier orders in a case brought by south africa, and today they have ordered israel to halt its offensive in rafah. Israel has been ordered to reopen the rafah border crossing to give investigators access and to allow for the flow of aid and humanitarian investors. >> Israel must halt its military actions and any other actions which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza or conditions of life that could bring about the significant destruction. >> A reporter is just outside the court in the hague where that ruling came down. Alex, what can you tell us about the ruling and the potential impact? >> Certainly this ruling we expect would send a clear message and it has done that. The court ordering israel to cease all military operations in rafah. And explaining some of the logic behind that decision. They say the humanitarian situation in rafah can be seen as disastrous, and they are not convinced that israel has put enough in place to cater to that humanitarian support, or to allow for the safe evacuation of civilians. Two fold measures, one, the stopping of all military operations in rafah, and to allow for the axis of the united nations fact-finding mission in rafah as well. Clearly a message from the world court that israel has to do more, must do more, and that things have not approved -- improved since they last ordered israel to do so. Now the bigger question is a bit more complicated. Although these are legally binding orders they are not legally enforceable. The international court of justice says that palestine does not have a police force to enforce these orders. What they can do, or what the un can do is have the security council pass resolutions to sanction israel, force embargoes on israel and have enforcement actions on these orders, but those can be vetoed by the united states. So crucially the relationship between israel and washington dc is not crucial going forward. >> Reporter: as you are speaking, alex -- alex, allegedly hamas has issued a statement, saying that they are urging the security council to implement the icj ruling. Let us move away from the icj for a moment and turn to the icc, where the lead prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant for the israeli prime minister and other top israeli officials, as other -- as well as other members of hamas leadership. Let us talk about the increasing international pressure, presumably, where you are as well, we can hear that screaming, and all the pressure on israel? >> Certainly diplomatic pressure, we have heard spain, ireland and norway saying in a matter of days they will recognize palestinian states. Slovenia and belgium and others should follow suit. But crucially germany and france say the conditions have not been met to recognize palestine as a state, and that remains a big issue. The international criminal court requestinghose arrest warrants , and that decision will be made in a couple of months. That would mean that prime minister netanyahu, defence minister gallant, would not be able to travel to 124 countries around the world, including canada and most of the european union states as well for fear of being arrested. Now also the leadership of hamas , the leaders of hamas who organized the atrocities of october seventh are as well subject to those arrest warrants. But you are right to say that there is a building diplomatic pressure. Perhaps one difference is the new dutch government that will be formed in the next few days, and they seem to be more supportive of israel than the previous one. Globally speaking, more pressure on israel to do more, but there are se excepti >> Natasha: alex caddy eight, at the hague. Thank you. Let us get closer to the actual war. Let us go to gaza, where the israeli army says they have retrieved the bodies of three more hostages killed during the october 7th attack by hamas militants. The military says the recovery was part of a special operation in northern gaza which had seen erce fighting in recent days. Irris makler joins us now from jerusalem. She is tracking not part of the story. What do we know at this stage?

The air strike came just hours after hamas fired a barrage of rockets from gaza into israel. No injuries reported. There.

Peel regional police unveiling today result of a major auto theft investigation. We'll tell you more about project odyssey in moments. It is 4:00 24 degrees from 299 queen street west. This is toronto's breaking news cp24. Hello. I'm melissa duggan. Our top story right now. Pro-palestinian protesters, are joined by labour unions, faculty and staff as they defy a trespass order to leave king's college circle. Cp24's lindsay biscaia is at u of t with the latest and lindsay on a day where we've seen so much rain, any signs of protesters leaving. >> Not at all, melissa. But I mean, I would say not this morning. You know, we saw, as you say, so much rain, just absolutely pouring this morning. And it did not dampen the spirits of protesters. They have not started dismantling the encampment. You can see it in full force behind me. And more than that, they came out for a rally this morning to show solidarity for the people of palestine as well as people in this encampment. Despite all of that rain. So now as you mentioned, the latest is that the university is going to

file an injunction to have the protesters evicted from the university's property. But once you file an injunction takes 24 to 48 hours to schedule a court date. So we're still waiting to hear more on what the status is there. But we do have a statement from the university was issued to us a couple of hours ago, all read it for you. Now it says in part, the notice of motion is proceeding normally and will be accessible through the usual process once it is filed at the court at 3.30 university avenue. We continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment and hope they will bring the act unauthorized encampment to a peaceful. And the students here say that they have a couple demands 3 actually specific demands that they wanted the university to meet. So far, the university has not met those demands. And that is why they're not leaving. But we did also hear from a number of the encampment, one of the organizers today on that and and her thoughts on, you know, what's happening right now with the university and why they don't feel negotiations are going well, have a listen. >> My all of this, despite all the horrors and atrocities we're seeing every single day last 234 days, ut continues to tell us they cannot make commitments. And that we must go through a bureaucratic committees committees that will lead us nowhere. But we do not have time for committees. We do not have time to wait. >> So at this point, most important to note as well, negotiations between the university and students are continuing. This started last night at 5:00pm and we heard from erin mackey, she said that, you know, the demands were proposed again by the students and the school wanted to another day to look over the demands. And so those negotiations are going to continue tonight, starting at 5:00pm. So maybe there will be some kind of peaceful resolution here, but we're also waiting for that injunction to be filed as well. So we'll have to wait and see what happens. A lot of things still at play. But yes, as of today, this is day 25 and encampments remains here at u of t let's and a busy day for you. Lindsay developments coming in throughout the day. We'll check in with you a little bit later on. Thanks again. >> A university in montreal has been granted a partial injunction against pro-palestinian demonstrators, who set up an encampment of their own on its campus.

Protestors have been banned from setting up tents within 2 metres of school buildings and they've also been ordered to keep doors and windows and walls clear of obstructions and allowed the fire department to inspect the site. The school argued the protesters posed a safety risk by blocking emergency exit and storing gas in the campus. There was a show of support today for a north york, a jewish girls school that was hit by gunfire over the weekend. Mayor olivia chow and police chief myron demkiw were among those who attended a solidarity rally this morning at the moose kellam entry school near dufferin and finch. Police responded to a call for shots fired at the school early saturday morning and found a bullet hole in the building. No one was hurt. Organizers, they say today's demonstration was meant to show the school students, staff and families that the community stands with them. >> I'm here to stand with you to say that anti-semitism, it's like cancer. We have to say no. It erodes the boss of empathy and compassion between people. Is saying no to decay over so side into hate and is out and absolutely have no place in toronto. >> Police have said it's too early to determine if the shooting is a hate crime or if it's an act of terrorism. But they note the hate crime unit is supporting this investigation. Residents in some neighbourhoods have been told to expect an increased police presence. It is 4:06. 24 degrees time for look at the so things over to adwoa. Well, yeah, has been a quite the a busy afternoon. Listen, if you are making your way out be putting on the brakes. >> On the northbound lanes of the 427, the do start just north of the gardiner in the collectors and they do continue all the way up towards dundas. That's because this collision that continues in the collectors that is blocking the 2 right lanes elsewhere are travelling on the eastbound 4, some good news.

A 16 year-old is dead after a shooting in the east end. >> Live now to cp24 crime and winless on the scene with the very latest. Steve, what do we know so far here? >> Mostly we know according to a toronto police to the latest homicide here in the sea happened just after 1:00 this morning. Cataraqui crescent is the location. It's the house behind me here we can have a look. It's near warden avenue in scarborough. Police say that they attended this location at 1:00 regarding a shooting. They arrived on scene, they found a young male, a 16 year-old who had been shot. He was rushed to a hospital life-threatening condition. And sadly, he died as a result of his injuries. So that homicide squad is now taking over this investigation. The forensics team has been on all day, several uniforms in the areas while canvassing the area looking for witnesses or anybody who has information pertaining to the shooting. The 6 year-old boy has been identified by police as jamal at U.S. 16 years old to from toronto. And we're not sure right now what the motive is, what the relationship is between the deceased and the suspect. In fact, we have no suspect information right now. I am expecting probably with an update once they get this investigation rolling, as time passes on, they will get more information pertaining to a suspect. And there is a lot of very good video surveillance around area as well. So I would suspect some point in time if the shooting happened inside. Inside the which has been reported. We might get the suspect leaving this location, but that will come in due course right now. The police continue to collect that information and they're looking for witnesses. So if you are in the area here on cataraqui near warden, 1:00 this spring or if you something that you thought to be suspicious, you're being asked to give the police a call. >> 16 years old to tragic story there. Thanks for that. Steve. >> Peel police say they have busted a highly orchestrated auto theft ring that they have dubbed project odyssey. >> Cp24's andrew brennan is here for more on this operation.

And also 16 people charged 322 charges laid that are from the criminal code. A lot some of the suspects that police have brought forward saying that they were already out on bail at the time. They were picked up 4 auto theft. Now when we have heard for not only from the lead detective today on what was as a part of project odyssey, but also from some of the mayors in the gta, particularly in brampton. A mississauga was heard from brampton's mayor patrick brown today, where it's been a noticeable problem. We've been seeing year-over-year increases in the number of not only violent carjackings, but auto thefts overall about this problem is one that is clearly not going away now. But this is a significant dent, it seems in organized crime trying to get these vehicles largely luxury vehicles out of the gta and on to ships out of the country. Take a listen. As a result of our investigation, we have recovered 369 vehicles. >> We seized 3 transport trucks and 2 stolen bobcats. What we're being facilitated at the yard and those items have been seized as offence related property. A total of 33.2 million dollars was recovered in stolen vehicles before it was destined out of the country. >> Auto theft crisis is a national crisis. It is the numbers are staggering.

Now, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu says the strikes on rafah that killed dozens of civilians. They were a tragic mistake, adding that investigation is underway for the latest on the israel-hamas war. We're joined now by ctv's colton praill colton. What's the latest here? >> Well, it's it's a rare admission to hear from the israeli prime minister that this was not what they had intended. The idf has said previous intelligence that they had suggested that there would be no civilian harm from the strike at this encampment just outside of rafah. Instead, data from the gaza ministry of health says 45 people dead nearly 250 injured in those numbers may still climb. It's a stark contrast to what israel was expecting and to see the israeli prime minister stand up in his parliament and say that this was a mistake. This wasn't intended. Speaks to the amount of international pressure and domestic pressure that he is currently facing. We have seen the protests happening in jerusalem across israel from the families of those who families of the hostages. The immense pressure internally on benjamin netanyahu to free those. But we're also seeing in light of friday's decision from the international court of justice ordering all hopes to the offence in rafah. Much more international pressure specifically in the, in offence, in this area in relation to what we saw happen on sunday. The reason for the decision from the icj on friday were fears that any sort of military operation wouldn't be able to properly provide enough safety for the 800,000 plus civilians who were in rafah. This after about 800,000 people have already evacuated the area. And so to see this level of civilian casualties in the strike. One of the first significant strikes since that decision, it's led to immense international, a poor countries like spain floating the possibilities of possible sanctions on israel as a result of this. And the continued defiance of that icj order. We've heard from the un high commission are calling it a horrific attack. But it was an entirely predictable outcome, saying that there appears to be no change into the means or method of warfare

(Upbeat music) (Dynamic instrumental music) It's been estimated that at least a third of used cars for sale are misrepresented, have liens or are stolen. With police cracking down on gangs stealing cars for export, many criminals are now selling cars locally. To do this, they're swapping vehicle identification numbers with wrecked vehicles or using phony vin plates and documentation copied from vehicles for sale in other jurisdictions. If you're stuck with one of these, it is subject to seizure and your insurance won't cover it. The best way to protect your rights is to buy a used car from a licensed omvic registered car dealer that way you will have recourse if the vehicle turns out to be misrepresented, have liens or it's stolen.

Welton played 10 seasons in the nba from 1974 to 1987 with the trail blazers clippers and the celtics. He was named mvp in 1978 after his playing days, he went on to become an nba analyst and commentator bill walton was 71 years old. Nba commissioner adam silver released a statement highlighting walton's outstanding career. It goes on to read. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events. Always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. A treasured. I treasured our close friendship. Envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered as a cherished member of the nba family. For 50 years, bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. It's a lovely tribute. There it is to 55 on this monday. And 22 degrees, this is toronto's breaking news cp24. The 8:00am trespass deadline has come and gone and there are still no signs of the pro-palestinian. Demonstrators will dismantle

israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu says the strikes on rafah that killed dozens of civilians were a tragic mistake, adding that an investigation is now underway for the latest on the israel-hamas war and these developments. We're now joined by ctv nationals colton praill colton. Tell us more about those comments and this investigation. >> We know it speaks to the immense international pressure. The israel is under for prime minister benjamin netanyahu to stand up in front of the israeli parliament and make that admission that this was a tragic mistake. Really is something that we don't see very frequently. And it speaks to discrepancy between how the idf described this attack and what actually idf previously said they were under the impression or their intelligence suggested there would be no harm to civilians. They were targeting 2 senior hamas commanders with what they called a purse ice strike. But what actually ended up occurring was devastation was a fire in a tent encampments from the gaza ministry of health. We have data 45 people dead, at least more than 200 injured. Those numbers could continue to rise. It's important to note that does come from the hamas-run authority, but it speaks to the level of devastation that occurred in this area. And it happened just days after an international court ordered israel to halt its offensive in the area on grounds that any military operations would be too dangerous to civilians. And as a result of that order and a result of what happened on sunday. We're seeing immense international pressure from countries like spain who are threatening potential sanctions on israel if they continue their assault in rafah. Countries like france, who have said that this is outrageous and that they are specifically calling on israel to adhere to those court orders. We've also heard from the high commissioner of the un himself who not only called this horrific, but said it was an entirely predictable outcome. And israel and particularly prime minister benjamin netanyahu faces more pressure internally from the families of hostages who have yet to be released. He is also facing this new added external pressure. And it comes just a day before we're going to see a number of other states officially recognize palestine. And so for him to come out and admit that this was a tragic mistake and that something in the process went wrong. Speaks to the pressure he's feeling, but also the political aspect of trying to continue an assault in rafah, trying to stick to their guns in if pardon the pun and try to seek out those last few bastions of hamas soldiers, while also dealing with potential international consequences from countries who previously would have been viewed as israeli allies and are now becoming a little more full-throated, a little more open and they're admonishments of certain aspects of this conflict. Alright, ctv's colton praill reporting live. Thanks so much, colton. And for a closer look at >> What's happening in this country. We can tell you the foreign affairs minister, melanie joly, she was grilled by the ndp in the house of commons in the last hour after this latest attack on rafah. >> Women and children were burned alive. Intense. They were told they were in a safe zone in a refugee encampment, yet they were burned alive. What will it take for this liberal government to send a message to netanyahu the what, as opp and is inexcusable. For this government to take actions to prevent this genocide from happening. >> Even in times of wars. And the images coming out of rafah are horrific. Our position has been to and we've been saying it now for weeks. Palestinian civilians do not have any say space to go. The killing of innocent civilians is completely unacceptable. And decisions of the international court of justice are binding the level of human suffering is catastrophic. And that's why mister speaker, we need immediate cease-fire. >> And closer to home here in this city, pro-palestinian protesters were joined by labour unions, faculty and steph is they defied a trespass order to leave king's college circle. They say their needs have not been met. Cp24's lindsay biscaia is at the u of t with the very latest. And I guess negotiations with the school continue. Lindsay. >> Yeah, those negotiations leno will be continuing about 2 hours another supposed to pick up again around 5:00pm this evening. In the meantime, you can see this encampment behind me still very much in protesters have said there would not be dismantling this encampment until the university has matched their demands, which it has not done yet. So we do have the latest from the university is that

after that deadline came and went this morning that trespassing deadline. The university is now filing court injunction to a protesters. And we did get a statement from the university. Earlier today on the model. We part of that for you now it says the notice of motion is proceeding normally and will be accessible through the usual process once it's filed at the court at 3.30 university avenue. We continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment. >> And hope they will bring the authorized encampment too. A peaceful end. And we've also spoken with students who are in this encampment, protestors about those negotiations and what they're hoping for from the university. Here's more on that. >> It's the 3 main demands that remain. Since thursday, when we received the first written offer the ut we sent a counteroffer right kind of senior demands, what our lines are, what we're actually interested in seeing. And so we presented that to them at the meeting and then they spent, you know, what our trying to caucus and figure out, you know, their next steps and you know, we kind of have to see what happens again. Billy, the ball's in their court right? Students are here, they will continue to be here. They will and meant despite the threats of police, despite the threats of academic, the precautions. >> So we'll have to wait and see how this all pans out. Li na at this point, the university has said it will not meet several demands, including cutting ties with israeli universities. Are maybe with these negotiations, we can come to some kind of a peaceful otherwise that notice of injunction will be filed by the university. >> You all right, lindsay biscaia reporting live. Thanks so much. Lindsay. >> And there is a show of support today for a north york jewish girls school that was hit by gunfire over the weekend. Mayor olivia chow and police chief myron demkiw are among those who attended a solidarity rally this morning at the bay entry school near dufferin and finch. Police responded to a call for shots fired at the school early saturday morning and found a bullet hole in the building. Organizers say today's demonstration was meant to show the skuce school students, staff and families that the community stands with them. >> We were able to the suspects driving up on the street right here, parking right here across the street from where we are right now. They came up the defence and fired shots and they had people waiting for them in the car and then they drove grateful to the federal government. Got us grant a couple years back. Stole the security fence that you see here, which enabled us to have close and they only have to stand behind a fence and they were unable to get onto the property. >> You and your families. >> Have a right to. I came here to tell you you're not alone. We came to say doesn't that is important. That we come together. I know jury community is resilient, is powerful. In canada and in toronto. There's no place for hate. >> Incredibly concerned, we've seen a growing rising anti-semitism since october 7th, but we haven't seen something like we've seen this weekend, shooting of this institution right behind me. And we really feel this is not just an attack on this wonderful school. But in talking entire community. And if you look at the stats right now, it was person living in toronto is 5 times more likely to be the victim of an anti-semitic hate crime. Accused person living in new york city. This is the city that we all love. This is very scary and it's dangerous, not just for our jewish community dangerous for the kind of city we all want to live in. >> Police have said it's too early to determine if the shooting as a hate crime or act of terrorism, but noted the hate crime unit is supporting the investigation. No one was injured at the school. Residents in some neighbourhoods have been told to expect an increased police presence. Time now is 3 10 sitting at 22 degrees. Early. Look at the roads this afternoon. We turn to traffic specialist adwoa good afternoon to good afternoon, lee. 90, it has been an easy afternoon, at least seeing a little bit of sunshine poke through the clouds, but that's for the good news ends. If you're commuter. >> You're running into a problem on the eastbound of one in the express to red fort crews on scene of a collision that does have the 2 left lanes occupied. Then on the flip side, westbound 401. The st. James snow parkway ongoing collision, only a couple of vehicles and a truck does have that left lane blocked problems to deal with on the northbound for 27 gems in the collectors through dundas. This is because of the collision that is now blocking the 2 right lanes collision that a deal was on the eastbound lanes of the gardiner of this is that just on the approach to jamieson centre lane occupied then westbound on the gardiner trying to get out of downtown by those westbound lanes. It's the left lane blocked out following the collision and more issues on the qew

Also problems outside of camera view eastbound 4, 1, at highway 6 north ongoing collision from this morning. The cleanup continues in the 2 right lanes are occupied leena. I'll send it back to thank you. Adwoa. A 16 year-old is dead after a shooting in the east end. Police. >> Were called to warden road avenue, rather and cataract. He crescent, which is north of danforth road. They say a male youth was shot around 1:00am inside his residence. He was rushed to hospital by paramedics, but pronounced dead. He has been identified as jamal abdi nassar of toronto. There's no information on potential suspects, anybody with information is asked to call police or crime stoppers peel. Police say they have busted a highly orchestrated auto theft ring. Investigators say they seized more than 300 stolen vehicles as part of an operation dubbed project odyssey. The recovered vehicles have a combined value of more than 33 million dollars. Some of the vehicles were taken during during violent carjackings. Police allege a local trucking company was facilitating shipments of stolen vehicles to the port of montreal, where they were to be exported to the middle east. >> As a result of our investigation, we have recovered 369 vehicles. We seized 3 transport trucks and 2 stolen bobcats. What we're being facilitated at the yard and those items have been seized as offence related property. A total of 33.2 million dollars was recovered in stolen vehicles before it was destined out of the country. >> Auto theft crisis is a national crisis. It is the numbers are staggering. Across ontario and quebec record auto thefts. This has been the biggest gift organized crime in canadian history. 1.2 billion in 2022. The 23 numbers are coming in to maybe 2 billion to organized crime for international auto theft. But today's a bit of a the police did some great investigative work. We have the largest auto thefts commercial unit in canada in peel region and we arrest people in peel region. We take on difficult investigations and hold them accountable. >> 16 people have been arrested in connection with the investigation and arrest warrants have been issued for another 10. Police say 14 of the suspects identified in the probe were out on a form of release or bail for auto theft related offences. More than 300 charges have been laid. So far. Ontario's privacy commissioner says she will publish a special report about the use of non government emails and deleted messages related to the greenbelt. The ford government removed land from the greenbelt to build 50,000 homes in 2022 before reversing course, reports from the auditor general and integrity commissioner found the process favoured certain developers. Privacy commissioner patricia qasem says her office is working on 19 active accessed information appeals that are similar to concerns raised by ontario ndp leader marit stiles. I think first of all, I know you've, of course, viewed dozens of emails that were sent to and received by mister sackville using a g mail account in which >> Documents were shared I I think the premier's chief of staff appears to have repeatedly. Misled the integrity commissioner under oath. And that this is another example of a member of the premier senior team hiding things from the public. So I'm not mincing words. I think mister sackville should resign. And if he won't, the premier should fire him. >> The rcmp is now investigating the greenbelt removal process. It is 3:15 24 degrees.

The flooding killed four people, destroying roads and swamping - hundreds of homes. As heidi petracek reports, many nova scotians are still waiting for help that was promised by the province. >> Reporter: when flood waters rushed into streets and homes in nova scotia last july, it caused more than $170 million in insured damage. >> The driveway was covered. >> Reporter: and the flood burst through the back door and into clifton clifton's basement. The water had been high enough to leave appliances float. The cost, $143,000 taxes in. His insurance capped at 50,000. >> I took 50,000 off the 143. Left me with 90,000 and change. >> Reporter: then he applied to nova scotia's disaster financial assistance program, which pledged up to 200,000 for homeowners. But after months of waiting and piles of paperwork, clifton was offered $6,000. He appealed and was then offered 15,000. At 74 years old, he's taken out a second mortgage to pay for the $60,000 he has left >> What would you say if somebody said we're going to put your home back to the way it originally was. Just pay my contractor's bill. That's all I want. >> Reporter: the province is still processing more than 500 disaster assistance applications from the floods. 1,100 have been paid out to the tune of $14 million. >> For the ones that haven't been paid out, we're certainly very sympathetic. We know it's been very traumatic for them, but it's been challenging for us to. >> Reporter: the intact centre on climate adaptation created a tool to help municipalities prepare for and prevent urban flooding, which is expected to increase in frequency. >> We're expecting more short duration, intense rainfall events.

More than 1,200 others have been left homeless by the disaster and officials are now struggling to deliver badly-needed aid to the remote area after the landslide cut off access to major roads. >>> Just days after the british prime minister triggered an election, rishi sunak has announced a controversial complain pledge. If re-elected next month, he will bring back mandatory national service. The plan involves 18-year-olds choosing to either enlist in the military or perform community work. But the proposal could remain just that if sunak's political fortunes don't improve fast. Redmond shannon explains. >> Reporter: the timing of rishi sunak's election call surprised many. As has his first big campaign announcement. >> We will introduce a bold new model of national service for 18-year-olds. >> Reporter: the plan would see teens choose between a year in the military or complete 12 weekends of community work across a year. The vast majority would do the latter. Sunak claims it would help society and national security. These 16-year-olds, who can't vote yet, could be among the first to be enrolled. >> I found it on tiktok in the morning and my parents are speaking about it. >> What are your parents saying? >> It was divided. My dad, he thought rishi sunak's idea was good. But my mom thought otherwise. >> I really don't want rishi sunak to win.

A british documentary is shedding light on b.c.'s forestry practices, specifically its production of wood pellets. They're usually made up of wood chips, shaving, bark, and sawdust. And their low moisture creates a highly efficient burn that can be used as fuel for generating power or heat. This alternative form of energy is meant to divert millions of tonnes of waste from landfills, but as paul johnson explains, it is the way B.C. is producing wood pellets that have some environmentalists concerned. >> Reporter: you're watching a long form investigative news story about alleged environmental problems with the wood pellet industry in the interior of B.C. >> They breached canadian environmental regulations 189 times. >> Reporter: this program, though, was not broadcast in canada but was produced by the bbc of the U.K. >> As it turns out, the environmental and forest policies at play here in british columbia, alberta, and across canada are actually a huge point of contention right now in the united kingdom. >> Reporter: stand.earth forest campaigner teagan hansen is what got B.C. on the radar screen in britain is the drax power station, one of the biggest in the U.K. that runs off of wood pellets. Most of them sourced from B.C. hansen says the brits uncovered dozens of emissions violations at drax's plants in the interior >> In some cases, emissions were twice the allowed limit. In one case, the emissions were tripled the allowed limit. >> Reporter: aside from the air quality issues, what troubles conservationists in the U.K. and here is the extent to which drax may be turning whole logs into fuel pellets, which could undermine the company's self-proclaimed status as a green and renewable business. While drax told global its primary feedstock is residue from sawmills, hansen says she's seen whole logs herself at their facilities >> I've walked around these pellet plants. I've seen these enormous pile of logs. Anyone who goes to a pellet plant knows they're grinding trees to turn into pellets. >> Reporter: b.c.'s forest minister told global news that our old growth forests are not being turned into pellets. And on the emissions problem, drax told us they've all been minor and that they've been working to raise standards on the plants they've acquired in B.C. paul johnson, global news. >> Jeff: mexico is sweltering in an intense heat wave. Dozens of people have died from the so-called heat dome, and the most intense temperatures are yet to come. Mexicans are facing bone-dry conditions and serious water shortages. Temperatures could hit 35° in mexico city, far hotter than what the capital is used to, and unbearable in a city where only the well-off have air conditions.

Traveling near or traveling far, there will always be a need for a roof over one's head. And when there's a specific need, or a wish for a certain vibe, hotels and other properties within a network can help narrow down a list of seemingly infinite choices. Here are some networks worth checking out before booking your next room:

Travelers on a budget: Hostelling International, the world's largest network of youth hostels worldwide, was founded back in 1932 with the aim of promoting a newly-conceived concept. Today HI is made up of 60 Member Associations operating over 2,650 hostels. Properties within the network can be considered safe, clean, sustainably operated and family-friendly, as opposed to some independent hostels in large cities that tend to cater more to a younger and party-hungry segment of traveler. In many countries, membership is a prerequisite to a stay; in any event, membership can be purchased at the time of check-in. Despite the name, membership is open to all, with no age limits imposed, and enduringly popular with families. Online: hihostels.com

Cyclists: Those cycling along some of Germany's estimated 4,280 miles of bike paths are undoubtedly happy to see a ADFC Bett+Bike sticker on the door of any prospective place to spend the night. The designation, awarded by a subdivision of the German Cyclist's Association that operates within the tourism sector, can apply to a variety of guest establishments, from five-star hotels to simple campsites. Over 5,900 properties not only in Germany but also in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg and Switzerland can be found on the organization's website. Online: bettundbike.de

Those with property of their own to share can benefit from membership in Dachgeber, or Roof Giver. Members offer to provide space to bikers and other active travelers in exchange for the chance to take advantage of the same form of hospitality, which does not have to be mutual. Online: dachgeber.de

Child-friendly: Kinderhotel.info is not a network per se but rather a booking portal whose listings include over 700 hotels offering childcare and/or a comprehensive program of activities for their youngest guests. Once an attractive offer is located through its search filters, website users are led directly to the property in question. The properties listed are located in Austria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and other countries. Online: kinderhotel.info

Eco-friendly: Those after both sustainability and an upscale ambiance might wish to check out BIO HOTELS, a group of some 190 hotels whose member properties strive to use clean and renewable energy, have low CO2 emissions, offer natural cosmetics and serve regionally sourced, organic foods. Guests are encouraged to experience the surrounding countryside in a climate-neutral way, such as on a guided hike or a mountain bike tour organized by the hotel. Many such hotels also offer their own bike rental services. Hotels within the network are located in 11 European countries including Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and Slovenia. Online: biohotels.de

Luxurious: The Leading Hotels of the World is a network of more than 400 independent, high-end hotels found in over 80 countries. The group's collection of hotels are properties known for a combination of distinct features and luxurious appointments. Amongst its European offerings are a mixture of spas, golf clubs, beach resorts, urban, boutique and other properties. The posh places on offer include, for example, the Palais Coburg, a converted palace in Vienna, Austria or The Reserve, a property in Funchal, on the island of Madeira, Portugal, where services and amenities include unlimited spa access, a private pool and terrace, and luxury experiences such as a guided fishing boat ride or private yacht tour. Online: lhw.com

Barrier-free: AccessiblEurope is an organization based in Italy dealing with the concept of accessible tourism. Since the mid-1990's, AccessiblEurope has tasked itself with evaluating guest facilities including hotels, spa resorts, guest houses, campgrounds and other properties. Accessibility in both common areas and rooms specifically adapted for use by people with reduced mobility has been evaluated, allowing those with physical limitations and their travel companions to find properly adapted spaces and features such as wide doorways, spacious elevators, roll-in showers or bars affixed to the walls. Some properties will also offer accessible swimming pools or beaches, or even rehabilitation and a therapy center. Online: accessibleurope.com

Holiday rentals in France: Gîtes de France is a label assuring vacationers of a consistent standard of quality throughout the land. While the term gîte refers to a self-catering holiday home, often available for a weeklong stay or over a long holiday weekend, this is not the only type of property one can discover on the brand's website. Some 42,000 owners of hotels, bed and breakfasts, campgrounds, group lodgings and other properties throughout France can boast of being part of the brand. Online: gites-de-france.com

Farm stays in Italy: In contrast to a bed and breakfast or a rural vacation home, the Italian word ""agriturismo"" refers to a real, working farmhouse or winery. Accommodation ranges from rustic and simple to ultra-luxurious; what's common to all establishments is a connection to the land. The serving of high-quality food produced and prepared on-site often figures large within a property's offerings. The organization Agriturismo not only promotes such properties on its website but supports their owners with marketing tools, training projects and other forms of assistance.

That number is more than double the initial estimate. So far only five bodies have been recovered from the rubble.

If re-elected next month, he will bring back mandatory national service. The plan involves 18-year-olds choosing to either enlist in the military or perform community work.

A british documentary is shedding light on b.c.'s forestry practices, specifically its production of wood pellets. They're usually made up of wood chips, shaving, bark, and sawdust. And their low moisture creates a highly efficient burn that can be used as fuel for generating power or heat. This alternative form of energy is meant to divert millions of tonnes of waste from landfills, but as paul johnson explains, it is the way B.C. is producing wood pellets that have some environmentalists concerned. >> Reporter: you're watching a long form investigative news story about alleged environmental problems with the wood pellet industry in the interior of B.C. >> They breached canadian environmental regulations 189 times. >> Reporter: this program, though, was not broadcast in canada but was produced by the bbc of the U.K. >> As it turns out, the environmental and forest policies at play here in british columbia, alberta, and across canada are actually a huge point of contention right now in the united kingdom. >> Reporter: stand.earth forest campaigner teagan hansen is what got B.C. on the radar screen in britain is the drax power station, one of the biggest in the U.K. that runs off of wood pellets. Most of them sourced from B.C. hansen says the brits uncovered dozens of emissions violations at drax's plants in the interior >> In some cases, emissions were twice the allowed limit. In one case, the emissions were tripled the allowed limit. >> Reporter: aside from the air quality issues, what troubles conservationists in the U.K. and here is the extent to which drax may be turning whole logs into fuel pellets, which could undermine the company's self-proclaimed status as a green and renewable business. While drax told global its primary feedstock is residue from sawmills, hansen says she's seen whole logs herself at their facilities >> I've walked around these pellet plants. I've seen these enormous pile of logs. Anyone who goes to a pellet plant knows they're grinding trees to turn into pellets. >> Reporter: b.c.'s forest minister told global news that our old growth forests are not being turned into pellets. And on the emissions problem, drax told us they've all been minor and that they've been working to raise standards on the plants they've acquired in B.C. paul johnson, global news. >> Jeff: mexico is sweltering in an intense heat wave. Dozens of people have died from the so-called heat dome, and the most intense temperatures are yet to come. Mexicans are facing bone-dry conditions and serious water shortages. Temperatures could hit 35° in mexico city, far hotter than what the capital is used to, and unbearable in a city where only the well-off have air conditions.

This ranking, launched by ""Les Echos"" in partnership with Statista, aims to highlight French companies that excel in innovation and best practices.

Gilles David, CEO of ENERTIME, affirms: ""Being in the TOP 5 of Innovation Leaders in France is a great source of pride for all ENERTIME employees, past and present, who have developed over the past fifteen years, a unique proprietary technology in high-power turbomachinery and thermodynamic machines essential for the energy transition. This success is due not only to our teams but also to our shareholders who have supported us and to our clients who took the risk of trusting a young independent SME.""

Innovation Rooted in French Scientific Excellence

ENERTIME's technologies, based on thermodynamics combined with rotating machinery design, exploit a science born in France 200 years ago that is essential to the energy transition. They offer decarbonized and decentralized solutions as an alternative to centralized production solutions.

Tailored Solutions for Industrial Needs

ENERTIME provides customized systems for industrial clients, developing a unique ability to understand and address their issues, which fosters continuous and sustainable innovation.

Strategic Vision Coupled with Innovation

With full ownership of its intellectual property and patents, ENERTIME can deploy its technologies, developed on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines, in other fields. These capabilities are a significant asset for developing high-temperature, high-power heat pumps (HTHP). The natural gas expansion turbine installed for GRTgaz in Villiers-le-Bel and the partnership with STOLECT illustrate other successful applications of these technologies.

Inherently Competitive Technologies

A high-power ORC (typically 2 to 3 MW) for waste heat recovery is a very competitive solution with a typical LCOE[1] of €62/MWhe. A high temperature heat pump producing steam, reduces the CO2 emissions of steam production by a factor of ten in France and is 2 to 3 times more efficient than an electric boiler. It also avoids pollutant emissions associated with biomass or RDF[2] combustion. ENERTIME has developed these complex technologies without decarbonization subsidies, which were nonexistent before 2021, and plans to build 10 new machines in two years, in addition to the 12 commissioned between 2012 and 2023.

Strong International Ambition

To become competitive, decarbonization technologies must target a global market. ENERTIME has always aimed to develop relevant international solutions to compensate for a domestic market that take time to open. This strategy has led to successes on three continents and exports to eleven countries. ENERTIME expects most of its revenue to come from exports by 2030. In May 2024, ENERTIME was labeled an Efficient Solution for its ORC modules by the Solar Impulse Foundation and joined this global alliance.

French battery startup Verkor has secured €1.3bn in loans to finance its gigafactory plant in northern France, bringing its total financing to more than €3bn. The Verkor site is one of five gigafactories set to be built in France, part of Europe's push to secure its electric vehicle supply chain.

The new loan comes from the sixteen commercial banks and three public banks, including the European Investment Bank, Bpifrance, ING BANK NV and Banco Santander.

Verkor, which launched in 2020, is building its first gigafactory, in Dunkirk, which will cost €1.5bn. Gigafactories are large-scale facilities manufacturing the batteries needed to power the green transition.

Production is set to start in 2025, at which point the company says it will be manufacturing enough batteries to power 200k cars each year.

Gigafactories are capital intensive and companies building them are increasingly turning to non-dilutive fundraising to finance them. Swedish gigafactory startup Northvolt, Europe's best-capitalised gigafactory company, secured $5bn in debt in January this year.

Verkor previously closed a €850m Series C round in September last year, alongside €1.2bn of non-equity funding. Macquarie led the Series C. Other investors included Meridiam, Renault Group, EQT Ventures, EIT InnoEnergy and Sibanye-Stillwater.
