The move enables the offshore wind research lease, located about 28 nautical miles off Maine, to advance. Maine has 30 calendar days to accept, reject or request modifications to the lease.

""Floating wind technology can make offshore wind a reality in the Gulf of Maine,"" said BOEM Director Elizabeth Klein. ""BOEM will continue to work in partnership with the state of Maine as we move forward to facilitate the responsible development of offshore wind in this region, as well as the deployment of floating offshore wind technology nationwide.""

The state requested the research lease in October 2021 to study floating offshore wind energy technology and its deployment. If developed, the site would include up to 12 floating offshore wind turbines capable of generating up to 144 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy, according to BOEM.

The U.S. aims to have 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 15 GW of floating wind capacity by 2035.

Here's a look at other renewable energy news this week.

Waga Energy and Engie signed a biomethane purchase agreement (BPA) for renewable natural gas produced at the Veolia site in Claye-Souilly near Paris, Waga said on May 29.

The 13-year contract, which is the longest BPA signed to date in France, values the biomethane at a higher price than the subsidized tariff, Waga said in a news release. ""This enables Waga Energy to secure financing for the production unit through a long-term credit facility with the banks CIC and Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels,"" the company said.

The contract took effect May 1.

Up to 120 gigawatt hours (GWh) of RNG, equivalent to the consumption of 20,000 households, is produced annually at the Veolia site, according to Waga.

""Veolia is a key player in the production of bioenergy, already producing 1.6 terawatt-hour of biogas from waste anaerobic digestion in France alone,"" Veolia CEO Estelle Brachlianoff said. ""Through this partnership with Waga Energy and Engie, we are contributing to the development of a genuine green gas production industry at the European level, essential for the ecological transformation.""

Energy storage provider Torus will provide 26 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy storage capacity across a portion of real estate developer Gardner Group's portfolio, equivalent to powering nearly 1,000 homes for a full day.

Under a landmark deal, Torus will install its Torus Station energy storage and management system at Gardner's multiple properties, the company announced May 29.

The Torus Stations will integrate ""advanced"" battery and flywheel energy storage systems with Torus' software platform.

Torus said the integration enables energy management and demand response capabilities and connects renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The systems will be manufactured at Torus' South Salt Lake City, Utah, facility and are expected to begin installation in fourth-quarter 2024 with completion by first-quarter 2026.

""Partnering with Torus allows us to optimize our energy management, reduce our carbon footprint and provide enhanced value to our tenants,"" said Christian Gardner, CEO of Gardner Group. ""We look forward to the positive impact this project will have on our properties and the broader community.""

Verbund, an Austria-based electricity company, partnered with TotalEnergies and EREN Groupe joint venture company TE H2 to study implementation of a green hydrogen project in Tunisia.

Called H2 Notos, hydrogen would be produced with electrolyzers powered by onshore wind and solar energy with desalinated sea water, TotalEnergies said May 28. Ambitions are to initially produce 200,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, potentially scaling up to 1 million tons per year.

""H2 Notos has the potential to become a significant supplier of green hydrogen for Europe while fostering significant jobs creation in Tunisia,"" said TE H2 CEO David Corchia. ""We are entering into a phase of greenfield development and major technical work to assess the feasibility of the project and we will need to further deepen the highly constructive and fruitful collaboration we have enjoyed with the national and local authorities through H2 Notos.""

The hydrogen will access the European market via the SoutH2 Corridor hydrogen pipeline, which is expected to be commissioned around 2030. The pipeline connects North Africa to Italy, Austria and Germany.

Verbund will coordinate the transport of hydrogen toward Central Europe, according to the release, while TE H2 and Verbund will jointly develop, finance, construct and operate the project, according to the release.

Italy, Germany and Austria have signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of a network to transport hydrogen from the southern Mediterranean to northern Europe, the energy ministries of the three countries said on May 30.

The official announcement marks a concrete step in the European Union's strategy to secure renewable hydrogen supplies by 2030 to help decarbonize its most polluting industries.

""The Southern Hydrogen Corridor will provide renewable hydrogen imports from North Africa via southern Italy and further connect to the major hydrogen demand hubs in Italy, Austria and Germany,"" the German ministry said in a statement.

The link dubbed SoutH2, which last year won priority status from the European Commission, is considered important to develop a European market for renewable fuel.

A group of companies, including Italian gas grid operator Snam, have teamed up to build the SoutH2 pipeline by the beginning of the next decade, with a financial commitment of more than 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).

EDP Renewables North America has completed its 175-MW Crooked Lake Solar Park in Arkansas, the company said May 29.

Located near Blytheville in Mississippi County, the solar park is expected to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 30,000 Arkansas homes annually. The solar park is the latest utility-scale addition for EDPR, which now has facilities in 19 U.S. states.

""We're proud to continue our expansion in the South with a focus on serving the clean energy needs of Arkansas,"" stated EDP Renewables North America CEO Sandhya Ganapathy. ""By providing sustainable energy to Mississippi County and the surrounding area, we are generating economic growth and grid stability for generations to come in the region.""

The solar park, located on an approximately 1,800-acre site, utilizes single-axis tracking photovoltaic panels.

Florida-based Apricus Generation has acquired a controlling interest in Nexus Renewables, a solar and energy storage developer, according to a May 29 news release.

Nexus, which has a pipeline of about 500 MW of solar and energy storage projects in North America, is the first strategic acquisition of Apricus. The holding company launched earlier this year.

""As with many independent developers, Nexus has more project opportunities than access to capital,"" said Gautam Chandra, executive chairman and co-founder of Apricus Generation. ""By joining Apricus, they now have access to capital and expertise that will allow them to execute on their pipeline.""

New Jersey officials said the state will receive $125 million from a legal settlement with Denmark's Ørsted over the company's cancellation last year of two offshore wind farm projects.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities said in a statement that the funds will be used for investments in wind component manufacturing facilities and wind farms.

The settlement comes nearly seven months after Ørsted said it would stop developing the Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects off the coast of New Jersey as it struggled with soaring costs and supply chain delays.

The cancellations triggered an angry response from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who is banking on offshore wind to help achieve the state's climate change goals.

His administration said it would speed up the state's plans to procure additional offshore wind capacity by soliciting bids for new projects in the second quarter of 2025, more than a year ahead of schedule.

The utility regulator also said it would pause an offshore wind transmission planning effort with the regional power grid operator, PJM Interconnection, while it considers the impact of a new rule from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that reforms how large power lines are approved and paid for.",hartenergy.com,news,Hart Energy,,0.2549019607843137,454876280,6,https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2024/05/et-roundup_0.jpg?itok=wJmtyrgu,

Almost halfway through this make-or-break decade, we need to redouble our efforts if we are to keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius within reach. We are at a crucial turning point for global climate action.

The green transition requires enormous investment in Europe. But it also provides an opportunity to boost the economy and strengthen EU leadership in the fight against climate change. We need to keep global warming to a minimum, while also developing new innovative industries, boosting economic competitiveness, strengthening our strategic autonomy and ensuring a just green transition for all communities and regions in Europe.

Various studies by the European Commission and the International Energy Agency estimate that in Europe alone, between €360 billion and €620 billion will need to be mobilised each year to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal. This greening of investments comes amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting global energy and food crises, which have made it all the more urgent to decarbonise our energy and transport systems. This is where the European Union's REPowerEU plan comes in, enabling us to further accelerate our investments in renewable energy.

As the EU climate bank, the EIB committed a record total of €49 billion in green investment in 2023 (twice as much as in 2019) and is on track to achieve its goal of supporting €1 trillion in green finance this decade. Green investments now account for the majority of projects financed, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transport and innovation. On top of this huge increase in green investment, we have also pledged to align all of our financing with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and are already honouring this pledge.

In the area of innovation, more support is needed for advanced technology that can reduce carbon emissions in Europe and be scaled up globally. For example, we are supporting Europe's largest solar panel production facility in Italy and financing a new factory in Sweden that will produce millions of tonnes of green steel each year using green hydrogen. These projects not only address the climate issue, but also the European Union's strategic autonomy.

France was the largest beneficiary of EIB Group green finance in 2023. Of the approximately €12 billion of investment financed in 2023, almost €7 billion (64%) went to projects with a strong climate component. These projects help to increase employment and have a very tangible impact on people's lives in the local areas affected.

For example, in 2023, the EIB supported two gigafactories for electric vehicle batteries in Douai and Dunkirk in the Hauts-de-France region. Sorégies, a leading group of local energy companies in France based near Poitiers, was able to finance its investments in renewable energy and distribution network upgrades with the Bank's support. The EIB also helped to finance the automotive supplier Valeo's first green bond issue, and supported Engie's investments in new heating and cooling networks.

In the area of carbon-free transport, which receives the most EIB financing in France, the Bank has invested in urban transport in four cities (including Nantes), and in line 15 of the Grand Paris Express. It has also helped to finance rail transport in four regions. The green transition also affects the education and housing sectors, with investments in the construction and energy renovation of schools and social housing. Greener and more sustainable infrastructure such as this illustrates just how EU funding can help to improve the lives of people and passengers.

Businesses are key to implementing the transition to a new low-carbon growth model. One of the EIB's priorities is to actively support small and medium enterprises as they make this switch by providing intermediated financing through its banking partners, which totalled almost €3 billion in France last year. Our large-scale annual investment survey of businesses revealed that 89% of companies are taking action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and that 61% of the companies polled believe that climate events have an impact on their business. But only 36% have taken steps to strengthen their resilience to climate risks.

Investments in climate change adaptation need to be brought to the forefront of public and private sector discussions. If such investments are not made, or if they don't go far enough, the cost of inaction will be much higher in the long run, affecting people's quality of life and business competitiveness in Europe. For the EIB, this means more investment in the water, wastewater and agricultural sectors to safeguard our food security and sovereignty. In 2023, we signed a record number of loans for climate adaptation, and will continue to step up our efforts in this area in the coming years.",eib.org,news,EIB.org,,0.3254901960784313,454853828,1,https://www.eib.org/photos/rs/746f64ee-b4dc-4e51-9e6e-6cdf80376b5a/largeprvw/image.jpg,eng-9604337

The RNG has been sold under a Biomethane Purchase Agreement (BPA) without recourse to the feed-in tariff subsidised by the French government.

Since March 2022, Veolia has been supplying Waga Energy with biogas from the Claye Souilly landfill site in the Île-de-France region to produce RNG using its patented WAGABOX technology.

This RNG was initially sold to ENGIE under the feed-in tariff subsidised by the French government.

A Biomethane Purchase Agreement (BPA), valuing RNG at a higher price than the subsidised price, came into force on 1 May, for a period of 13 years. This is the longest BPA signed in France to date, and it enabled Waga Energy to retain the financing of the RNG production unit through a long-term loan from the CIC and Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels banks.

Through this agreement, ENGIE will be able to market unsubsidised RNG to its customers, who will be able to demonstrate a reduction in the environmental impact of their activities and the carbon footprint of their products.

The green value of this renewable gas is underpinned by the resale of Guarantees of Origin (GO) and Proof of Sustainability (PoS) certificates issued as part of ISCC certification.

Veolia's Claye Souilly site is home to one of France's largest RNG production units, with an annual capacity of 120 GWh of RNG per year, equivalent to the consumption of around 20,000 households.

Its commissioning avoids the emission of around 20,000 tonnes of CO2eq by reducing the use of fossil natural gas.

Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO of Veolia: ""Veolia is a key player in the production of bioenergy, already producing 1.6 terawatt-hours of biogas from waste anaerobic digestion in France alone. Through this partnership with Waga Energy and ENGIE, we are contributing to the development of a genuine green gas production industry at the European level, essential for the ecological transformation. This is perfectly aligned with our GreenUp strategic plan, which aims to accelerate the deployment of local, low-carbon green energy.""

Miya Paolucci, member of ENGIE's global energy management & sales executive committee: ""Veolia and Waga Energy are excellent industrial partners who, like ENGIE, are driven by the desire to develop RNG, a renewable, local and sovereign energy, which is one of the pillars of the energy transition. The signing of this new BPA contributes to ENGIE's goal to supply 30 TWh of RNG per year to our customers by 2030"".",bioenergy-news.com,news,Bioenergy Insight,,0.3490196078431373,454840395,29,https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bigstock-Landscape-with-a-country-road-62008214-768x514.jpg,

European Investors in Readiness as Energy, Minerals, and Mining Ministers From Across Africa Prepare for Barcelona

More than 33 ministers and 100 high-level public sector officials from across Africa will travel to Spain for the 26th edition of the Africa Energy Forum (aef), 25-28 June, at the Fira de Montjuïc, Barcelona

With Spain's commitment of $2.3 billion in funding to South Africa and its recently announced support for green hydrogen projects in Mauritania, the country joins France, Germany, Italy, the EU and the UK as European nations step up their commitment to clean energy development in the African continent.

But is the private sector ready for the investment opportunities that could potentially double those commitments?

Renewable energy capacity in Africa has almost doubled in the last decade, but it's not enough. A recent study from Climate Analytics indicates that Africa needs $100 billion a year in climate finance - five times current investment levels - to meet the renewable energy goals agreed at COP28.

As investors from nearly 90 countries around the world prepare to arrive in Barcelona for aef24, Simon Gosling, EnergyNet, said,

""The private sector has already demonstrated its willingness to commit billions to projects, but projects still aren't moving fast enough.

""It's the industrialised nations that will be most affected if Africa cannot significantly increase its electrification rates and unlock the investment landscape that is inhibiting proven private sector players.

""World food security, access to minerals, textiles, and industrial growth are critical to future economic growth, health, and sustainability. With Africa forecast to be home to a quarter of the world's population under 25 years by 2050, red tape must be reduced, and projects must start happening at scale and pace.""

This year's theme, 'Energy Systems for the Future - Balancing Africa's Needs with Global Goals' is set to tackle these barriers head on.

Public and private sector stakeholders will spend almost a full half-day together, behind closed doors, discussing the challenges both sides are facing. All attending ministers and Vice Presidents, as well as heads of utilities (national and municipal), regulatory bodies, DFIs, and private investors, will be in the room.

The new Corporate Leadership Roundtable will also give private sector developers and investors a platform to debate the opportunities and challenges they face in moving projects forward, sparking vital discussions before they meet with Ministers and utilities to establish an improved path for Africa's energy sector.

This innovative format will create the most high-level sessions ever held at the Africa Energy Forum, where business leaders can spend exclusive, quality time with public sector counterparts.

Key topics on the agenda across the four days include the potential of hydrogen on the continent; grid management; energy storage and distribution; the future roles of gas and mining; advancing renewable energy projects, distributed power, and commercial and industrial (C&I) projects to accelerate universal access; navigating power markets; and Africa's broader energy transition.

Among the nearly 2,500 delegates attending, an unprecedented number of ministers from across Africa will be in attendance, including ministers from Nigeria, Egypt, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Togo, Gabon, Central African Republic and Zambia.

""As specialists in renewable energy with transformative projects in Nigeria and Angola, for the second consecutive year, we are proud to be the forum sponsor of this imperative event for Africa."" said Adam Cortese, CEO, Sun Africa.

Wale Shonibare, Director, Energy Finance Solutions, Policy & Regulations, African Development Bank (AfDB), added: ""The African Development Bank's participation at the Africa Energy Forum underscores our commitment to sustained dialogue, collaboration, and partnerships to transform the energy landscape across Africa.

""In Barcelona, the Bank will showcase initiatives aimed at innovating finance, delivering technical assistance, and mobilizing investments to achieve universal access to modern, affordable, and reliable energy in Africa.""

MILAN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Atlante, the company of NHOA Group (Paris:NHOA) dedicated to electric vehicles fast and ultra-fast charging network, has won a tender issued by SAGAT S.p.A., the Italian company responsible for the management and development of Torino Airport, for the construction of the charging infrastructure in the airport hub in Turin.

In 2023, Piedmont airport broke all previously established traffic records, overcoming the 4.5 million passenger threshold for the first time. This tender is part of the broader sustainability strategy by SAGAT, called Torino Green Airport. Launched in 2021, the plan aims to manage infrastructure and airport operations in an energy-efficient manner, reducing consumption, increasing self-production from renewable sources, reducing emissions, and focusing on decarbonization, as well as waste, water, airport noise pollution, and green area management.

In this context, Atlante will install quick, fast, and ultra-fast charging stations at Torino Airport, powered 100% by renewable energy. The 19 electrified stalls, with the possibility of subsequent expansion, will be located in six areas of the airport, benefiting passengers and accompanying persons, rent-a-car services, and public mobility, with the goal of offering travelers and neighboring communities a simple and efficient charging experience while meeting the growing global energy demand. Atlante's charging points, accessible to people with reduced mobility, will be available 24/7 and open to all electric vehicles.

""We are proud to count among our successes one of the most important hubs in the northwest, which consolidates our position as a leader in the strategic airport sector. Thanks to our charging stations powered by renewable energy, we will contribute to the sustainability plan of Torino Airport, offering a valuable service to all travelers, users of the airport and the surrounding community, building a mobility ecosystem that enables charging of any electric vehicle in a few minutes"", commented Stefano Terranova, CEO of Atlante.

Atlante's project includes the use of canopies and modular solutions, ranging from the 22kW quick charging to the 200kW ultra-fast charging, in various airport areas, as well as energy storage systems to handle peak demand times, and finally, the introduction of an innovative solution to prevent the unauthorized occupation of parking spaces. All these elements confirm Atlante's integrated technological approach, aiming to offer a seamless charging experience.

""We are happy that Atlante proves to be once again the ideal partner to support strategic infrastructures for the energy transition. Our strong presence in northern Italy and established leadership in airports make us proud promoters of sustainable mobility in the Piedmont area. This bond is further strengthened by Atlante's presence in Turin at the innovative urban district ToDream, the forefront of the integration of shopping, entertainment, sports, and services, which after one year decided to increase Atlante's charging points in its parking lots from 130 to 230, confirming our commitment to a sustainable and innovative future in close relation to the territory"", commented Gabriele Tuccillo, CEO of Atlante Italia.

Technological innovation, the use of energy from renewable sources, as well as fast and intuitive user experience are at the core of Atlante's philosophy to create truly sustainable, zero-emission mobility that is accessible to everyone. The recent agreement with SAGAT for the electrification of Torino Airport will bring Atlante to be present in major Italian airports with over 50 charging points, including Rome Fiumicino, Milan Linate, and Malpensa airports, confirming its leading role in this segment.

Minister for Water, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Shane Rattenbury said the new grants will help boost the number of DC fast chargers across Canberra and will continue our progress toward meeting our target of at least 180 public EV chargers in the ACT by 2025.

Earlier EV grants have already delivered 39 new public EV chargers (with 65 charging bays) across the ACT, A further 21 chargers are set to be delivered under the previous grant round by the end of 2024. There are currently 156 public EV charging stations operating in the ACT.

""The first projects to be supported by this new funding round will see 39 new chargers installed in places where they are needed the most - near tourist hot spots, shopping centres and high-density residential areas.

""Providing more fast (DC) chargers will plug gaps in our existing charger network and ensure the right mix of AC and DC chargers across Canberra. This means people will have the option to charge quickly when needed but have the option to use an AC charger for longer visits like work, school, or sport.

""The 3 new DC fast chargers that have been installed at ANU, and the 2 new DC fast chargers at Casey Marketplace, have already made fast charging more accessible and we plan to install more like these. The 150kW chargers at ANU can charge 6 vehicles at once and are strategically located at the ANU School of Art & Design, close to nearby apartments and employment hubs.

""We understand that people who live in apartments and townhouses have extra barriers to installing home chargers, which is why we are prioritising putting public chargers in areas of high-density housing.

""Delivering accessible charging continues to be a challenge in part because there is no national standard in place. We will be working with the grant recipients to deliver charging bays in priority locations that will be accessible to EV drivers with mobility issues. Providing accessible charging will continue to be a focus as we expand Canberra's public EV charging network.

""Transport currently makes up over 60% of ACT emissions, with private vehicle use accounting for most transport emissions. Installing more public chargers is just one of the ways we are supporting the electrification of our city's transport system,"" Minister Rattenbury said.

Green hydrogen refers to hydrogen gas produced via electrolysis, using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or hydropower. Unlike conventional methods of hydrogen production, which often involve fossil fuels and release carbon emissions, green hydrogen production is environmentally friendly and sustainable. The decarbonization potential of green hydrogen has encouraged countries across the world to compete in leading the market in terms of production & usage. From ambitious targets to large scale projects, the green hydrogen market periodically sees new announcements from time to time. The EU, for instance, has under its proposal REPowerEU, set an ambitious target to achieve a supply of 20,000 kilo tons of green hydrogen by 2030 - 10,000 kilo tons produced, and 10,000 kilo tons imported.

Several electrolyzer-based projects are now currently operating across the world, with cumulative capacity exceeding 300 MW. Major producers operating large-scale electrolyzer-based projects include Air Liquide, Nel ASA, Shell, Honeywell UOP, REFHYNE, and Baofeng Energy. New projects from producers such as Fertiglobe, ScottishPower, Enel S.p.A., Engie SA, Linde, bp, and Kawasaki, meanwhile, are slated to add in the forthcoming years. While the current capacity is insufficient to significantly reduce carbon emissions, it is a noteworthy development towards the acceleration of the technology. Supply chain development, demand, and technology will determine the future course of the green hydrogen market over the forecast period.

While the transition towards sustainability aided by favourable legislative policies are key demand drivers, the green hydrogen market also faces major challenges ahead: high production costs and slow end-use adoption are bottlenecks that continue to weigh on the growth. The market study analyses these impeding factors in detail and also presents strategic recommendations for producers to navigate the landscape.

This initial project laid the groundwork for Stowen's continuous commitment to safety, efficiency and client satisfaction - a commitment that remains steadfast to this day. Over the years, the company has experienced exponential growth and success within the East of England, establishing strong partnerships with several clients in the region's burgeoning energy sector.

Stowen's core services encompass a comprehensive range of offerings tailored to meet the diverse needs of offshore energy projects.

From one-off inspections to large-scale construction operations, Stowen is able to pull on an experienced management team in delivering inspection and integrity, maintenance, construction and project management under a single contract.

Comprising of 60 turbines, the project is poised to provide power to approximately 650,000 UK homes upon its scheduled completion in 2025. Stowen also secured a statutory inspection and maintenance contract, alongside an ad/hoc framework agreement for dynamic labour solutions, further highlighting its adaptability and drive for excellence in asset management.

Starting with just one team member, Stowen's Scottish team has grown to include a team of dedicated staff members, demonstrating the company's commitment to investing in local talent and fostering community development.

Inspection manager James MacDonald said: ""We aim to empower local talent by providing them with the skills and knowledge needed to start their career in the offshore wind sector whilst bolstering the existing employees' future within the north of Scotland.""

Stowen has also established an operational base in Inverness, enabling it to strengthen relationships with local partners, enhance responsiveness to client needs and actively contribute to the economic development of the region.

In addition to building a strong team and infrastructure, Stowen places a high priority on utilising local resources and materials whenever feasible. By sourcing materials locally, Stowen not only ensures a more sustainable and efficient supply chain, but also supports the growth and development of local industries.

This approach aligns with Stowen's broader commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices.

Looking ahead to 2024, Stowen is continuing its trajectory of growth and success, recently securing a new inspection framework agreement with Transmission Investment, a prominent independent transmission business in the UK.

The contract underscores Stowen's focus on delivering comprehensive inspection and maintenance services for Transmission Investment's offshore substation on Moray East.

Keynote speakers, government officials, and industry leaders will convene to discuss Asia's growing role in global climate leadership and sustainable energy solutions. Notable companies slated to attend the Japan Energy Summit and Exhibition include ADNOC, bp, Chevron, Cheniere, ExxonMobil, ENGIE, JERA, Tokyo Gas and Kraken.

Charles Oppenheimer, the grandson of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Founder of Oppenheimer Energy Ventures, will also be attending the summit and contributing to its legacy of innovation and forward-thinking by a keynote address on Tuesday, 4 June (Tuesday), from 17:30 to 17:45 Japan Standard Time (JST).

Yuriy Humber, Founder, Japan NRG, stated: ""Japan spearheads energy innovation amidst evolving landscapes of technology, regulation, and net-zero goals. The 'Hydrogen Demand in Japan' report, rooted in METI's strategy, explores hydrogen's pivotal role, and promises insights for the energy value chain.""

These companies will be part of the collaborative contributions propelling the energy transition within the exhibition and through the extensive dialogues during the summit sessions. The convergence of industry leaders and innovators at the Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition highlights the importance of partnerships across sectors to achieve a carbon-neutral future.

Recognising countries' diverse energy mixes, the Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition will support the creation of practical roadmaps for energy transitions, from which other regions and territories can take notes.

Japanese trading firm ITOCHU Corporation and Malaysia's Malakoff Corporation Berhad are already aiming to decarbonise power plants in Malaysia by the reduction of coal usage via ammonia co-firing and developing a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant that uses hydrogen converted from ammonia. This aims to contribute to decarbonisation by supplying the power plant and also a nearby industrial complex.

According to the ""Hydrogen Demand In Japan Report By Japan NRG"", an exclusive report created in advance of the event, ammonia-coal co-firing is spreading faster in the power sector that runs larger coal power plants. In 2023, it was highlighted that JERA and Kyushu Electric conducted co-firing demos, and three other regional utilities said they plan either ammonia or hydrogen co-firing. On October 26, 2023, Kobe Steel said that its two 700 MW coal power plants will start 20% ammonia co-firing by 2030, and two other 650 MW plants will follow.

The Hydrogen Strategy update highlights the importance of hydrogen's carbon intensity amidst the global shift towards cleaner energy. Japan, recognising this trend, is actively participating in the transition to cleaner hydrogen. This shift is also reflected in the 2017 strategy, which introduced the concept of ""green hydrogen"" as a premium, renewables-driven fuel, suggesting that even ""grey hydrogen"" could attain premium status with carbon offsetting. Currently, Japan's annual production of grey hydrogen stands at 1.9 million tons, with the government aiming for 3 million tons/year of hydrogen availability by 2030.

Amidst these developments, there is growing optimism surrounding ammonia as a viable solution. Key businesses in Yamaguchi are planning to establish a 1 million ton/year ammonia supply chain. The Japan Clean Ammonia Fuel Association anticipates a significant surge in ammonia demand by 2030, driven primarily by 20% co-firing, equivalent to 500,000 tons/year of hydrogen. Furthermore, the updated government strategy expands hydrogen's role beyond fuel to include raw materials for synthetic methane, synthetic fuel, and carbon recycling, sparking innovation in diverse industries such as synthetic textiles and plastics production.

Meanwhile, in the Asia-Pacific region, the report also noted that countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, have already begun researching and studying the use of ammonia co-firing, with Taiwan becoming the seventh Asia-Pacific nation to join the group of nations.

Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, organiser of the event, said: ""The Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition is set to be a platform to facilitate and showcase collaborations between energy giants. We strongly believe in the need for global partnerships to achieve a carbon-neutral future, and this event will reiterate Japan's role as a global leader in pioneering innovative energy. Despite challenges, Japan is evidently paving the way for energy transition in the region; All eyes are on Japan, and there is much we can learn from them.""

Released 30/05/2024

The ACT Government will continue to support the expansion of Canberra's public Electric Vehicle charger network, with a new round of grants to deliver 39 more EV chargers in key locations across the city by 2025.

Minister for Water, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Shane Rattenbury said the new grants will help boost the number of DC fast chargers across Canberra and will continue our progress toward meeting our target of at least 180 public EV chargers in the ACT by 2025.

Earlier EV grants have already delivered 39 new public EV chargers (with 65 charging bays) across the ACT, A further 21 chargers are set to be delivered under the previous grant round by the end of 2024. There are currently 156 public EV charging stations operating in the ACT.

""The first projects to be supported by this new funding round will see 39 new chargers installed in places where they are needed the most - near tourist hot spots, shopping centres and high-density residential areas.

""Providing more fast (DC) chargers will plug gaps in our existing charger network and ensure the right mix of AC and DC chargers across Canberra. This means people will have the option to charge quickly when needed but have the option to use an AC charger for longer visits like work, school, or sport.

""The 3 new DC fast chargers that have been installed at ANU, and the 2 new DC fast chargers at Casey Marketplace, have already made fast charging more accessible and we plan to install more like these. The 150kW chargers at ANU can charge 6 vehicles at once and are strategically located at the ANU School of Art & Design, close to nearby apartments and employment hubs.

""We understand that people who live in apartments and townhouses have extra barriers to installing home chargers, which is why we are prioritising putting public chargers in areas of high-density housing.

""Delivering accessible charging continues to be a challenge in part because there is no national standard in place. We will be working with the grant recipients to deliver charging bays in priority locations that will be accessible to EV drivers with mobility issues. Providing accessible charging will continue to be a focus as we expand Canberra's public EV charging network.

""Transport currently makes up over 60% of ACT emissions, with private vehicle use accounting for most transport emissions. Installing more public chargers is just one of the ways we are supporting the electrification of our city's transport system,"" Minister Rattenbury said.

The successful providers for the first projects to be supported by this funding are ActewAGL, BP, ENGIE and Evie, who will receive a total of $626,275.

This thirteen-year contract is the longest BPA signed to date in France and marks a significant step forward in the development of local, low-carbon energies.

Since March 2022, Waga Energy has been upgrading the landfill gas produced on Veolia's site into RNG, which is directly injected into the local gas network to be used by homes and businesses in the region. Previously, the biomethane was sold to Engie under a feed-in tariff subsidized by the French government.

The new contract, which came into effect on May 1, 2024, values the biomethane at a higher price than the subsidized tariff. This enables Waga Energy to secure financing for the production unit through a long-term credit facility with the banks CIC and Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels.

This agreement enables Engie to market unsubsidized biomethane to its customers, offering a unique opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to reducing the environmental impact of their activities and the carbon footprint of their products. The green value of this renewable gas is enhanced by the resale of Guarantees of Origin (GOs) and Proof of Sustainability (PoS) certificates issued as part of ISCCcertification.

Veolia's site, one of the largest RNG production units in France, it produces up to 120 GWh of RNG each year, equivalent to the consumption of 20,000 households.

Climate Change Increases Need for Renewable Energy Sources

Climate change poses serious threats to the environment and humanity. Rising global temperatures are causing sea levels to rise and extreme weather events to become more frequent and intense.

In order to curb climate change, there is an urgent need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable and clean energy sources. Hydropower is one of the most abundant and cost-effective renewable energy sources available.

As concerns about climate change increase, many governments and organizations are setting ambitious targets to increase the share of renewable energy in their energy mix. This is driving significant growth in the development of new hydropower plants globally.

Growing Energy Demand in Developing Economies

Rapid economic growth and rising populations in developing countries are fueling strong increases in electricity demand. Many developing nations lack sufficient domestic oil and gas reserves and must import fossil fuels to meet their energy needs.

At the same time, expanding access to electricity remains a top priority to support continued economic and social development. Hydropower offers a means for developing countries to meet rising electricity demand with domestic, renewable resources.

Unlike other renewables, hydropower also provides grid stability and energy storage capacity to support increased electrification. To ensure energy security while pursuing sustainable growth, developing market economies are making hydropower development a key part of their national energy strategies.

This is driving significant investment and growth in hydropower capacity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Hydropower Market Trends: Modernization and Refurbishment of Aging Infrastructure

Many hydropower plants worldwide, especially in North America, Europe and China, are reaching 50-100 years of operations. While hydropower itself is renewable, the infrastructure delivering it requires periodic replacement and upgrades to extend plant lifetimes.

Aging equipment, deteriorating civil works, and lost generating capacity due to sedimentation are prompting owners to invest heavily in plant modernizations. This involves activities like turbine and generator rehabilitations, dam surface treatments, dredging of reservoirs, automation improvements, and sometimes full redevelopments.

Beyond refurbishment, decommissioning and redevelopment of legacy dams also presents opportunities to increase output at existing sites. With proper investments, the operational lifetimes of hydropower assets can be extended by decades, supporting sustainable hydropower generation for the long-term.

This modernization and repowering of old hydropower infrastructure is a growing market trend.

""The EIB is happy to support Amethis in its effort to invest in small companies in low- and middle-income countries across Africa. African enterprises still don't have enough patient equity capital they need for them to grow, which is what our partnership with funds like Amethis seek to address."" EIB Vice President, Thomas Ostros commented on the deal.

According to EIB, climate change could wipe out 15% of Africa's gross domestic product by 2030, which would mean an additional 100 million people living in extreme poverty by the end of the decade.

Further, the African Development Bank says Africa currently receives only 3% of global climate finance flows. With the scarcity of public funding, the role of public private partnerships is to mobilise climate finance at scale. Multilateral Development Banks, like the European Investment Bank, work in different markets through innovative solutions that de-risk and crowd in private capital.

Over the last decade the, European Investment Bank has provided more than €32 billion for green energy, water, urban, education, agriculture, telecom, health and business investment in 40 countries across the continent.

This included a €10 million investment in Benin in 2022, which brings low-carbon solar energy to 600,000 people; in Uganda, a €12.5 million investment in ENGIE, which brought 1.4 million Ugandans access to reliable and affordable off-grid solar energy; a €10 million investment in Madagascar that helped WeLight give 45,000 households solar energy.

Last year, the EIB invested over €350 million in equity funds operating across the African continent. This brings the overall investment in funds to nearly €3 billion, providing financing (equity and/or debt) to over 2,000 investees. A majority of these investments have been in the climate action and environment sustainability sectors.

EIB also signed a US$ 40 million investment deal with Acre Export Finance Fund I during the Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi last year, to invest in climate infrastructure across Africa.

12 years after its creation, Amethis has supported the growth of more than 30 African companies employing directly more than 40,000 people.",kenyanwallstreet.com,news,"Kenya's Inflation Rate Down to 5.7% in March on Flour, Fuel Price Drop",Eunniah Mbabazi,0.192156862745098,454685186,1,https://kenyanwallstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EIB.jpeg,eng-9604337

The learning initiative was made possible through the support of the French Development Agency (AFD) and the EU and was organised by a consortium including Tractebel Engineering France and Bureau Veritas Vietnam.

The primary aim is to glean insight and best practices from the operational methodologies employed at the Coo PSP and also at the Bevercé Hydropower Plant. Led by HSE and hydropower experts from Tractebel Engineering, the study tour offers a holistic understanding of global HSE implementation at hydropower plants.

Both plants are operated by Paris-based multinational utilities company ENGIE and play key roles in Belgium's energy mix. Coo PSP offers flexibility amid the current energy transition with a maximum capacity of 1,080MW.

The EVN delegation learned about the ongoing projects to increase power at Coo PSP. By next year, Coo PSP will have increased its reservoir storage capacity, resulting in an additional 79MW of power generation and a 450MWh storage boost since 2021.

The visit also provided insight into operational challenges related to HSE in hydroelectric power plants, covering a range of topics such as equipment maintenance, team organisation, risk assessment, daily HSE operations, and interactions with contractors and subcontractors.

During the visit, the delegation participated in in-depth discussions on project nuances. They observed effective safety protocol implementation adhering to global HSE standards, ensuring a secure working environment during ongoing plant operations, and new construction activities.

This study tour represents a significant stride forward for EVN, the AFD, and the consortium of consulting partners, in championing HSE standards and sustainable operational practices.",vir.com.vn,news,Vietnam Investment Review - VIR,Vietnam Investment Review,0.2862745098039217,454670516,1,https://vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2024/052024/27/16/in_social/7aed4c953e03432bd231cd2fd762109a.jpg?randTime=1716972144,

A Panel Discussion on How Can Japan Be A Leader in the World's Hydrogen Economy

The upcoming Japan Energy Summit and Exhibition, scheduled from 3-5 June 2024 at Tokyo Big Sight, will serve as a critical platform to address Japan's strategic shift towards greener energy alternatives, particularly green hydrogen and ammonia, in line with its stringent targets for 2030.

Notable companies slated to attend the Japan Energy Summit and Exhibition include ADNOC, BP, Chevron, Cheniere, ExxonMobil, ENGIE, JERA, Tokyo Gas and Kraken.

Charles Oppenheimer, the grandson of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Founder of Oppenheimer Energy Ventures, will also be attending the summit and contributing to its legacy of innovation and forward-thinking by a keynote address on Tuesday, 4 June (Tuesday), from 17:30 to 17:45 Japan Standard Time (JST).

Yuriy Humber, Founder, Japan NRG, stated: ""Japan spearheads energy innovation amidst evolving landscapes of technology, regulation, and net-zero goals. The 'Hydrogen Demand in Japan' report, rooted in METI's strategy, explores hydrogen's pivotal role, and promises insights for the energy value chain.""

These companies will be part of the collaborative contributions propelling the energy transition within the exhibition and through the extensive dialogues during the summit sessions. The convergence of industry leaders and innovators at the Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition highlights the importance of partnerships across sectors to achieve a carbon-neutral future.

Decarbonisation in the Asia-Pacific Region

Recognising countries' diverse energy mixes, the Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition will support the creation of practical roadmaps for energy transitions, from which other regions and territories can take notes.

Japanese trading firm ITOCHU Corporation and Malaysia's Malakoff Corporation Berhad are already aiming to decarbonise power plants in Malaysia by the reduction of coal usage via ammonia co-firing and developing a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant that uses hydrogen converted from ammonia. This aims to contribute to decarbonisation by supplying the power plant and also a nearby industrial complex.

According to the ""Hydrogen Demand In Japan Report By Japan NRG"", an exclusive report created in advance of the event, ammonia-coal co-firing is spreading faster in the power sector that runs larger coal power plants. In 2023, it was highlighted that JERA and Kyushu Electric conducted co-firing demos, and three other regional utilities said they plan either ammonia or hydrogen co-firing. On October 26, 2023, Kobe Steel said that its two 700 MW coal power plants will start 20% ammonia co-firing by 2030, and two other 650 MW plants will follow.

The Hydrogen Strategy update highlights the importance of hydrogen's carbon intensity amidst the global shift towards cleaner energy. Japan, recognising this trend, is actively participating in the transition to cleaner hydrogen. This shift is also reflected in the 2017 strategy, which introduced the concept of ""green hydrogen"" as a premium, renewables-driven fuel, suggesting that even ""grey hydrogen"" could attain premium status with carbon offsetting. Currently, Japan's annual production of grey hydrogen stands at 1.9 million tons, with the government aiming for 3 million tons/year of hydrogen availability by 2030.

Amidst these developments, there is growing optimism surrounding ammonia as a viable solution. Key businesses in Yamaguchi are planning to establish a 1 million ton/year ammonia supply chain. The Japan Clean Ammonia Fuel Association anticipates a significant surge in ammonia demand by 2030, driven primarily by 20% co-firing, equivalent to 500,000 tons/year of hydrogen. Furthermore, the updated government strategy expands hydrogen's role beyond fuel to include raw materials for synthetic methane, synthetic fuel, and carbon recycling, sparking innovation in diverse industries such as synthetic textiles and plastics production.

Meanwhile, in the Asia-Pacific region, the report also noted that countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, have already begun researching and studying the use of ammonia co-firing, with Taiwan becoming the seventh Asia-Pacific region to join the group.

Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, organiser of the event, said: ""The Japan Energy Summit & Exhibition is set to be a platform to facilitate and showcase collaborations between energy giants. We strongly believe in the need for global partnerships to achieve a carbon-neutral future, and this event will reiterate Japan's role as a global leader in pioneering innovative energy. Despite challenges, Japan is evidently paving the way for energy transition in the region; All eyes are on Japan, and there is much we can learn from them.""

The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub TRNLTTFMc1 was down 1.43 euros at 33.80 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) at 0755 GMT, according to LSEG data.

The July contract TRNLTTFMc4 was down 1.00 euro at 34.10 euros/MWh, while the British month-ahead contract TRGBNBPMM4 inched down by 0.45 pence to 81.60 pence per therm.

Flows from Norway are rebounding following outages and the current maintenance schedule from the start of June will have a negligible impact from some small planned outages, said Wayne Bryan, head of European gas research at LSEG.

Wind output in Britain is set to remain above normal levels until at least June 4, while north-west European wind output is forecast to drop below normal from May 30 to June 1, LSEG data showed.

Higher wind generation typically reduces demand for gas from power plants.

However, there is some risk around liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply, said analysts at Engie EnergyScan.

""Even if they have fallen in the past weeks, LNG flows to Asia remain high and they could increase further as summer power demand increases in the region,"" they said.

""The resulting drop in LNG flows to Europe could tighten the European gas balance. We can understand in these conditions that market participants are hesitant to be truly bearish on European gas prices,"" they added.

In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract CFI2Zc1 was down 1.35 euro at 74.90 euros per metric ton.

In the fourth week of May, prices in most major European electricity markets increased between Monday, May 20, and Friday, May 24. Although prices fell over the weekend, the weekly averages of all analyzed markets rose compared to the previous week. The Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries reached the highest percentage price increase, 87%. In contrast, the IPEX market of Italy and the N2EX market of the United Kingdom registered the smallest percentage increases, 0.1% and 9.7%, respectively. In the rest of the markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices rose between 30% in the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium and 71% in the MIBEL market of Portugal.

In the fourth week of May, weekly averages exceeded €45/MWh in most analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the Nordic and French markets, with averages of €24.59/MWh and €36.50/MWh, respectively. The Italian market registered the highest weekly average, €96.18/MWh. In the rest of analyzed markets, prices ranged from €46.40/MWh in the Spanish market to €89.78/MWh in the British market.

Regarding hourly prices, most analyzed European markets registered negative prices on Sunday, May 26. The exceptions were the British and Italian markets, with no negative prices in the fourth week of May. The German, Belgian and Dutch markets also reached negative prices on May 20 and the last two markets, on May 22. In the case of the Nordic market, there were negative prices on May 25 and 26.

On Sunday, May 26, from 14:00 to 15:00, the German, Belgian, French and Dutch markets reached prices below ?€23/MWh. The Dutch market registered the lowest hourly price of the fourth week of May, ?€23.89/MWh.

On the other hand, on Monday, May 27, from 20:00 to 21:00, the German market reached a price of €221.46/MWh, the highest price since early December 2023 in this market.

During the week of May 20, the rise in the average price of gas and CO emission allowances had an upward influence on European electricity market prices. In addition, in markets such as Germany, Spain or Portugal, wind energy production decreased in the fourth week of May. In the case of the British, Italian and Dutch markets, electricity demand increased, contributing to weekly prices being higher than in the previous week.

AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's price forecasts indicate that in some European electricity markets, such as the French, Spanish or Portuguese markets, prices might fall in the last week of May, influenced by the increase in wind energy production in these markets. On the other hand, in other markets such as Germany or Italy, where wind energy production might decrease, prices might continue to increase.

Brent oil futures for the Front?Month in the ICE market registered their weekly maximum settlement price, $83.71/bbl, on Monday, May 20. However, prices declined during the first four sessions of the fourth week of May. As a result, on Thursday, May 23, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, $81.36/bbl. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 2.3% lower than the previous Thursday and the lowest since the first half of February. On Friday, May 24, there was a slight recovery and the settlement price was $82.12/bbl.

In the fourth week of May, expectations that interest rates will remain high in the United States for longer due to inflation exerted a downward influence on Brent oil futures prices. In addition, US oil reserves increased.

As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front?Month, in the fourth week of May they continued with the price increases initiated in the last sessions of the previous week. On Monday, May 20, they registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €31.77/MWh, which was already 7.4% higher than the previous Monday. Price rises continued until Thursday, May 23. On that day, these futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €35.83/MWh. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 18% higher than the previous Thursday and the highest since the first half of December 2023. On Friday, May 24, after a 4.8% decrease, the settlement price was €34.11/MWh. This was still 11% higher than the previous Friday.

In the fourth week of May, forecasts of higher demand for air conditioning, combined with lower supply, drove prices higher. Forecasts of high temperatures for the coming summer and high demand for liquefied natural gas from the Asian market might continue to exert their upward influence on TTF gas futures prices. However, European reserve levels remain high. On the other hand, news that Russian gas supplies to Austria might end this summer due to legal problems in making payments also contributed to the price increase in the fourth week of May.

As for CO emission allowance futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2024, they reached their weekly minimum settlement price, €74.22/t, on Monday, May 20. However, this price was already 5.0% higher than the last session of the previous week and 6.3% higher than the previous Monday. On Tuesday, May 21, these futures registered their weekly maximum settlement price, €76.25/t. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 8.6% higher than the previous Tuesday and the highest since the first half of January. Subsequently, prices started a slight downward trend, although they remained above €75/t for the rest of the fourth week of May.

Since May 1, 2024, Waga Energy has been selling the Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) produced at Veolia's Val Pôle in Claye-Souilly (north-central France), to ENGIE under a Biomethane Purchase Agreement (BPA), without recourse to the feed-in tariff subsidized by the French government. This 13-year contract is the longest BPA signed in France to date.

With the growing need to develop local, low-carbon energies, Veolia, a leader in bioenergies, Waga Energy, a global expert in the production of Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) from landfills, and ENGIE, a world leader in low-carbon energy and services, have created an unprecedented partnership to take a significant step forward in the development of the RNG industry in France.

Since March 2022, Veolia has been supplying Waga Energy with biogas from the Claye-Souilly landfill site in the Île-de-France region to produce RNG using its patented WAGABOX® technology. This RNG was initially sold to ENGIE under the feed-in tariff subsidized by the French government.

A Biomethane Purchase Agreement (BPA), valuing RNG at a higher price than the subsidized price, came into force on May 1, 2024, for a period of 13 years. This is the longest BPA signed in France to date, which enabled Waga Energy to retain the financing of the RNG production unit through a long-term loan from the CIC and Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels banks.

Through this agreement, ENGIE will be able to market unsubsidized RNG to its customers, who will thus be able to demonstrate a reduction in the environmental impact of their activities and the carbon footprint of their products. The green value of this renewable gas is underpinned by the resale of Guarantees of Origin (""GO"") and Proof of Sustainability (""PoS"") certificates issued as part of ISCC1 certification.

Veolia's Claye-Souilly site is home to one of France's largest RNG production units, with an annual capacity of 120 GWh of RNG per year, equivalent to the consumption of around 20,000 households.

Active in India since 2014, Engie has so far invested around roughly $1.1 billion at Tuesday's exchange rate. Its RE installed base is 1.1 GW, comprising 800 megawatt (MW) solar power and 250 MW wind energy across 7 States.

""We are building 4 new projects, which we won recently. One we've already started construction in Gujarat, a 400 MW project, which we won last year. Three other projects -- NTPC (300 MW), NHPC (250 MW) and SECI (100 MW),"" Engie India CEO and Country Manager Amit Jain told businessline.

Expanding presence

The three projects, with 650 MW capacity, will go for construction around the middle or end of 2024. Engie is waiting for the power purchase agreements (PPAs) to be signed. It has already received the letter of award (LoA), Jain added.

""So, we have 1.25 GW in the pipeline and we hope to commission them by end-2025 or early-2026. We will double our capacity from 1.1 GW to about 2.2 GW. I think what we are looking at is a total investment in India of about roughly ₹7,000 crore, by the end of 2025. That is going to be a significant investment,"" he said.

The Pune-headquartered company aims to increase its base to 5 GW by 2030. Its parent, Engie, which operates in 31 countries employing more than 96,000 professionals, has an installed renewables base of 41.4 GW and clocked revenues of around $102 billion in 2023.

When asked about India's importance in Engie's overall trajectory, Jain pointed out that Engie India targets to add around 800 MW RE capacity every year.

""That is a significant investment given what we are doing globally. Globally, our target is 6 GW every year till 2030. So, 800 MW out of that is a significant capacity from one country that we are doing and being present in 30 countries. So, I think India is gaining prominence in our targeted countries,"" he stressed.

Clean energy solutions

When asked about issues concerning grid stability due to the growing installed base of renewables, Jain said that Engie leverages cutting edge tech solutions to manage and maintain grid stability.

""We have a grid or energy management system, GEMS, which we have currently working in various other markets, including the US and Europe, where there is high penetration of renewables. What GEMS does is balances the energy requirement vis-a-vis the grid,"" he added.

Global Energy Management and Sales (GEMS) provides energy procurement solutions and risk management services. It offers a wide range of decarbonisation solutions to help clients respond to energy and climate challenges.

Commending the government's efforts to increase energy storage systems such as pumped storage projects (PSP) and battery energy storage systems (BESS), Jain said ""But, I think at the same time, you need someone (market operator) to balance the grid as well. I think from a private side we do that as a service to our clients.""

Engie aims to be an integrated energy solutions player in India, a role the company is playing effectively in various mature markets across the globe.

You can see 119 wind turbines scattered across the landscape from the highest point on sheep grazier Brent Finlay's southern Queensland property. Within a few months, there will be 162; within a decade, with another gigantic project proposed next door, about 350.

And that's just to the north. In every other direction, Finlay says with a sweep of his hand, wind developers are knocking on farmers' doors.

""People either like wind turbines or they don't like them. It's quite polarising,"" says Finlay, once president of the National Farmers' Federation and now chair of the government's centrepiece drought policy, the Future Drought Fund. He says the view ""doesn't really worry me"".

At least 30 turbines are located on Finlay's land. For him and the nine other landowners hosting the MacIntyre windfarm, it is a financial lifeline.

The project is the largest onshore windfarm in the southern hemisphere and spreads some 36,000 hectares of rocky grazing country south of the rural town of Karara, about 200km south-west of Brisbane. Five years ago it suffered its worst drought in living memory.

""Income diversification is critical for long-term survival in Australian agriculture,"" Finlay says. ""What we hear in the predictions are larger droughts, longer droughts, deeper droughts into the future.""

Governments may have their sights on renewable energy - critical for reducing reliance on fossil fuels in order to curb the worst of global heating - but for farmers, it's more about about surviving it at all.

The deal struck by the group of landowners and the windfarm's developer, Spanish renewable energy giant Acciona, is confidential, but lobby group Farmers for Climate Action has said annual payments to farmers average $40,000 a turbine.

That estimate would put total compensation, shared between the 10 landowners, at $162m over the project's 25-year lease agreement. It is a potentially significant additional income alongside earnings from their wool and meat operations that can coexist with turbines humming overhead.

Finlay calls himself a ""renewable energy farmer"", but not everyone is convinced.

""Everyone over there has got turbines and I don't begrudge that,"" says grazier Scott Tait.

Tait runs cattle on a property at Karara but lives outside the area. ""If we were offered the opportunity to host turbines I suppose we'd take it too,"" he says.

From a hill on his property, which Tait says he planned to build a house on, the blades of half a dozen MacIntyre turbines poke above a distant stand of eucalypts. Tait says Acciona representatives assured him the turbines wouldn't be visible from his house site.

The new development on Acciona's books, Herries Range, will see turbines built in the other direction. The rapidly expanding landscape of steel towers and fibreglass blades that stretch 285m into the sky has left Tait saying he feels powerless. And unlike his neighbours who host turbines, he had not received any compensation.

It is this group of people - neighbours, not hosts - who are showing a growing resentment toward the renewable energy boom. French energy company Engie this week announced a plan to offer a $1,000 rebate on energy bills to those who live near its solar and wind developments in an effort to build support.

""If this is the way we have to go, if this is the future, there needs to be a better system of taking into account the impact on small rural communities,"" Tait says.

In a statement, an Acciona spokesperson said Tait's land is more than 5km from the nearest turbine and the company will continue to engage with him about his concerns while ""discussing potential impact and mitigation"".

Mitigating the impact on rural communities is a concern in renewable energy developments across the country, says former national energy infrastructure commissioner Andrew Dyer. Neighbour agreements - compensation for landowners who don't host turbines themselves but are close to properties that do - can allay concerns.

""It means neighbours can then be part of the winning team rather than the losing team,"" Dyer tells Guardian Australia.

A review authored by Dyer found Australia's renewable energy rollout had created a ""material distrust"" of energy developers due to a lack of community engagement. The government has committed $20.7m to implementing its recommendations.

""It's the fear of the unknown that often drives tension and concern, that's fair enough, we'd all be concerned,"" Dyer says. Decreases in the land value of neighbouring properties is another major concern, but there is ""limited to no evidence"" this eventuates, he says.

Down the road from the windfarm, Elizabeth and Andrew Galeraith are renovating the Karara taven & motel which they bought last month. The roadside pub's revenue has tripled since construction began.

""If you want the area to grow and develop, then MacIntyre has been really positive,"" Andrew says. ""If you want it to stay as a small rural community, then it's not. It depends on your values ... we want it to thrive.""

Two weeks ago, about 50 people gathered into a community centre in Greymare, Queensland in opposition to a prospective windfarm in the area. Among the crowd were state Liberal MP James Lister, who took their concerns to parliament.

Unlike the vast land holdings that host the MacIntyre windfarm, Greymare is dotted with retirees and tree-changers on small hobby farms.

The meeting was organised by Rose Uwins and Lindy Bennett, who moved to the area from Melbourne. ""We have not had one iota of consultation, we have not been able to have a say, we have not been able to have an opinion,"" Bennett says.

It's not the only community with concerns: last week the South Burnett regional council unanimously called for a moratorium on renewable energy projects until strict conditions are met.

Opposition to renewable developments ranges from the lack of consultation; the visual impact; localised environmental impacts; increases in traffic; and increased pressure on an already stretched rental market.

MacIntyre's construction workforce peaked at about 750 last year. The majority lived in an on-site workers' camp, but some lived in the nearby town of Warwick in the Southern Downs regional council. The mayor, Melissa Hamilton, says it has had an impact on housing availability.

""A lot of families who could afford rent before have found themselves homeless,"" she says.

Wind developers are required to pay rates to local councils of roughly $10,000 per turbine. According to Acciona, the MacIntyre project has so far poured $678m into Queensland businesses, will employ up to 40 people and distribute $250,000 in community grants annually once operational and is supported by 58% of locals. The company said they could ""learn from"" the housing issue.

At Greymare, some locals who have watched the MacIntyre development are arguing in support of the economic benefit of hosting a windfarm in their community, too.

From a ridge on David Lawler's Greymare property, the silhouettes of MacIntyre's wind turbines pierce the horizon like matchsticks. Lawler is one of about 25 farmers in early talks with a renewable energy developer.

Hosting turbines would make for a comfortable retirement for Lawler, a secure income for his two sons and potential local jobs.

""Not everyone wants their kids to have to go away and work,"" Lawler says. ""We've got to think of the benefit to the whole community.""",theguardian.com,news,The Guardian,Aston Brown,0.1764705882352942,454604910,1,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0199eb626a3c4ddc72913ce123599e35479bdd57/0_227_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=ddd3557ce9a53158bf1bbe7ffac6aa41,

Already the Federal Government through the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) is seeking local and international investors and renewable energy projects developers to take advantage of the huge investment opportunities existing in the $9.2 billion rural electrification market in Nigeria.

The Agency has just signed a 250 megawatts (mw) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Husk Power Group as it scales up and opening up more for transparency and for business to encourage more investors and developers to come into the rural electrification space in the country.

The REA is currently implementing the Distributed Access Through Renewable Energy Scale-Up (DARES) Project for Nigeria to increase access to electricity services for households and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) with private sector led distributed renewable energy generation.

Renewable energy capacity in Africa has almost doubled in the last decade, but it's not enough.

A recent study from Climate Analytics indicates that Africa needs $100 billion a year in climate finance five times current investment levels to meet the renewable energy goals agreed at COP28.

As investors from nearly 90 countries around the world prepare to arrive in Barcelona for AEF24,, Simon Gosling, EnergyNet, said,

""The private sector has already demonstrated its willingness to commit billions to projects, but projects still aren't moving fast enough.

""It's the industrialised nations that will be most affected if Africa cannot significantly increase its electrification rates and unlock the investment landscape that is inhibiting proven private sector players.

""World food security, access to minerals, textiles, and industrial growth are critical to future economic growth, health, and sustainability. With Africa forecast to be home to a quarter of the world's population under 25 years by 2050, red tape must be reduced, and projects must start happening at scale and pace.""

This year's theme, 'Energy Systems for the Future - Balancing Africa's Needs with Global Goals' is set to tackle these barriers head on.

Public and private sector stakeholders will spend almost a full half-day together, behind closed doors, discussing the challenges both sides are facing. All attending ministers and Vice Presidents, as well as heads of utilities (national and municipal), regulatory bodies, DFIs, and private investors, will be in the room.

The new Corporate Leadership Roundtable will also give private sector developers and investors a platform to debate the opportunities and challenges they face in moving projects forward, sparking vital discussions before they meet with Ministers and utilities to establish an improved path for Africa's energy sector.

This innovative format will create the most high-level sessions ever held at the Africa Energy Forum, where business leaders can spend exclusive, quality time with public sector counterparts.

Key topics on the agenda across the four days include the potential of hydrogen on the continent; grid management; energy storage and distribution; the future roles of gas and mining; advancing renewable energy projects, distributed power, and commercial and industrial (C&I) projects to accelerate universal access; navigating power markets; and Africa's broader energy transition.

More than 33 Ministers and 100 high-level public sector officials from across Africa will travel to Spain for the 26th edition of the Africa Energy Forum (aef), 25-28 June, at the Fira de Montjuïc, Barcelona.

With Spain's commitment of $2.3 billion in funding to South Africa and its recently announced support for green hydrogen projects in Mauritania, the country joins France, Germany, Italy, the EU and the UK as European nations step up their commitment to clean energy development in the African continent.

Among the nearly 2,500 delegates attending, an unprecedented number of ministers from across Africa will be in attendance, including Ministers from Nigeria, Egypt, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Togo, Gabon, Central African Republic and Zambia.

""As specialists in renewable energy with transformative projects in Nigeria and Angola, for the second consecutive year, we are proud to be the forum sponsor of this imperative event for Africa."" said Adam Cortese, CEO, Sun Africa.

Wale Shonibare, Director, Energy Finance Solutions, Policy & Regulations, African Development Bank (AfDB), added: ""The African Development Bank's participation at the Africa Energy Forum underscores our commitment to sustained dialogue, collaboration, and partnerships to transform the energy landscape across Africa.

""In Barcelona, the Bank will showcase initiatives aimed at innovating finance, delivering technical assistance, and mobilizing investments to achieve universal access to modern, affordable, and reliable energy in Africa.""

The lender syndicate includes Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Al Ahli Bank of Kuwait, Ahli United Bank, Arab Bank, Bank ABC, ABC Islamic Bank, Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation (Apicorp), Al Salam Bank, Banque Saudi Fransi, Boubyan Bank, Gulf International Bank, Kuwait Finance House - Bahrain, Mashreqbank, National Bank of Kuwait-Bahrain Branch, Société Générale, Standard Chartered Bank and Warba Bank.

Al Dur Power and Water Company is a joint venture between Engie, Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC), Kyushu Electric Power Company (Kyuden) and the Social Insurance Organisation (SIO).

The Al Dur IWPP is a cornerstone power project in Bahrain, contributing significantly to the country's power and water production capacity. The plant boasts a capacity of 1,234 megawatts (MW) of power and 48 million imperial gallons per day (MIGD) of water.

It operates under a 25-year power and water purchase agreement with the Electricity and Water Authority (EWA). Commercial operations commenced in early 2012, with the official inauguration following in April of the same year.

Investors eagerly await details on a planned licensing action for offshore wind projects, which was initially announced by the previous administration.

In the country's first offshore wind auction, the previous government offered a capacity of 2 gigawatts (GW), but the current government has not confirmed whether it will maintain or adjust this capacity. The timing of the auction remains uncertain.

Carvalho assured that policy directions will be revealed before the summer break, with a formal announcement expected in July. Portugal already boasts a 25-megawatt floating wind project off its Atlantic coast, owned by Ocean Winds -- a joint venture between Portugal's utility EDP and French company Engie.

Several utilities have expressed interest in the upcoming auction, including Germany's BayWa, the Irish-Spanish consortium IberBlue Wind, fund manager Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, and a joint venture between Portugal's Galp and France's TotalEnergies.

Floating wind farms, positioned in deep waters with stronger and more consistent winds, offer greater power generation potential compared to fixed seabed installations near the shore or on land.

Lamprell, which was in charge of the construction of the transition pieces for the 882 MW offshore wind farm, delivered the project on schedule and within budget.

Global Energy Group (GEG) provided preassembly support services for the marshalling of 62 TPs at the Port of Nigg.

""This achievement highlights the effectiveness of our industry-leading serial production line, which was designed to meet the growing demands of the offshore wind sector, and showcases the exceptional skills of our employees. This landmark project, which started in 2022 following the project award, involved the construction of 60 wind turbine generator TPs and two offshore substation TPs,"" Lamprell said on social media.

Ocean Winds, a joint venture between Engie and EDP Renewables, is developing the Moray West project.

The wind farm will be equipped with 60 SG 14-222 DD offshore wind turbines to be supplied by Siemens Gamesa.

The first 14.7 MW turbine has been installed in April 2024, with the wind turbine installation campaign set to continue for most of the rest of 2024, Ocean Winds said.

MILAN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

On the occasion of the Energiapura Series 2024, held on Saturday 25 May, NHOA Group (Paris:NHOA), as part of its social commitment, announced the partnership under the banner of sustainability with Energiapura and the expansion of NHOA Ski Team project from Piedmont to Friuli Venezia Giulia.

NHOA Group has people at the center of its sustainability strategy and promotes through NHOA Ã‰lite Program physical wellbeing, sports, and particularly, with NHOA Ski Team, alpine skiing as a powerful educational tool to convey the values of sustainability, passion, commitment, and perseverance, in line with the Group's culture and value framework.

NHOA Ski Team is a one-of-a-kind social and educational project with the ambition to become an educational model on a national level for all the sports clubs that feel the responsibility to nurture young people in a context of excellence, balance, and inclusion.

Accordingly, NHOA Group has chosen to support Martina Vozza and her guide Ylenia Sabidussi in their journey in the Paralympic Alpine Skiing World Cup.

In this context, NHOA Ski Team is expanding nationally, particularly in Friuli Venezia Giulia, with the NHOA Ski Team Tarvisio. The co-founders Tiziana Candoni, along with Massimo and Andrea Lazzaro, aim to continue the Ã©lite planning developed during the years of management and successes of the Bachmann Sport College and continued with the Tarvisio Racing Team.

Clubs joining NHOA Ski Team project at the Italian level retain their autonomy and their independence but embracing the project's values and the technical direction of the program under Alessandro Serra's guidance alongside Katia Santus, they will benefit from the unique and innovative services of the NHOA Ã‰lite Program available to all athletes, coaches, and families.

Within this context, in order to represent the plurality of interests and perspectives, from the Western Alps to Friuli Venezia Giulia, NHOA Ski Team at the Italian association level will be chaired by Tiziana Candoni with the support of Luca Mantovani, Alessandro Serra, Andrea Lazzaro, and Carlalberto Guglielminotti.

Energiapura joins this project as a partner for the benefit of all NHOA Group people and their families and as the main apparel partner of NHOA Ski Team, for all athletes from any ski club in Italy that join the project.

""Alpine skiing is a powerful educational tool to impart the values of passion, commitment, and perseverance to young people, but, above all, it is an unmissable opportunity to direct an entire system, the next generation, towards what matters most: sustainability"", commented Carlalberto Guglielminotti, Founder and CEO of NHOA Group.

These values and attention to sustainability and inclusion were the meeting point between NHOA and Energiapura, which also stands out for its constant and concrete commitment to producing recycled or recyclable products and continuous research for technologically advanced innovative materials, resulting from collaborations with top World Cup athletes, including Lucas Braathen, Alice Robinson, and Henrik Kristoffersen.

Energiapura, like NHOA, is at the forefront of fighting climate change and inequalities, and from today, the two entities share the common goal of unleashing the potential of new generations by leaving them a greener and more inclusive planet.

""I am grateful and honored to represent this ambitious project that encompasses everything that skiing and sports in general need today. We are living in a delicate and difficult period; we can overcome everything only by working together, embracing sharing, sustainability, and education. Culture and sports must travel the same path, and those who lead must have clear ideas on how to steer the system for the growth of clubs, families, and especially our young and adult athletes. Making my experience in school and technical fields available to everyone will be my priority. I thank NHOA Group for giving me this opportunity"", commented Tiziana Candoni, President of NHOA Ski Teams at the Italian level.

Energiapura is the name that has represented my vision since the inception of my company. As a sports enthusiast and mountain lover, I have always loved and respected the environment, bringing this lifestyle and these values into the corporate system and products. This is how Energiapura's recycled and recyclable technical garments are born, made from the recovery of plastic bottles. It can and must be done: and Energiapura has made the responsibility towards the future of young people tangible and concrete. I believe that the meeting and collaboration with NHOA is no coincidence: sport, company, system, and responsibility unite us. A powerful energy that will be talked about, commented Alberto Olivetto, CEO of Energiapura.

On the occasion of the Energiapura Series 2024, held on Saturday 25 May, NHOA Group (Paris:NHOA), as part of its social commitment, announced the partnership under the banner of sustainability with Energiapura and the expansion of NHOA Ski Team project from Piedmont to Friuli Venezia Giulia.

NHOA Group has people at the center of its sustainability strategy and promotes through NHOA Élite Program physical wellbeing, sports, and particularly, with NHOA Ski Team, alpine skiing as a powerful educational tool to convey the values of sustainability, passion, commitment, and perseverance, in line with the Group's culture and value framework.

NHOA Ski Team is a one-of-a-kind social and educational project with the ambition to become an educational model on a national level for all the sports clubs that feel the responsibility to nurture young people in a context of excellence, balance, and inclusion.

Accordingly, NHOA Group has chosen to support Martina Vozza and her guide Ylenia Sabidussi in their journey in the Paralympic Alpine Skiing World Cup.

In this context, NHOA Ski Team is expanding nationally, particularly in Friuli Venezia Giulia, with the NHOA Ski Team Tarvisio. The co-founders Tiziana Candoni, along with Massimo and Andrea Lazzaro, aim to continue the élite planning developed during the years of management and successes of the Bachmann Sport College and continued with the Tarvisio Racing Team.

Clubs joining NHOA Ski Team project at the Italian level retain their autonomy and their independence but embracing the project's values and the technical direction of the program under Alessandro Serra's guidance alongside Katia Santus, they will benefit from the unique and innovative services of the NHOA Élite Program available to all athletes, coaches, and families.

Within this context, in order to represent the plurality of interests and perspectives, from the Western Alps to Friuli Venezia Giulia, NHOA Ski Team at the Italian association level will be chaired by Tiziana Candoni with the support of Luca Mantovani, Alessandro Serra, Andrea Lazzaro, and Carlalberto Guglielminotti.

Energiapura joins this project as a partner for the benefit of all NHOA Group people and their families and as the main apparel partner of NHOA Ski Team, for all athletes from any ski club in Italy that join the project.

""Alpine skiing is a powerful educational tool to impart the values of passion, commitment, and perseverance to young people, but, above all, it is an unmissable opportunity to direct an entire system, the next generation, towards what matters most: sustainability"", commented Carlalberto Guglielminotti, Founder and CEO of NHOA Group.

These values and attention to sustainability and inclusion were the meeting point between NHOA and Energiapura, which also stands out for its constant and concrete commitment to producing recycled or recyclable products and continuous research for technologically advanced innovative materials, resulting from collaborations with top World Cup athletes, including Lucas Braathen, Alice Robinson, and Henrik Kristoffersen.

Energiapura, like NHOA, is at the forefront of fighting climate change and inequalities, and from today, the two entities share the common goal of unleashing the potential of new generations by leaving them a greener and more inclusive planet.

""I am grateful and honored to represent this ambitious project that encompasses everything that skiing and sports in general need today. We are living in a delicate and difficult period; we can overcome everything only by working together, embracing sharing, sustainability, and education. Culture and sports must travel the same path, and those who lead must have clear ideas on how to steer the system for the growth of clubs, families, and especially our young and adult athletes. Making my experience in school and technical fields available to everyone will be my priority. I thank NHOA Group for giving me this opportunity"", commented Tiziana Candoni, President of NHOA Ski Teams at the Italian level.

""Energiapura is the name that has represented my vision since the inception of my company. As a sports enthusiast and mountain lover, I have always loved and respected the environment, bringing this lifestyle and these values into the corporate system and products. This is how Energiapura's recycled and recyclable technical garments are born, made from the recovery of plastic bottles. It can and must be done: and Energiapura has made the responsibility towards the future of young people tangible and concrete. I believe that the meeting and collaboration with NHOA is no coincidence: sport, company, system, and responsibility unite us. A powerful ""energy"" that will be talked about"", commented Alberto Olivetto, CEO of Energiapura.

Al Dur Power & Water Company is owned by a consortium comprising French utility major Engie, Kuwait-based Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC), Japanese group Kyushu Electric Power Company (Kyuden) and the Social Insurance Organisation (SIO).

The lenders and hedge providers, via conventional and Islamic facilities, include Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Al Ahli Bank of Kuwait, Ahli United Bank, Arab Bank, Bank ABC, ABC Islamic Bank, Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation (Apicorp), Al Salam Bank, Banque Saudi Fransi, Boubyan Bank, Gulf International Bank, Kuwait Finance House (Bahrain), Mashreqbank, National Bank of Kuwait - Bahrain Branch, Société Générale, Standard Chartered Bank and, Warba Bank.

The refinancing facilities extend up to 11 years and include a $643 million conventional facility and a $557 million Islamic facility involving a wide range of commercial lenders active in the European and Middle Eastern project finance markets.

The new facilities allow the company to refinance its existing project-level debt on terms reflecting the status of the project as an asset with no construction risk and a proven operating history.

The Al Dur IWPP is a flagship power project in Bahrain, accounting for a significant portion of the country's power and water production, with a capacity of 1.23 GW in respect of power and 48 MIGD in respect of water per day.

The company benefits from a 25-year power and water purchase agreement entered into with EWA. Commercial operations started in early 2012 and the plant was officially inaugurated in April 2012 by His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and the late Prime Minister HRH Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa.

It's the brick wall that renewable energy projects have been running into for more than a decade - community opposition. Now French utilities giant Engie has turned to one of the few levers that seem to yield results: cold hard financial benefits for the families and businesses that will have their views disturbed by one of its new wind turbines near Hay, NSW.

Engie will offer an annual electricity rebate of $1000 for residents and businesses within 20 kilometres of its huge The Plains renewables development, which could have as many as 188 wind turbines and nearly 1 million solar panels. It will roll the scheme out to all its future renewable energy assets in the country.

Richard Cannon owns a grazing and irrigation property south of Hay, where some of Engie's turbines will be located. He said the area was a good spot for wind farms and solar panels. ""You can put a huge footprint on a large amount of land with a few landholders,"" he said. ""The disruption aesthetically is tied to those people.""

Mr Cannon said the community concern was understandable. ""You can be a long way from a wind farm and still have the visual impact,"" he said. In Hay, there were plenty of negotiations. Mr Cannon said that was primarily about guarding against problems when the turbines are decommissioned and minimising disruption to agriculture.

If only other towns were so open-minded. Dozens of community groups are pushing back against renewable energy projects - for a range of reasons, from their impact on the environment to the effect on property prices. The Australian Financial Review reported late last year that not a single wind farm in NSW had been granted planning approval for 28 months running. Renewable energy developers had begun to worry that, if something was not done, any chance of reaching the 2030 climate goals would disappear.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.1764705882352942,454446201,10,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1907%2C$multiply_4%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/fa11617b82647476dead1089e9f5a5300679ba9e,

Multinational companies who struck lucrative agreements to develop vast offshore wind farms as part of Scotland's landmark renewable energy venture have been accused of ""outrageous hypocrisy"" and complicity in Ukraine's suffering by maintaining extensive business ties with major Russian fossil fuel projects. Several developers involved in the flagship ScotWind initiative continue to hold stakes in Russian firms that have been subjected to sanctions by the UK and US governments, with one maintaining a significant shareholding in a Siberian facility that supplies the vast majority of Europe's imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Firms set to build massive windfarms off Scotland must not fund 'Putin's war chest' - Scotsman comment. More than two years after Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, companies should have done more to disentangle themselves from the Russian economy. Several multinational companies set to develop massive windfarms off Scotland's coast still have extensive business ties with major Russian fossil fuel projects. Some even hold stakes in Russian firms that are the subject of sanctions by the UK and US governments. Svitlana Romanko, of Ukrainian campaign group Razom We Stand, which is calling for a total embargo on Russian fossil fuels, told The Scotsman that Russian assets held by the companies involved were ""directly contributing to the continuing destruction in Ukraine"". ""These companies are effectively funding Putin's war chest, enabling his destruction of Ukraine and contributing to the death of thousands of innocent Ukrainians,"" she said.

Scotsman 26th May 2024 read more ""

he three companies who continue to hold Russian assets while pursuing major renewable projects as part of ScotWind projects are all major energy players. The French energy giant, TotalEnergies, which posted record profits of £16.8 billion last year, holds a 38 per cent stake in the consortium behind the West of Orkney offshore wind farm, one of the most advanced ScotWind projects, which could become operational as soon as 2029. Engie, another French company involved in ScotWind, is also a global energy brand, with upwards of 100,000 staff. It posted profits of £1.8bn last year.

Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence helped drive a rally across equity markets in 2023, propelling Nvidia and Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML (ASML.AS) into the spotlight.

Nvidia shares are hovering close to record highs ahead of its quarterly earnings due late on Wednesday. However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index (.SX6P) has risen over 9 per cent, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7 per cent rise in the main STOXX 600 (.STOXX) index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2 per cent versus a 9 per cent rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum (FORTUM.HE), Verbund (VERB.VI) and renewables supplier EDP (EDP.LS), to larger players like RWE (RWEG.DE), Iberdrola (IBE.MC), Enel (ENEI.MI) and Engie (ENGIE.PA).

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange (LSEG.L), information and analytics group RELX (REL.L) and software group Sage (SGE.L) as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big US names behind the technology.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) have shot up 33 per cent-41 per cent.

Meanwhile, some European companies have been quietly using AI to develop new products that are already benefiting their customers, said Stotzel.

""This has resulted in the European-listed beneficiaries trading at more attractive valuations,"" he said, listing German software company SAP (SAPG.DE) and Swiss drugmaker Roche (ROG.S) among those his team are focused on to play the AI theme.

Miners are another area of investor interest, particularly for copper , which has hit record highs above $11,000 a metric ton this week, spurred largely by a shortage of material for prompt delivery.

Commodity trader Trafigura believes copper demand linked to data centres and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030 and exacerbate supply deficits towards the end of the decade.

Enables energy and utility companies to confidently embrace modern data and analytics capabilities

Denodo, a leader in data management, announced that the company is expanding its efforts to provide energy and utility companies with the necessary data management capabilities to gain advanced capabilities and meet new renewable energy requirements, all while remaining in compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory demands.

Facing numerous challenges, including generating, managing, and consuming new, decarbonized and increasingly digitized sources of energy; maintaining resilience and sustainability in a time of change; developing new technologies such as virtual power plants (VPPs) based on intelligent operations; all while managing a rising number of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability initiatives; energy and utility companies need to be able to manage data so that it helps to overcome these challenges, rather than adding to them.

The Denodo Platform facilitates this by providing real-time access to data across myriad distributed energy resources, while enabling the establishment of a unified semantic layer over all data sources, to deliver data when it is needed, in the language required by each data consumer. This provides energy and utility companies with the foundation to overcome myriad known and unknown challenges. The Denodo Platform enables such capabilities as continuous monitoring and control, and makes it possible for VPP operators to make fast, informed decisions in response to changes in energy demand, pricing, and environmental conditions. By enabling such capabilities, the Denodo Platform provides energy and utility companies with a reliable foundation for innovation.

Denodo has a strong heritage in providing impactful data management solutions to energy and utility companies, such as VTTI, a Netherlands-based energy storage and developer of critical energy infrastructure; BHP, a global resources company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia; Engie Mexico, an energy company that is committed to bringing energy to the people of Mexico; and Suez, a French multinational corporation with operations in water, electricity, natural gas supply, and waste management.

Hans Geurts, chief information officer for VTTI, says, ""As a rapidly growing organization in an uncertain geopolitical environment, laying a strong data foundation was critical for us to become data-driven. The Denodo Platform has helped us in simplifying and standardizing our data infrastructure, while boosting our business resilience."" The Denodo Platform acts as VTTI's single source of truth for enterprise resource planning (ERP) data. The company leverages it to synthesize, combine, and analyze operational insights to improve ways of working and address inefficiencies in the operational micro-steps at the company's terminals. It also helps VTTI to visualize and understand product trade flows through the terminals and various modes of transport, helping VTTI's commercial teams to better serve customers.

Joshua Fletcher, superintendent HSE, Reporting at BHP, made similar statements about the effect that the Denodo Platform had on the company's business. ""The Denodo Platform helps us to reduce the overall size of the data sets that need to be moved over the network. It helped us to create a logical data fabric that makes our data assets reusable and can be consumed by users spread across the globe.""

Luis Guadarrama, senior manager, Data Analytics and Innovation at Engie Mexico, says, ""The Denodo Platform delivers data quickly and easily, which helps us to deliver value to the business and democratize data access. Our business users might not understand the technical part, but they do understand that there's something called 'the Denodo Platform' that helps them to connect to data in an easier way, to make better decisions."" Engie Mexico leveraged the Denodo Platform to enable a variety of strategic initiatives, including web services that help hundreds of thousands of customers to balance their use of natural gas, chatbots that assist in problem resolution, and machine learning (ML) algorithms that analyze the behavior patterns of business-to-consumer gas customers.

Denodo believes that VPPs are the power plants of the future. VPPs can run energy in the cloud, and they can supply renewable energy on-demand, through innovative web-based interfaces that can remotely link and manage homes with solar and battery storage. Additionally, VPPs can feed power back to the grid during peak times, to relieve the load and keep the network stable.

Denodo also believes that data-driven, intelligent operations is a critical capability that can greatly assist utility CIOs in designing fit-for-the-future assets that bridge physical and digital phenomena. The Denodo Platform facilitates the development of intelligent operations and VPPs through diverse capabilities, including distributed energy resource management, predictive analytics for maintenance, and optimization of energy assets.

""Advanced data management technology will be essential in enabling new capabilities that oil and gas companies need to thrive, both now and beyond the energy transition,"" said Paul Moxon, SVP Data Architecture and Chief Evangelist at Denodo. ""Power plants of the future will operate in an eco-centric, distributed manner, enabling the data-driven, intelligent VPPs of the future. The Denodo Platform, with its ability to provide real-time data access to increasingly diverse data sources, will underpin success by providing energy and utility business users with access to data at the speed of business.""

Their technology captures, purifies, and liquefies CO2 from biogas produced through anaerobic digestion.

This process creates liquid biogenic CO2, which can replace fossil CO2 in industries such as food and beverage and synthetic fuel production.

In a statement published Tuesday, CryoCollect's CEO and co-founder, Haytham Sayah, expressed excitement about the partnership with Engie and GTT, highlighting their commitment to accelerating the energy transition.

Sayah noted the synergy between CryoCollect's technology and Engie's activities in biogas production, bio liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG), and industrial energy efficiency.

Biogas, derived from organic waste in anaerobic digesters at waste facilities or landfill sites, is processed into biomethane or bio-LNG.

Biomethane, with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil natural gas, supports the decarbonization of sectors like road transport and heavy industry without requiring new infrastructure.

Johann Boukhors at Engie New Ventures emphasized the strategic fit of CryoCollect in their investment portfolio, marking it as the third biogas-related investment and the first in carbon management.

In turn, Camille Bonenfant-Jeanneney at Engie Renewable Gases Europe praised the energy-efficient carbon capture technology developed by CryoCollect, calling it ""the new standard of the biogas industry"".",carbonherald.com,news,Carbon Herald,Theodora Stankova,0.1372549019607843,454261556,15,https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CryoCollect-logo.png,

The Denodo Platform facilitates this by providing real-time access to data across myriad distributed energy resources, while enabling the establishment of a unified semantic layer over all data sources, to deliver data when it is needed, in the language required by each data consumer. This provides energy and utility companies with the foundation to overcome myriad known and unknown challenges. The Denodo Platform enables such capabilities as continuous monitoring and control, and makes it possible for VPP operators to make fast, informed decisions in response to changes in energy demand, pricing, and environmental conditions. By enabling such capabilities, the Denodo Platform provides energy and utility companies with a reliable foundation for innovation.

Denodo has a strong heritage in providing impactful data management solutions to energy and utility companies, such as VTTI, a Netherlands-based energy storage and developer of critical energy infrastructure; BHP, a global resources company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia; Engie Mexico, an energy company that is committed to bringing energy to the people of Mexico; and Suez, a French multinational corporation with operations in water, electricity, natural gas supply, and waste management.

Hans Geurts, chief information officer for VTTI, says, ""As a rapidly growing organization in an uncertain geopolitical environment, laying a strong data foundation was critical for us to become data-driven. The Denodo Platform has helped us in simplifying and standardizing our data infrastructure, while boosting our business resilience."" The Denodo Platform acts as VTTI's single source of truth for enterprise resource planning (ERP) data. The company leverages it to synthesize, combine, and analyze operational insights to improve ways of working and address inefficiencies in the operational micro-steps at the company's terminals. It also helps VTTI to visualize and understand product trade flows through the terminals and various modes of transport, helping VTTI's commercial teams to better serve customers.

""This is an exciting milestone which we hope will lead to a snowball effect,"" says Eva Zabey, CEO at Business for Nature -- a coalition of NGOs and private-sector organizations launched in 2019 to elevate a business call for comprehensive action to reverse nature loss and restore the planet's vital natural systems. ""All these companies have clearly articulated how they will address their most material impacts and dependencies on nature. We hope these strategies give confidence to others to start their own journey to develop and publish a nature strategy.""

""The more that companies can share and learn from each other, the quicker other companies can develop their own strategies and avoid having to start from scratch,"" she added.

Although momentum on nature conservation and restoration is growing, with global initiatives such as the TNFD and Science-Based Targets for Nature picking up pace across the corporate world, more must be done to make the crucial shift from adoption to implementation of the Biodiversity Plan (also known as the Global Biodiversity Framework) created at COP15 in 2022. By developing a strategy for nature that considers multiple impacts and dependencies across freshwater, land, air, ocean and biodiversity, businesses can reduce their negative impacts and boost business resilience. The plans can also bring new commercial opportunities, create long-term value, and strengthen climate and sustainability goals.

For a nature strategy to be featured as part of the ""It's Now for Nature"" campaign, it should include:

""At Kering, we are proud that our nature strategy is among the first featured as part of 'It's Now for Nature', and we hope this will contribute to the growing momentum of corporate nature action encouraging more companies to develop and publish an ambitious strategy for a nature-positive future,"" said Géraldine Vallejo, Sustainability Program Director at Kering -- which in 2020 unveiled an industry-leading commitment to achieve a net-positive impact on biodiversity by 2025.

For GSK, Sustainability Partnerships and Strategy Director Adele Cheli said creating a strategy for nature made perfect business sense: ""As a healthcare company, we know that nature and health are deeply connected. Our business relies on nature and we use many natural materials to manufacture our products, so there is a very important business-resilience angle for us to consider.""

Business for Nature encourages more businesses to step up their actions to halt and reverse nature loss. Nature strategies submitted to ""It's Now for Nature"" are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with more strategies expected to be featured on the website in the run-up to the UN Biodiversity COP16 in late October. Zabey hopes that the publication of the first five will inspire more companies to get on board.

""The planetary crisis requires us to act with urgency, and we don't have time to hatch the perfect plan,"" Zabey explains. ""However, many companies will already have enough knowledge to take some 'no regrets' actions, and having an imperfect strategy is much better than having none at all.""

Cheli agrees, advising companies not to focus on creating the perfect plan: ""Just get going,"" she says. ""Wherever you are on your data journey, progress is better than perfection -- let's get moving.""",sustainablebrands.com,news,Sustainable Brands,Sustainable Brands,0.2784313725490195,454248336,1,https://sb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/production/50259/conversions/production-asset-thumb--gsk-kering-among-companies-setting-bar-for-nature-strategies-2024-05-23-63527456e9b11469259f9d08187e2505-fbimg.jpg,

Ocean Winds, joint venture between EDP Renewables and ENGIE, has published a report on environmentally safe and predictable UXO disposal at its Moray West offshore wind farm.

A report demonstrates how the ""low-order deflagration"" method for disposal of unexploded ordnance (UXO) creates predictable low levels of underwater noise in the marine environment.

UXO seabed surveys and disposal are standard on offshore infrastructure projects, including offshore wind projects. The report has been compiled following the first large scale use of the method during UXO clearance prior to offshore construction of Moray West, an offshore wind farm in the outer Moray Firth, Scotland, developed by Ocean Winds.

All 82 UXOs identified for disposal were safely disposed of using this technique with the works undertaken by EODEX, a Scottish based innovator bringing this technique to the sector in partnership with Ocean Winds, according to the company.

As reported by lead author Nuria Abad Oliva, Offshore Consents Manager for the project, the technique had previously only been used for military purposes. This was the first successful use of the technique to support offshore renewable developments, with underwater noise measurements made by Seiche Ltd during disposal operations.

Mines, bombs, torpedoes and naval shells with explosive content varying in size from 6 to 700 kgs were successfully neutralized. Underwater noise was limited to the small disposal tool charge, avoiding large underwater explosions from traditional UXO disposal techniques.

The report identifies a key advantage of the technique as being the accuracy of underwater noise modelling and impact assessment compared to less certain and potentially large estimates of noise from traditional disposal techniques. Traditional techniques can cause significant environmental damage and harm marine mammals.

By publishing the outcomes of this study, Ocean Winds hopes that regulators and the offshore wind sector will benefit from these findings about the environmental benefits of low-order deflagration.

""The challenge of disposal of over 80 UXOs using traditional techniques was daunting. Working with EODEX to deploy low-order deflagration for the first time on an offshore wind farm has been fantastic achievement. The disposal resulted in negligible underwater noise and ensured the protection of the prized marine mammal populations in the waters around the project.

""We hope this report will lead to informed guidance from regulators and appropriate adoption of the technique by developers where environmental sensitivities indicate it would be a useful tool,"" said Catarina Rei, Head of Permitting and Environment for Ocean Winds.",oedigital.com,news,Offshore Engineer,,0.2705882352941176,454243752,1,https://images.oedigital.com/images/maritime/w800/retrieved-seabed-credit-ocean-winds-150382.jpg,

It has become Europe's largest technology and innovation event, with CEOs, C-leaders, VCs and startups from all over the world. The lineup of speakers is very impressive, including Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX, X), Robin Li (Baidu), Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO), John Kerry (68th US Secretary of State), Charles Michel (President of the European Council), Marc Pritchard (Chief Brand Officer of P&G), Yoshua Bengio (Professor at the University of Montreal), Dario Amodei (CEO of Antropic), Yann LeCun (Chief AI Scientist at Meta), and Dr. Werner Vogels (CTO of Amazon).

Paris is undoubtedly the perfect place to get a glimpse into the future and discover the latest deep tech, climate tech and mobility innovations. VivaTech offers a unique opportunity to anticipate the profound and fundamental changes that AI and the green market revolution will bring to our economy and society. Whether we like it or not, they are deeply intertwined and will inevitably fundamentally transform our societies and economies, becoming invisibly embedded in every action of our daily lives.

To succeed in AI, you need 1) data, 2) massive investments in infrastructure, and 3) cutting-edge algorithms. I'm not sure if France can truly compete with the US or China on 1 and 2, but if it picks its AI battles, it should focus on algorithms and expertise at the intersection of AI and environmental sustainability. I strongly believe that with its AI expertise and advances in sustainability, France can play a key role at the intersection of AI and environmental issues. Here's why:

French AI research is highly regarded among AI leaders from global companies with French roots. In the past few years, many global companies have opened AI and R&D centers in France. Some companies, such as Ekimetrics, are well-positioned at the intersection of AI and environmental issues. Mistral AI was recently listed by Forrester as one of the leading AI foundation models in language. Investments in AI training are accelerating. President Macron announced a $400 million increase in AI training earlier this week, aiming to have 100,000 AI experts by 2030. Awareness of climate and sustainability issues is higher than in many countries. Initiatives such as Climate Fresk help raise public awareness about climate change. France is making progress in decarbonizing electricity, due to the importance of nuclear power in the energy mix. An AI expert we interviewed said: ""It's hard to imagine how energy-intensive AI will be. In the long run, it won't work without huge investments in nuclear technology, so few countries will be able to enable it."" Global energy, power and environmental services companies are headquartered in France. Examples include EDF, Engie, Legrand, Rexel, Saur, Schneider Electric, Sonepar, Suez, Veolia and Vinci. The startup ecosystem is home to a large number of innovative green tech companies. The new French Tech Next40/120, published this week, highlights this.

French new technology Next40/120

Earlier this week, the French government released the 2024 edition of its French Tech Next40/120, an index based on startups' revenue-generating capacity (the threshold is currently over $40 million) and fundraising ability.

Some facts about the French Tech Next40/120:

According to EY, $8.3bn raised in 2023 (-38.5% compared to 2022), still number one in the European Union (EU) Cumulative revenue of $10.4bn (+30%), of which 36% will come from overseas 40,000 direct jobs Greentech/Agritech is now the number one category ahead of Fintech/Assurtech, Retail, Healthtech and HRtech, with big names such as Contentsquare, Exotec, Ledger, Mirakl, Qonto, Pigment and Voodoo It is interesting to note that of the top 10 companies that have raised the most funding since 2021, there are 4 companies with sustainable initiatives. Verkor (industrial green batteries, $1.2bn), Backmarket (circular economy, $820m), Electra (EV infrastructure, $480m) and Ecovadis (business sustainability assessment, $455m) Other companies to watch in the green tech/agritech/deeptech space include Blablacar, Flying Whales, NW, Waat, Zeplug, Certideal, Vestiaire Collective, Ekwateur, Ilek, Mylight150, Qair, Agriconomie, HappyVore, Innovafeed, La Fourche, Umiami, Ynsect, Deepki, Greenly, Sweep and Umiami.

Don't get me wrong: funding innovation is important, but it's not a panacea.

The hype and interest in unicorns is still excessive. And technological innovation alone is certainly not enough to survive within the boundaries of the nine planets. Low-tech solutions and frugal innovation, regulations and new business models, evolving consumer behavior, and a shift in the mindset of C-leaders are even more important. However, we cannot ignore the fact that green technology can also help.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 24. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region has upheld Gazprom Export's claim against the Czech Republic's CEZ banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

In case of violation of the ban, the court ruled to recover 57.7 mln euro from the Czech company in favor of Gazprom Export.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company CEZ a. s. from continuing proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce <...>.

Hans Geurts, chief information officer for VTTI, says, ""As a rapidly growing organization in an uncertain geopolitical environment, laying a strong data foundation was critical for us to become data-driven. The Denodo Platform has helped us in simplifying and standardizing our data infrastructure, while boosting our business resilience."" The Denodo Platform acts as VTTI's single source of truth for enterprise resource planning (ERP) data. The company leverages it to synthesize, combine, and analyze operational insights to improve ways of working and address inefficiencies in the operational micro-steps at the company's terminals. It also helps VTTI to visualize and understand product trade flows through the terminals and various modes of transport, helping VTTI's commercial teams to better serve customers.

Joshua Fletcher, superintendent HSE, Reporting at BHP, made similar statements about the effect that the Denodo Platform had on the company's business. ""The Denodo Platform helps us to reduce the overall size of the data sets that need to be moved over the network. It helped us to create a logical data fabric that makes our data assets reusable and can be consumed by users spread across the globe.""

Luis Guadarrama, senior manager, Data Analytics and Innovation at Engie Mexico, says, ""The Denodo Platform delivers data quickly and easily, which helps us to deliver value to the business and democratize data access. Our business users might not understand the technical part, but they do understand that there's something called 'the Denodo Platform' that helps them to connect to data in an easier way, to make better decisions."" Engie Mexico leveraged the Denodo Platform to enable a variety of strategic initiatives, including web services that help hundreds of thousands of customers to balance their use of natural gas, chatbots that assist in problem resolution, and machine learning (ML) algorithms that analyze the behavior patterns of business-to-consumer gas customers.

Denodo believes that VPPs are the power plants of the future. VPPs can run energy in the cloud, and they can supply renewable energy on-demand, through innovative web-based interfaces that can remotely link and manage homes with solar and battery storage. Additionally, VPPs can feed power back to the grid during peak times, to relieve the load and keep the network stable.

Denodo also believes that data-driven, intelligent operations is a critical capability that can greatly assist utility CIOs in designing fit-for-the-future assets that bridge physical and digital phenomena. The Denodo Platform facilitates the development of intelligent operations and VPPs through diverse capabilities, including distributed energy resource management, predictive analytics for maintenance, and optimization of energy assets.

""Advanced data management technology will be essential in enabling new capabilities that oil and gas companies need to thrive, both now and beyond the energy transition,"" said Paul Moxon, SVP Data Architecture and Chief Evangelist at Denodo. ""Power plants of the future will operate in an eco-centric, distributed manner, enabling the data-driven, intelligent VPPs of the future. The Denodo Platform, with its ability to provide real-time data access to increasingly diverse data sources, will underpin success by providing energy and utility business users with access to data at the speed of business.""

Enables energy and utility companies to confidently embrace modern data and analytics capabilities

Denodo, a leader in data management, announced that the company is expanding its efforts to provide energy and utility companies with the necessary data management capabilities to gain advanced capabilities and meet new renewable energy requirements, all while remaining in compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory demands.

Facing numerous challenges, including generating, managing, and consuming new, decarbonized and increasingly digitized sources of energy; maintaining resilience and sustainability in a time of change; developing new technologies such as virtual power plants (VPPs) based on intelligent operations; all while managing a rising number of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability initiatives; energy and utility companies need to be able to manage data so that it helps to overcome these challenges, rather than adding to them.

The Denodo Platform facilitates this by providing real-time access to data across myriad distributed energy resources, while enabling the establishment of a unified semantic layer over all data sources, to deliver data when it is needed, in the language required by each data consumer. This provides energy and utility companies with the foundation to overcome myriad known and unknown challenges. The Denodo Platform enables such capabilities as continuous monitoring and control, and makes it possible for VPP operators to make fast, informed decisions in response to changes in energy demand, pricing, and environmental conditions. By enabling such capabilities, the Denodo Platform provides energy and utility companies with a reliable foundation for innovation.

The project encompasses two of the district's locations, marking a significant step towards reducing energy costs, environmental impact, and advancing STEM education within the district.

The cornerstone of this project is the installation of solar panels that will empower the district to hedge against rising energy costs while significantly reducing its carbon footprint. The solar installation will enable the district to self-generate approximately 90 percent of its electricity consumption from on-site renewables.

""JSUSD has made substantial progress towards its sustainable energy and environmental goals, thanks to the support of ENGIE,"" said JSUSD Superintendent Charles Miller. ""This collaborative initiative has been made possible through the utilization of Inflation Recovery Act (IRA) funding, enabling the installation of solar and lighting solutions at three district locations.""

""In addition to these environmental benefits, ENGIE is dedicated to supporting student achievement in STEM,"" said Jean-François Chartrain, Managing Director, Energy Solutions Americas at ENGIE. ""As part of the collaboration, ENGIE is providing valuable educational opportunities to JSUSD students through two student internships. This commitment to STEM enrichment demonstrates ENGIE's dedication to not only advancing clean energy solutions but also fostering the educational growth of the next generation.""

Mike Maudsley joined enfinium as chief executive officer in 2022. He has over 30 years of experience across the power and utility sector, and was most recently responsible for leading all operating assets at Drax plc. Prior to Drax, he spent six years in the Middle East with Engie.

BusinessGreen: What was your first role in the green economy and what attracted you to the sector?

Philip Curds: Before joining the waste sector, I worked for over 30 years in power generation. I have managed a range of power stations from hydropower, combined heat and power, biomass and more. Just before moving to enfinium, I was group operations director for Drax responsible for its UK plants.

This means that, in some ways, I have approached the waste sector with a slightly different set of experiences and a different outlook.

The reason I took this job is because I see a huge potential for the energy from waste sector to pioneer new technologies such as carbon capture. Similar to my time working at the hydropower stations, when that technology was new and innovative, what we are trying to achieve at enfinium feels equally groundbreaking.

What parts of the green economy are you most excited about?

I hugely excited about the developments in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology - a technology that is rightly garnering significant attention at the moment. There are many innovative solutions being developed in the market, and many businesses that are deploying the technology to eliminate emissions.

In July, enfinium will have the first CCS pilot on an energy from waste facility in the UK, supplied by HZI. We will be using it to demonstrate how carbon capture technology can be applied at energy from waste facilities to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. We'll compare different amine solvents and collect data on performance, such as CO2 capture rate, energy consumption, and solvent degradation.

What developments do you think are currently under the radar?

Net zero cannot be achieved unless we removing carbon from the atmosphere to account for the residual emissions from hard to abate sectors. The Climate Change Committee estimates that by 2050, the UK will need around 60 million tonnes of engineered removals of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year to achieve net zero. Currently the UK is producing zero tonnes of engineered removals.

The energy from waste sector has the opportunity to play a significant role in achieving this, which I think is often underappreciated.

Should the UK meet its ambitious waste targets, there will still be around 17 million tonnes of unrecyclable waste to manage every year by 2042. The only way to decarbonise all this unrecyclable waste is to install CCS technology on energy from waste facilities.

Installing CCS will not only decarbonise our unrecyclable waste, but will enable energy from waste plants in the UK to create carbon removals - or negative emissions - and generate carbon negative power. The sector could generate around eight to 10 million tonnes of removals a year - a sixth of the Climate Change Committee target.

The scale of the negative emissions we could generate from waste is certainly under the radar at the moment.

What do you see as the biggest challenges to the net zero transition?

Achieving net zero is no mean feat. It will require lots of difficult decisions to be made and will require every industry to come up with innovative solutions to cut their emissions. However, I'm pleased to see so much attention is being placed on this issue. I'm confident that, through collaboration between government and industry, with the right technology and the necessary investment, we will achieve it.

What advice would you give to someone looking to work in the green economy?

I would encourage young people to work in the green economy. It is an area where you will be able to make a huge positive contribution through your career.

It starts with getting the right skills and training. We run a dedicated three-year apprenticeship programme that combines academic study and practical workshop training with on-the-job, in partnership with the CATCH training facility in the Humber.

You are a finalist at this year's UK Green Business Awards, can you tell us a little bit about your work to advance the green economy?

enfinium is a leading UK energy from waste operator with four operational sites in the UK, in West Yorkshire, Kent and Flintshire, and two in construction.

We divert 2.3 million tonnes of unrecyclable waste from climate-damaging landfill and put it to good use by turning it into home grown energy, enough to power 500,000 UK homes.

Our ambition is to transform our facilities into local 'decarbonisation hubs' powered by the millions of tonnes of unrecyclable waste the UK will produce for decades to come. Using existing energy from waste infrastructure, enfinium could contribute to heat networks, produce electrolytic hydrogen, or use carbon capture technology to provide durable, high quality carbon removals which will be critical for the UK to achieve net zero by 2050.

What projects or achievements are you most proud of?

We recently launched our Net Zero Transition Plan which set out our commitment to achieve net zero across our own operations by 2033, ahead of the industry target of 2040. It also included a timeline to install CCS across our fleet of energy from waste facilities by 2039, producing 1.2 million tonnes of carbon removals each year.

We are already taking steps to progress this plan. From July, we will have the first live CCS trial at an energy from waste facility. We have also submitted a bid as part of the UK Government's CCS Cluster Programme for our facility in North Wales, Parc Adfer.

I am proud of all the hard work by our team at enfinium that goes towards progressing our Net Zero Transition Plan.

Enables energy and utility companies to confidently embrace modern data and analytics capabilities

Denodo, a leader in data management, announced that the company is expanding its efforts to provide energy and utility companies with the necessary data management capabilities to gain advanced capabilities and meet new renewable energy requirements, all while remaining in compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory demands.

Facing numerous challenges, including generating, managing, and consuming new, decarbonized and increasingly digitized sources of energy; maintaining resilience and sustainability in a time of change; developing new technologies such as virtual power plants (VPPs) based on intelligent operations; all while managing a rising number of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability initiatives; energy and utility companies need to be able to manage data so that it helps to overcome these challenges, rather than adding to them.

The Denodo Platform facilitates this by providing real-time access to data across myriad distributed energy resources, while enabling the establishment of a unified semantic layer over all data sources, to deliver data when it is needed, in the language required by each data consumer. This provides energy and utility companies with the foundation to overcome myriad known and unknown challenges. The Denodo Platform enables such capabilities as continuous monitoring and control, and makes it possible for VPP operators to make fast, informed decisions in response to changes in energy demand, pricing, and environmental conditions. By enabling such capabilities, the Denodo Platform provides energy and utility companies with a reliable foundation for innovation.

Denodo has a strong heritage in providing impactful data management solutions to energy and utility companies, such as VTTI, a Netherlands-based energy storage and developer of critical energy infrastructure; BHP, a global resources company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia; Engie Mexico, an energy company that is committed to bringing energy to the people of Mexico; and Suez, a French multinational corporation with operations in water, electricity, natural gas supply, and waste management.

Hans Geurts, chief information officer for VTTI, says, ""As a rapidly growing organization in an uncertain geopolitical environment, laying a strong data foundation was critical for us to become data-driven. The Denodo Platform has helped us in simplifying and standardizing our data infrastructure, while boosting our business resilience.""

- Expected to lead to reduction of carbon dioxide by approx. 40% and nitrogen oxide by 70%

Doosan Enerbility announced on May 21st that it had been awarded a project by the Chilean independent power producer Engie Energia Chile S.A. for the fuel conversion of a thermal power plant in Chile.

The project entails converting the fuel used at the 375MW Infraestructura Energética Mejillones(IEM) power plant in Chile from coal to natural gas. For the fuel conversion, Doosan Enerbility will be installing burners and auxiliary systems made by Doosan itself, ultimately leading to the creation of a natural gas-fired power plant with the same generation capacity as before.

In line with Chile's environmental regulations and the Engie Group's carbon neutrality policy, the plant will continue to be operated using the existing method until 2025. Then, short construction work will be carried out over a period of about six months, which is expected to lead to around a 40 percent reduction of carbon dioxide(CO2) and a 70 percent reduction of nitrogen oxide(NOX).

""Compared to building a new power plant, converting the fuel of existing power plants is an economical low-carbon solution, as we can minimize the plant shutdown time and make maximum use of existing equipment to save on costs,"" said Seungwoo Sohn, CEO of Doosan Enerbility's Power Services Business Group. ""We are committed to doing our best on the project to ensure that our client can be provided with a stable power supply.""

Doosan Enerbility has been continuously engaging in such fuel conversion work for power plants, as can be seen from the agreements signed with three Vietnamese power companies last year on eco-friendly fuel conversion projects.

The tips and predictions for AFL Round 11,"Round 11 of the 2024 AFL season is upon us with some intriguing games ahead over the weekend.

Finals contenders are facing off on each day, with the Dogs facing the Swans, Dockers playing the Pies, Blues meeting the Suns, Cats welcoming the Giants and Dees hoping to end the Saints' season.

On top of that, we'll get all of the excitement of Sir Doug Nicholls Indigenous Round, with Dreamtime at the 'G the showpiece between the Dons and Tigers on Saturday night.

With all of that in mind, see our tips and predictions for Round 11 below.

Thursday night footy is set to return to its brilliant best in Round 11, with both the Western Bulldogs and Sydney Swans in strong form.

John Longmire's Swans are shooting for a 10-1 record, a start to the season not seen for the club since 1936. They've been clinical throughout the 2024 season, with all of their wins coming by 22 points or more in proving potent ahead of the footy.

Ironically, their only loss came to now-17th Richmond. Make sense of that as you will, but Sydney holds no fears having since claimed the scalps of Gold Coast, GWS, Fremantle in Perth and most recently Carlton.

In defeating the Blues, Swan Chad Warner played the second best game seen this year on AFL rating points and proved that if you want to go after one star, another one is going to stand up in spades.

Combatting all of Sydney's weapons is Luke Beveridge's biggest headache on paper, with game-breakers on every line for the Swans.

But in what is a mild free hit for the Dogs after their last two wins, including most recently over the Giants at Engie Stadium, expect Beveridge's men to come out firing on all cylinders.

They've averaged just shy over 100 points over the last three weeks, with key forward Aaron Naughton looking to be in career best form.

Ed Richards has also proven to be dynamite in the midfield, while a Liam Jones-led defence has conceded just 12 total goals in the last fortnight.

Their game is in good order, a leap back into the top eight beckons with a win and the Swans may be sleepy in the week before their bye.

But Sydney's proven to be the most trustworthy team in the competition so far and have no chinks in their armour.

That's the big question ahead of this Friday night clash as the Pies are even more depleted than they have been in recent weeks.

While this side hasn't lost since Round 2, this might just be the breaking point with the likes of Ed Allan and Wil Parker joining similarly inexperienced types Harvey Harrison, Lachie Sullivan and Joe Richards in the side - all players who didn't look close to getting into the team just a month ago.

Luckily for Collingwood, most of these names have performed brilliantly, but it's going to be a tough task against a very fit Fremantle side at home with a star-studded midfield that's been going to work in 2024.

With Collingwood lacking forwards and Fremantle not exactly a high-scoring team, you can expect this one to be somewhat of a slugfest as the Dockers will hope to keep the Pies to under 65 if they're to win.

There's no doubt that they can do that ... unless Nick Daicos gets off the chain as he has done across his last month of absolutely ridiculous football.

If he, Scott Pendlebury and Jack Crisp continue their form on-ball, the Magpies probably extend their undefeated streak to eight games.

If the Dockers get on top on-ball, Collingwood's already depleted forward line might not get the big amount of opportunities that they will need to kick a winning score against this strong defensive outfit.

The tip is with Fremantle, only because of Collingwood's injury crisis ... without that, they look like the best side in the competition currently behind Sydney on form.

North Melbourne were much more competitive in last weekend's loss to Essendon, running them to seven points at the main break.

But they were unable to maintain the rage and were eventually overrun by 40 points - their seventh 40-plus margin of the season.

Alastair Clarkson's Kangaroos have now lost 10 on the trot in 2024 with an average losing margin of 51.4 points.

Port Adelaide came from the clouds to edge Hawthorn in Round 10. The Power came from 41 points down to get up by a point - their equal largest comeback in history.

It was a bittersweet result given they were so poor for three quarters yet managed to snaffle the four points.

Will they have an emphasis on a faster start at Blundstone Arena this Saturday afternoon? You'd imagine Ken Hinkley has been drilling that sort of message home all week.

The Power have won their last four over the Roos by an average margin of 56.7 points, including the last two in Hobart by 70 and 69 points. They've won nine of the last 10 meetings between the two clubs.

There is a little bit of spice in this with No.1 draft pick Jason Horne-Francis playing his 50th AFL game (and 33rd for Port) against his former club the Roos.

On paper, it looks a fairly straightforward match to assess. The Power currently hold fourth spot (pre-round) and should comfortably be accounting for a winless team team on the bottom of the ladder.

The Roos could make life difficult for Port but it should not stop Hinkley's men from picking up their eighth win of 2024.

A lot is quietly riding on this game. Carlton and Gold Coast feel like two teams fighting for the 5-8 range of the ladder come the end of the season and these four points could swing it.

The Suns have been a flaky team so far this season, yet to win an away game. Damien Hardwick has turned them into a serious side on the Gold Coast and they have continued their domination of Darwin, but can they fly to Victoria and beat a wobbly Carlton in front of 45,000 fans?

The Blues will be praying that Jacob Weitering gets through training and plays, while Adam Saad, Jesse Motlop and Lachie Fogarty could also return.

Carlton has struggled to apply forward pressure and move the ball from half back - those three ins address just that.

Under the roof at Marvel, Carlton should have the advantage. Particularly with the Suns coming off successive games in the Darwin heat.

But Damien Hardwick has only lost once to the Blues since 2014, and playing in Victoria will hold no fears for him - even if he's not overly fond of the Docklands.

Of the teams currently sitting comfortably in the top eight, there are no two more desperate for a win than the Cats and Giants.

Both sides enter Round 11 having dropped their last three games, something that seemed unfathomable just a month ago when GWS and Geelong sat undefeated at the top of the table.

The Cats have felt the sting of the league-wide injury plague in recent weeks, with stars like Jeremy Cameron, Patrick Dangerfield and Sam De Koning spending time on the sidelines during their slide.

Yet things have been even worse for the Giants, with their injury list one of the largest in the competition, highlighted by the devastating loss of Josh Kelly for at least another month.

This has GWS' trademark surge game style completely disappear over the last few rounds, averaging a paltry 58 points across their last three games, a far cry from the 90.5 points per game they averaged up until Round 7.

If the Giants arrive at GMHBA Stadium wielding the conservative, possession-based approach they have displayed in their last three losses, they will struggle to break through Geelong's stellar defensive structure.

Apart from the aberration that was last week's display against Gold Coast in Darwin, the Cats have essentially remained the side that started out the season on fire, losing to the Demons and Power in back-to-back weeks by a combined margin of 14 points.

If the Giants can get back to the style that made them one of the most dangerous teams in the competition to start 2024, they can give the Cats a run for their money.

However, if they show up as the team we have seen throughout May, Geelong should be more than capable of getting the job done at the Cattery.

Dreamtime at the 'G feels a little different in 2024, a year on from Damien Hardwick's final game in charge of Richmond.

The Tigers are hurting with a crippling injury list and on the back of a massive 119-point defeat at the hands of Brisbane.

Adem Yze has to deal with 18 unavailable players (as of Wednesday afternoon), but could get a few players back this week, including Liam Baker.

Essendon enters this as unbackable favourites, for the first time we can remember in a Dreamtime game, and rightly so.

They're playing a game of substance under Brad Scott which has them sitting second on the ladder (pre-round) with a 7-1-2 record.

The Bombers are on a three-game winning streak and six game unbeaten run which should at least extend into next week.

Form and personnel-wise, it's impossible to tip against the Dons who have a stranglehold on this game.

Richmond will want to provide a bit more effort and intent than has been shown over the past fortnight, and although the Tigers might be more competitive, it's hard to see them getting too close.

While the Dons haven't really blown teams away this year, they might get that opportunity at the MCG on Saturday night.

But that's not what we've seen from the Lions in 2024, with their form as unpredictable as any.

In saying that, they've begun to build somewhat over the last three weeks, beating Gold Coast and Richmond at home while drawing against Adelaide away.

That kind of form should see them be too strong for the Hawks, but Sam Mitchell's side has also improved over that period, beating the Western Bulldogs and St Kilda before pushing Port Adelaide all the way at the Adelaide Oval.

If they bring that kind of footy to Marvel Stadium on Sunday, they're right in this.

They also beat Brisbane the last two times they've played them in Melbourne, although those games were at the MCG.

Under the roof, Brisbane's record is far better, having won eight of their last nine in Docklands.

They should make it nine out of 10 here if their ball movement gets going given their forward line far outmatches Hawthorn's defence one-on-one.

That's where the game will and should be won.

But... crazier things have happened in games between these sides recently, and it's hard to trust either mob in 2024...

The underfire Saints head to the MCG to face the Dees who have uncharacteristically lost two in a row.

Aside from North Melbourne and West Coast, the Saints head into Round 11 as one of the most out-of-form teams in the competition and that doesn't bode well for them against a Melbourne side that heads to the MCG equal 10th on the ladder.

Melbourne's stranglehold over the Saints in recent times isn't pleasant reading for St Kilda fans with the Demons winning the last four games quite comfortably.

If the Saints are in chance of winning, they must be given the license to take the game on and be willing to kick a score.

The last two games for Ross Lyon's side have seen them kick 55 and 53 points and against a Melbourne defence that is historically stingy, this could be a dark day for Max King and his fellow forwards.

Jake Lever missing does make the task a little bit easier for the Saints but their key forward stocks won't be causing Simon Goodwin and his coaching group much grief ahead of Sunday.

Melbourne's midfield had their colours lowered against West Coast and that is something that isn't said often when you speak about Christian Petracca, Max Gawn, Clayton Oliver and Jack Viney.

Tipping that quartet to dominate on Sunday and make a mess of one of the worst midfield groups in the competition.

A bottom end clash between two teams whose ladder position fails to reflect their ability.

The Crows enter this one in 13th place with just three wins from their 10 games, however, are certainly one of the in-form teams in the competition.

In the last six weeks, Adelaide have won three, drawn one and lost two games by a combined seven points (three points versus Essendon, four points versus Collingwood).

They have shown plenty of fight following their poor start to the season, and if they want any chance at a late September push, home fixtures against bottom four sides are the games that they cannot let slip.

As for the Eagles, this will be a massive test as to where they stand in the competition.

West Coast have successfully turned Optus Stadium into a fortress, winning three of their last four home games including a huge scalping over Melbourne in Round 10.

The issue for Adam Simpson's men lies interstate, losing every away fixture in 2024 by an average of just over 57 points.

The Crows enter this battle without star Izak Rankine (hamstring), who has quickly proven himself as one of the competition's best, while the clash between Jake Soligo and Harley Reid should not be overlooked.

The last of a dying breed of vintage full forwards in Taylor Walker and Jake Waterman will be a fight to watch, both entering the game in good nick, while Waterman may face the highly-touted Irishman Mark Keane in a heavyweight contest.

Both sides are in hot form, but away from home it's hard to side with the Eagles.",sen.com.au,news,SEN 1116,,0.3098039215686275,454143677,1,https://images.ctfassets.net/u8w3l566ay8a/3SzhRSynpP148MDhG7KFff/e9b68d408a2ec7165f6af39c5fa7af2c/10EsRi23DB3569.jpg?w=1200&h=630,

Nvidia shares are hovering close to record highs ahead of its quarterly earnings due late on Wednesday. However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

FIRING UP THE DATA CENTRES

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index has risen over 9%, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7% rise in the main STOXX 600 index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2% versus a 9% rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum, Verbund and renewables supplier EDP, to larger players like RWE, Iberdrola, Enel and Engie.

ADOPTERS VERSUS ENABLERS

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange, information and analytics group RELX and software group Sage as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big U.S. names behind the technology.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft and Alphabet's Google have shot up 33%-41%.

Meanwhile, some European companies have been quietly using AI to develop new products that are already benefiting their customers, said Stotzel.

""This has resulted in the European-listed beneficiaries trading at more attractive valuations,"" he said, listing German software company SAP and Swiss drugmaker Roche among those his team are focused on to play the AI theme.

Miners are another area of investor interest, particularly for copper, which has hit record highs above $11,000 a metric ton this week, spurred largely by a shortage of material for prompt delivery.

Commodity trader Trafigura believes copper demand linked to data centres and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030 and exacerbate supply deficits towards the end of the decade.

""The copper boom is also part of the AI craze,"" Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, said.

VivaTech 2024 in Paris is expected to be a huge success, welcoming more than 150,000 visitors. It is Europe's largest technology and innovation event, attracting CEOs, C-leaders, venture capitalists and startups from around the world. The speaker lineup includes Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX, European Council President), Mark Pritchard (P&G Chief Brand Officer), Yoshua Bengio (Professor at the University of Montreal), Dario Amodei (Antropic CEO), Yann LeCun (Meta Lead AI Scientist), Werner Vogel Dr. Su (Amazon CTO) and others are very luxurious.

There's no doubt that Paris is the perfect place to glimpse the future and discover the latest deep tech, climate technology and mobility innovations. VivaTech presents a unique opportunity to anticipate the profound and fundamental changes that AI and the green market revolution will bring to our economy and society. Whether we like it or not, these are deeply intertwined and will inevitably fundamentally transform societies and economies, becoming invisibly integrated into every action of our daily lives. It will be.

Success with AI requires 1) data, 2) major investments in infrastructure, and 3) cutting-edge algorithms. I don't know if France can really compete with the US or China on 1 and 2, but if we are going to pick the AI battle, we should focus on algorithms and expertise at the intersection of AI and environmental sustainability. is. I strongly believe that with its AI expertise and advances in sustainability, France can play an important role at the intersection of AI and environmental issues. Here's why:

French AI research is admired among AI leaders at global French companies. In recent years, many global companies have opened AI and R&D centers in France. Some companies, like Ekimetrics, are well-positioned at the intersection of AI and environmental issues. Mistral AI was recently listed by Forrester as one of the leading AI foundation models for languages. Investment in AI training is accelerating. President Macron yesterday announced an additional 400 million yen for AI training, with the aim of having 100,000 AI experts by 2030. Awareness of climate and sustainability issues is higher than in many countries. Initiatives like Climate Fresk help raise public awareness of climate change. Decarbonization of electricity is progressing in France. This is due to the importance of nuclear power in the energy mix. The AI experts we spoke to said they don't know how energy-intensive AI will become. Few countries can achieve AI. Because without significant investment in nuclear technology, AI cannot function in the long term. A global energy, power and environmental services company is headquartered in France. Examples include EDF, Engie, Legrand, Rexel, Saur, Schneider Electric, Sonepar, Suez, Veolia, and Vinci. The startup ecosystem is full of innovative green technology companies. This is highlighted by the new French Tech Next40/120 released today.

French new technology Next40/120

The French government today announced the 2024 edition of the French Tech Next40/120, an index based on startups' ability to generate revenue (currently at least 40 million) and raise capital.

Some facts about French Tech Next40/120:

Funding innovation is important, but it is not a panacea.

There is still too much hype and fascination with unicorns. And technological innovation alone is not enough to live within the boundaries of nine planets. Low-tech solutions and frugal innovation, regulation and new business models, evolving consumer behavior, and changing executive mindsets are even more important. However, don't ignore the fact that green technology can also help.

Enables energy and utility companies to confidently embrace modern data and analytics capabilities

Denodo, a leader in data management, announced that the company is expanding its efforts to provide energy and utility companies with the necessary data management capabilities to gain advanced capabilities and meet new renewable energy requirements, all while remaining in compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory demands.

Facing numerous challenges, including generating, managing, and consuming new, decarbonized and increasingly digitized sources of energy; maintaining resilience and sustainability in a time of change; developing new technologies such as virtual power plants (VPPs) based on intelligent operations; all while managing a rising number of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability initiatives; energy and utility companies need to be able to manage data so that it helps to overcome these challenges, rather than adding to them.

The Denodo Platform facilitates this by providing real-time access to data across myriad distributed energy resources, while enabling the establishment of a unified semantic layer over all data sources, to deliver data when it is needed, in the language required by each data consumer. This provides energy and utility companies with the foundation to overcome myriad known and unknown challenges. The Denodo Platform enables such capabilities as continuous monitoring and control, and makes it possible for VPP operators to make fast, informed decisions in response to changes in energy demand, pricing, and environmental conditions. By enabling such capabilities, the Denodo Platform provides energy and utility companies with a reliable foundation for innovation.

Denodo has a strong heritage in providing impactful data management solutions to energy and utility companies, such as VTTI, a Netherlands-based energy storage and developer of critical energy infrastructure; BHP, a global resources company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia; Engie Mexico, an energy company that is committed to bringing energy to the people of Mexico; and Suez, a French multinational corporation with operations in water, electricity, natural gas supply, and waste management.

Hans Geurts, chief information officer for VTTI, says, ""As a rapidly growing organization in an uncertain geopolitical environment, laying a strong data foundation was critical for us to become data-driven. The Denodo Platform has helped us in simplifying and standardizing our data infrastructure, while boosting our business resilience."" The Denodo Platform acts as VTTI's single source of truth for enterprise resource planning (ERP) data. The company leverages it to synthesize, combine, and analyze operational insights to improve ways of working and address inefficiencies in the operational micro-steps at the company's terminals. It also helps VTTI to visualize and understand product trade flows through the terminals and various modes of transport, helping VTTI's commercial teams to better serve customers.

Joshua Fletcher, superintendent HSE, Reporting at BHP, made similar statements about the effect that the Denodo Platform had on the company's business. ""The Denodo Platform helps us to reduce the overall size of the data sets that need to be moved over the network. It helped us to create a logical data fabric that makes our data assets reusable and can be consumed by users spread across the globe.""

Luis Guadarrama, senior manager, Data Analytics and Innovation at Engie Mexico, says, ""The Denodo Platform delivers data quickly and easily, which helps us to deliver value to the business and democratize data access.

However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index has risen over 9%, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7% rise in the main STOXX 600 index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2% versus a 9% rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum, Verbund and renewables supplier EDP, to larger players like RWE, Iberdrola, Enel and Engie.

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange, information and analytics group RELX and software group Sage as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big U.S. names behind the technology.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft and Alphabet's Google have shot up 33%-41%.

Meanwhile, some European companies have been quietly using AI to develop new products that are already benefiting their customers, said Stotzel.

""This has resulted in the European-listed beneficiaries trading at more attractive valuations,"" he said, listing German software company SAP and Swiss drugmaker Roche among those his team are focused on to play the AI theme.

Miners are another area of investor interest, particularly for copper, which has hit record highs above $11,000 a metric ton this week, spurred largely by a shortage of material for prompt delivery.

Commodity trader Trafigura believes copper demand linked to data centres and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030 and exacerbate supply deficits towards the end of the decade.

""The copper boom is also part of the AI craze,"" Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, said.

Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence helped drive a rally across equity markets in 2023, propelling Nvidia and Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML into the spotlight.

Nvidia shares are hovering close to record highs ahead of its quarterly earnings due late on Wednesday. However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

FIRING UP THE DATA CENTRES

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index has risen over 9%, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7% rise in the main STOXX 600 index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2% versus a 9% rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum, Verbund and renewables supplier EDP, to larger players like RWE, Iberdrola, Enel and Engie.

ADOPTERS VERSUS ENABLERS

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange, information and analytics group RELX and software group Sage as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big U.S. names behind the technology.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft and Alphabet's Google have shot up 33%-41%.

LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - European stock pickers are turning to more established sectors like utilities, professional data providers and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of the AI boom, a year after AI chipmaker Nvidia's emergence as a driving force.

Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence helped drive a rally across equity markets in 2023, propelling Nvidia and Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML into the spotlight.

Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence helped drive a rally across equity markets in 2023, propelling Nvidia and Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML into the spotlight.

Nvidia shares are hovering close to record highs ahead of its quarterly earnings due late on Wednesday. However, some of the sheen has rubbed off Europe's AI-linked megacaps, prompting investors to seek out cheaper alternatives.

Stock pickers are now looking at companies and sectors that are likely to be long-term AI beneficiaries.

""The first phase of AI was obviously chipmakers like Nvidia. Then you've already seen the second wave move to the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centres,"" said Bernie Ahkong, CIO Global Multi-Strategy Alpha at UBS O'Connor.

""And now we're just starting to get the third phase into utility/power firms in the past several weeks.""

FIRING UP THE DATA CENTRES

Data centres, which are essential to the rise of generative AI, need huge amounts of energy and this is expected to surge as demand for the centres accelerates.

The International Energy Agency estimates total power consumption from data centres will top 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2026 - roughly what Japan consumes now - from 460 TWh in 2022.

""One of the most interesting ways within Europe to play AI on a multi-year basis actually is via some of these utilities companies,"" UBS O'Connor's Ahkong said.

Demand for data centre space in Europe is also set to outstrip delivery of new stock for the third straight year and AI demand will exacerbate the issue, said Kevin Restivo, who heads European data centre research at real estate services provider CBRE.

In the last five weeks, the utilities index has risen over 9 per cent, driven largely by expectations for interest rate cuts, versus a 4.7 per cent rise in the main STOXX 600 index. But they are still lagging the rest of the market year-to-date, up just 0.2 per cent versus a 9 per cent rise in the benchmark index.

Bank of America said in a recent note European utilities bosses are talking about AI, but upside potential from data centres is ""anecdotal at best"".

Even so, the bank says plenty of companies could benefit from a boom in AI-linked power demand, from Fortum, Verbund and renewables supplier EDP, to larger players like RWE, Iberdrola, Enel and Engie.

ADOPTERS VERSUS ENABLERS

A year ago, investors had been jittery around the disruptive potential of AI for anything from IT services to media, education and consulting.

""How I look at AI in the UK, the US has the enablers, we've got the adopters,"" Trevor Green, head of UK equities for Aviva Investors, said.

""When investors will get particularly interested is when we can actually quantify this in revenue potential. The providers are rightly still being a bit evasive on this as we are at such an early stage of adoption,"" he said.

He highlighted the London Stock Exchange, information and analytics group RELX and software group Sage as examples of companies that have been working on AI for years.

""Now we are properly starting to see revenue-generating opportunities from it,"" he said.

Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust, says a lot of the AI hype has been around the big U.S. names behind the technology.

In the past year, shares in the likes of OpenAI backer Microsoft and Alphabet's Google have shot up 33 per cent-41 per cent.

Meanwhile, some European companies have been quietly using AI to develop new products that are already benefiting their customers, said Stotzel.

""This has resulted in the European-listed beneficiaries trading at more attractive valuations,"" he said, listing German software company SAP and Swiss drugmaker Roche among those his team are focused on to play the AI theme.

Miners are another area of investor interest, particularly for copper, which has hit record highs above $11,000 a metric ton this week, spurred largely by a shortage of material for prompt delivery.

The first batch of nature strategies which have been reviewed and accepted into Business for Nature's 'It's Now for Nature' campaign has been published today to mark the International Day for Biological Diversity.

According to an update from the coalition of more than 90 firms seeking to support the development of a nature-positive economy by 2030, British pharmaceutical company GSK and French Luxury goods group Kering were among the first companies whose plans have rubber stamped. Anne Veck Limited, ENGIE, and Taiwan Cement Corporation also had their strategies approved.

Developed by the Business for Nature coalition and its partners, 'It's Now for Nature' encourages firms and financial institutions to develop and publish nature strategies in order to reduce negative impacts, boost business resilience, develop new commercial opportunities, create long-term value, and strengthen climate and sustainability goals.

Each approved strategy should include an assessment to identify material nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, introduce nature targets, set out plans to both avoid and reduce negative impacts on nature, and secure C-suite or board approval for the strategy and responsibility for its delivery.

Submissions are reviewed against minimum criteria to ensure they contain these key elements before they are listed on the It's Now for Nature website.

""Nature is vital for human health and the development, manufacture and supply of medicines and vaccines,"" said Claire Lund, vice president for sustainability at GSK. ""Taking action to protect and restore nature is business critical, and the development and review of our nature strategy, as part of the 'It's Now for Nature' campaign, is an important milestone in our journey to contribute to a nature positive world.""

Corporate efforts to protect and enhance nature are accelerating through global initiatives such as the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), while governments are also advancing nature protection policies following the adoption of the Global Biodiversity Framework.

But Business for Nature warned progress needed to accelerate further if corporates and governments were to deliver on their commitment to reverse nature loss by 2030 and honour long term climate goals.

With the UN's COP16 Biodiversity Summit taking place in Colombia later this year, the group said the first 'It's Now for Nature' strategies should send a strong signal to policymakers that there is business support for the development of nature-positive economies.

""At Kering, we are proud that our nature strategy is among the first featured as part of It's Now for Nature, and we hope this will contribute to the growing momentum of corporate nature action encouraging more companies to develop and publish an ambitious strategy for a nature-positive future,"" said Géraldine Vallejo, sustainability programme director at Kering.

This investment was made alongside Engie New Ventures, Engie's investment fund for innovative start-ups which help accelerate the energy transition. The new investors join the founder and historic shareholders of CryoCollect.

Since its creation in 2017, CryoCollect has specialized in the design and engineering of gas treatment, liquefaction and separation technologies for gases such as bio-methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. CryoCollect has built a multidisciplinary team of engineers and researchers, combining high-level scientific expertise with robust industrial know-how.

The company has especially pioneered the capture, purification and liquefaction of carbon dioxide contained in exhaust gases from anaerobic digestion (biogas), enabling the production of liquid biogenic CO2. Such biogenic CO2, which is part of the natural short carbon cycle, can replace fossil CO2 in industrial processes which require CO2 as a feedstock, such as the food & beverage industry or the production of synthetic fuels. With more than a dozen references already marketed, CryoCollect's CO2 capture technology for biogas is, by far, the technology with the largest number of actual deployments.

CryoCollect applies its know-how in gas processing and liquefaction in other areas to accelerate the energy transition, notably industrial and CO2 capture on-board vessels, re-liquefaction of CH4 boil-off, BioLNG liquefaction to transport bio-methane, as well as its' use as a sustainable fuel.

Market Overview:

LNG bunkering involves the transfer of liquefied natural gas to ships for the purpose of ship fuel. LNG as a marine fuel is used to power ship engines and generators.

It helps reduce emissions and provides cost benefits compared to conventional marine fuels.

Market Dynamics:

Stringent environmental norms for reducing sulphur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions from ships are expected to drive the demand for LNG as a marine fuel. The International Maritime Organization has implemented regulations to limit sulphur content in marine fuels which has led ship owners and operators to adopt LNG as an alternative fuel.

Additionally, growing LNG trade and increased adoption of dual-fuel engines compatible with LNG bunkering are also fueling the market growth during the forecast period.

LNG Bunkering Market Drivers: Environmental Regulations Are Pushing for Cleaner Marine Fuels

Stringent environmental regulations by International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from ships is a key driver boosting adoption of LNG as a marine fuel. The IMO has set a reduction target of 40% in carbon dioxide emissions from ships by 2030 and aims to reduce total annual GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008.

With sulfur emission regulations also getting stricter each year, ship owners are compelled to switch to cleaner burning fuels like LNG from conventional fuels. The 2020 global sulfur cap of 0.50% introduced by IMO has accelerated this transition.

Using LNG helps meet both the emission regulations as it emits almost no sulfur and significantly lower emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxides and particulate matter compared to conventional fuels.

Growingscale of LNG powered new vessel builds and conversions

The number of LNG-powered vessels on order or in operation has increased rapidly over past few years driven by the viability of LNG as a marine fuel. Major shipowners and operators are ordering new LNG fueled container vessels, car carriers, bulkers and cruise ships indicating confidence in LNG as a transition fuel.

Ship owners are also carrying out conversions of some of their existing vessels to run on LNG to replace aging vessels and comply with emission norms. This growing scale of new LNG fueled vessels and conversions is driving higher demand for LNG as a bunker fuel.

The lack of sufficient LNG bunkering infrastructure globally, especially in key ports and trade routes, acts as a major barrier in widespread adoption of LNG as a marine fuel. Very few ports worldwide currently have facilities to supply LNG as bunker fuel.

Developing infrastructure for LNG bunkering is a complex and capital intensive process requiring investments in storage, pipelines and bunker vessels. This deters ship owners and ports from fully committing to LNG unless the necessary bunkering network is developed.

The timing and scale of investments required to develop infrastructure also makes it difficult to match demand growth. Until more bunkering terminals and supply sources are established across major shipping lanes, the supply chain constraints will continue to challenge the LNG bunkering market potential.

LNG Bunkering Market Opportunity: Tax breaks and incentives for using cleaner fuels

Many countries and regional bodies are providing tax breaks, subsidies and other financial incentives to encourage broader uptake of LNG as a marine fuel to reduce emissions from shipping sector. For example, European Union provides aid to promote LNG bunkering infrastructure development through Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) fund.

U.S. offers tax credits for use of LNG as a transportation fuel. South Korea offers load factor discounts on LNG bunker price.

Such initiatives make the economics of adopting LNG more attractive compared to conventional marine fuels for ship owners. As environmental regulations tighten, more countries and ports are expected to introduce favorable tax policies and financials supports to accelerate shift towards cleaner marine fuels and provide opportunities for future growth of LNG bunkering market.

LNG Bunkering Market Trends: Increasing focus on small scale bunkering solutions

One of the emerging trends in LNG bunkering market is the shift towards developing small scale, flexible solutions for supplying LNG to vessels. This is mainly because developing large scale infrastructure is difficult given current supply and demand.

Companies are focusing on innovations like portable bunkering stations, bunker barges, and decentralized micro/mini-LNG terminals which require less capital than conventional terminals and cater to niche trade routes or ports that cannot justify big capital investments yet. Other innovative concepts gaining traction include LNG river-sea vessels, LNG fueled tug boats and self-sustained floating bunkering terminals.

Such small scale, scalable and modular solutions aim to overcome infrastructure constraints and facilitate supply where demand is nascent. This shift to flexible bunkering models is expected to accelerate commercialization of LNG as a marine fuel over the coming years.

In the third week of May, prices in most major European electricity markets registered an upward trend between Tuesday, May 14, and Friday, May 17, reaching the highest daily price of the week on that day. However, this peak was lower than the previous week's peak. Despite the aforementioned upward trend, weekly prices fell compared to the previous week. The exceptions were the N2EX market of the United Kingdom and the IPEX market of Italy, with increases of 0.2% and 5.8%, respectively. The Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries reached the largest percentage price decline, 67%. In contrast, the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium registered the smallest percentage decline, 6.9%. In the other markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices fell between 11% in the EPEX SPOT market of the Netherlands and the MIBEL market of Spain and 27% in the EPEX SPOT market of Germany.

In the third week of May, weekly averages were below €50/MWh in most analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the Dutch, British and Italian markets, with averages of €55.80/MWh, €81.80/MWh and €96.12/MWh, respectively. In contrast, the Nordic market registered the lowest weekly average, €13.18/MWh. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €23.68/MWh in the French market to €49.13/MWh in the German market.

Regarding hourly prices, most analyzed European markets registered negative prices on May 14 and 19. The exceptions were the British and Italian markets, which had no negative prices in the third week of May. On the other hand, the German, Belgian, French, Dutch and Nordic markets also had negative prices on May 18 and the first four markets on this list, on May 13. In addition, the Dutch market registered negative prices on May 15, while the German and Nordic markets had negative prices on May 15 and 16. In the third week of May, the Dutch market registered the lowest hourly price again, ?€80.00/MWh, on Sunday, May 19, from 13:00 to 14:00.

During the week of May 13, the fall in the average price of gas and CO emission allowances and the increase in wind energy production in most analyzed markets had a downward influence on European electricity market prices. However, in the Italian market, wind and solar energy production fell, contributing to the price increase in this market.

AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's price forecasts indicate that prices in some European electricity markets, such as Germany, Spain, the Netherlands or Portugal, might increase in the fourth week of May, influenced by the decrease in wind energy production. In the rest of the markets, prices will be slightly lower than the previous week.

Hans Royal, senior director of renewable energy and carbon advisory for Schneider Electric's sustainability services, told ESG Dive the transferability mechanism is a ""revolutionary development"" for the energy industry.

Schneider Electric said Crux played a ""significant role in facilitating and streamlining"" the transaction and credited the sustainable finance company for first connecting the energy management company with Silfab.

Schneider Electric's president of North America Operations Aamir Paul said in the release that the company is looking to leverage the IRA's transferability provisions to ""foster the development of renewable energy infrastructure and contribute to a more sustainable planet.""

The IRA's tax credit transferability ""significantly enhances Schneider Electric's ability to support the clean economy, reinforcing our leadership in the energy transition,"" Royal said in an emailed statement to ESG Dive. ""We are excited to announce multiple successful tax credit transferability transactions, showcasing the feasibility and benefits of these innovative deals.""

CEO and co-founder of Crux, Alfred Johnson, called Silfab a leader in the ""booming"" sector of domestic energy component manufacturing. Johnson said this represents Silfab's first sale of 45X tax credits, which provide tax breaks for eligible products made in the U.S., such as solar modules, cells, wafers and polysilicon.

Oil futures trade lower early Tuesday as traders worry over the outlook for crude demand as the Federal Reserve maintains higher interest rates.

Oil futures climbed Friday, contributing to gains for the week and prompting U.S. benchmark prices to settle above $80 a barrel for the first time this month, as some economic data from the U.S. and China raised hopes for stronger crude demand.

Residents were told they should stay home Friday if they are nonessential workers, and local schools were closed until Monday.

Private-equity firms are beginning to tap a nascent market for clean-energy tax credits, betting on a boost to returns from helping project developers get better terms for the tradable credits.

The law now offers a particularly sweet deal: a combination of subsidies that can cover or even exceed a project's costs.

Engie reaffirmed expectations for the year after core earnings fell slightly in the first quarter, driven by declines from its networks and global energy management and sales businesses.

Electric vehicle, wind turbine and solar panel manufacturers face a shortfall in critical metals and minerals unless more investment is made in projects such as new mines and recycling, according to a report from the International Energy Agency.

The State Government-owned generator being built in Whyalla must connect to the grid as soon as possible to counterbalance the impacts of early closures of privately operated gas-fired generators and fresh cross-border delays to the interconnector being built between SA and NSW.

Without the Hydrogen Jobs Plan generator, the state would be at risk of failing to meet national reliability standards, according to the report published by AEMO.

The heightened risk highlights the recklessness of the former Marshall Liberal government, which sold off operation of two gas-fired generators which had been purchased by the state to ensure South Australia had a buffer of power kept in reserve for emergency use to avoid blackouts.

It also highlights the complacency of the Marshall administration banking on the Project EnergyConnect transmission line connecting to power supply in NSW.

When that connector was proposed in 2016, a target build date was set at 2021 with costs estimated at $500 million to $1.5 billion.

Costs and schedule grew in stages until the project was approved by the Australian Energy Regulator in May 2021 at a cost of $2.3 billion and a completion date of June 2023.

The South Australian part of the connector from Robertstown to the border was finished late last year but the NSW side has faced ongoing delays, with the latest announced in April.

In today's report, AEMO now expects the full 800-megawatt capacity to only be available by July 2027 because of the NSW delays.

Since AEMO published its annual reliability report - the 2023 Electricity Statement of Opportunities - last August, early closures of privately owned generators have been flagged.

AGL now says one of the four 200MW units at its Torrens Island Power Station will not return to service. The remaining three units are due to close in mid-2026.

Meanwhile in February, ENGIE announced it would mothball its 75MW plant in Port Lincoln and its 63MW Snuggery plant in the South-East from July this year. Full closure of both plants has been brought forward to 2028 instead of 2030.

These changes, and other developments interstate, have led AEMO to publish today's update to its 2023 report.

The update forecasts that in 2026-27, South Australia will be at risk of being 35MW short of the reliability standard which requires at least 99.998 per cent of forecast customer demand to be met.

Under the tighter interim reliability standard - of 99.9994 per cent to meet a one-in-ten-year hot summer - SA would be at risk of being 305MW short.

SA demand usually gets to about 1500MW a day but exceeds 3000MW during summer heatwaves.

AEMO's most pressing concerns are in NSW and Victoria, where shortfalls against the interim reliability standard are expected from this coming summer onwards as coal-fired power stations exit the system. The report states NSW is at risk of being more than 1000MW short as soon as 2025-26.

In SA, however, AEMO has factored the Malinauskas Government's Hydrogen Jobs Plan 200MW generator into its central scenario to be built in 2025-26 and fully commissioned by 2026-27.

The new Hydrogen Jobs Plan turbine will greatly reduce risk, putting SA into safe territory to meet the tight interim reliability standard and keep the lights on once it is fired up.

As put by Tom Koutsantonis

In the privatised electricity market, operators have flirted with the edge of reliability to minimise their capital investment in new generation and maximise their profits.

When Labor was last in Government, we fixed the problem by buying back-up generators - but the Marshall Liberal government sold them off.

Now, new risks have emerged which show that the State Government's investment in the Hydrogen Jobs Plan is absolutely essential.

This is an independent assessment that proves the Hydrogen Jobs Plan is good for jobs, good for the environment and good for all households in this state.

Doosan Enerbility said Tuesday that it will supply and install burners and auxiliary equipment for one of the Mejillones power station's units in Antofagasta, northern Chile, that has a generation capacity of 375 megawatts. The new equipment will allow the steam plant's boiler to burn natural gas instead of coal.

The switch will produce the same amount of electricity, but is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by around 40 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by 70 percent.

The plant will run on coal until 2025, but is required to either retire or convert to other fuels due to Chile's environmental regulations and the French energy company Engie's neutral carbon policy, according to Doosan. Construction for the upgrade will start in the same year and take around six months.

""The conversion minimizes the shutdown period of the power plant compared to retiring the plant and constructing a new one; it is an economic low-carbon solution that also cuts down on costs as it uses the most of the existing facilities,"" Sohn Seung-woo, head of Doosan Enerbility's power service, said.

Natural gases are considered a ""bridge fuel"" in the transition to renewable energy. The decision to repurpose plants to use natural gas instead of coal is typically driven by stricter emissions standards and lower natural gas prices.

Power purchase agreement is also called as ""Green Power Purchase Agreements"" (Green PPAs). The power purchase agreements operate over the medium or long term (5 to 20 years). In the agreement, the developer sells the power generated to the host customer at a fixed rate which is typically lower than the local utility's retail rate. Several benefits are associated with PPA such as a fixed long-term rate and guarantees of origin of renewable assets. All regions are engaged in the development of the power sabing solutions which can help to lower the global footprints and cost saving on power consumptions. The adoption of green energy is increasing in Asia, and Australia which is creating power purchase agreement market opportunity.

Lower power prices encourage customers to sign PPAs and make fewer purchases of electricity from utilities which is boosting the power purchase agreement market share in the energy industry. PPA ensure developer to receives the income from the sales of electricity as well as any tax credits and other incentives generated from the system which is uplifting the power purchase agreement market size in forecasted period. At the end of the PPA contract term, a customer may be able to extend the PPA or choose to buy the solar energy system from the developer.

Large corporates are entering into PPA to buy electricity from renewable energy projects located near to their premises (on-site projects) and sometime remote from their location (off-site). As per power purchase agreement market forecast, corporates are entering to PPA to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency which help the business to complete the sustainability policies. In all regions, the consumption of green energy is increasing on high rate which foster the power purchase agreement market growth. With implementation of the proposed programs to build a energy efficient corporate building will help to boost the power purchase agreement market trend in near future.

Expectations that the stimulus measures announced by China last week will help revive the property sector in the world's second largest economy, and optimism about interest rate cuts in the coming months helped underpin sentiment in European markets.

European sovereign bond yields edged up after ECB Governing Council member Martins Kazaks indicated in a Bloomberg Adria interview that June seems the right moment to start lowering borrowing costs, but future moves will be largely determined by incoming data.

Kazaks emphasized that any reduction in rates should be ""cautious"" and ""gradual,"" and that the process should not be rushed.

Separately, ECB executive board member Isabel Schnabel also warned against back-to-back interest-rate cuts in June and July.

""Based on current data, a rate cut in July does not seem warranted as there is a risk of easing prematurely,"" she told the Nikkei newspaper.

Bank of England's Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said the interest rate could be cut some time over the summer.

The outgoing deputy governor said if things continue to evolve as expected, then the policy will have to become less restrictive at some time.

Elsewhere, U.S. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Friday that she has seen no progress in inflation this year and remains willing to hike rates should progress stall or reverse.

The pan European Stoxx 600 ended higher by 0.8%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 edged up 0.05%, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both ended up by 0.35%, while Switzerland's SMI climbed 0.76%, extending gains to a third straight session.

Among other markets in Europe, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkiye closed higher, while Russie ended weak.

In the UK market, Rolls-Royce Holdings rallied nearly 4.5%. Fresnillo, Weir Group, Entain and Airtel Africa gained 2.4 to 4%.

Ashtead Group, JD Sports Fashion, Melrose Industries, RightMove, ICG, Kingfisher, IMI, Lloyds Banking Group, Antofagasta, Centrica, Smiths Group, Admiral Group and IHG ended higher by 1 to 2%.

Shares of Keywords Studios soared about 61% after the company said that it is in talks with European private equity company EQT Group over a possible cash offer worth 2,550 pence a share.

EasyJet, Burberry Group, Ocado Group, Sage Group, Prudential, Beazley, BT Group, Frasers Group, Imperial Brands, Natwest Group and Reckitt Benckiser lost 1 to 3.2%.

In the German market, Covestro gained more than 2%. MTU Aero Engines, SAP, Infineon, Deutsche Telekom, Commerzbank, BASF and Henkel also posted notable gains.

Siemens Energy drifted down more than 2.5%. Porsche, Puma, Mercdes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen lost 1 to 2%.

In the French market, Teleperformance climbed about 3%. Societe Generale, Safran, Airbus Group, Schneider Electric, Thales and Kering gained 1 to 2.3%.

Carrefour, STMicroElectronics, Engie, Renault and Pernod Ricard closed weak.

Energy Storage May Be the Solution.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Is one of the fastest-growing elements of the clean energy revolution in danger?

In a new report published this year, The Conference Board investigated this question, taking an in-depth look at the solar energy industry and the problems posed by growing overreliance on solar technology in the United States and beyond.

Given the relatively low cost of solar energy, it makes sense that both individual households and entire companies would be drawn to it as a power source. The combination of solar's cost effectiveness and the mounting threat of climate change has led to an economy in which solar technology seems to offer the best of both worlds. This should be good for the planet and for investors in clean energy stocks, right?

Well, as The Conference Board warns, this growing emphasis on the clean low-cost energy source could create significant volatility across energy markets, leading to ""a continued reliance on nonrenewables.""

That is because solar companies currently face a unique challenge: Power grids aren't in alignment with current use and demand. Too much energy produced leads to wasted resources while too little can mean blackouts. This system can put both solar producers and consumers at risk. In the worst-case scenario, it could mean severe consequences that span beyond the U.S.

The World Bank notes that historically, when energy prices have surged to dangerously high levels, it has made food and other essential goods unaffordable. This is due to rising transportation costs and factory outages. Other consequences include a lack of electricity, stopping children from studying and business from being conducted.

According to experts, though, there are ways to help this problem. Conference Board Senior Economist Alex Heil, author of the report, told InvestorPlace that there are two key things that will address supply-demand imbalances with solar power. First, U.S. energy grids need diversification. Second, the U.S. needs more adequate energy storage solutions.

This means that, for investors, there's ample opportunity not just in solar stocks but in their energy storage peers. Heil told InvestorPlace:

""Solar is going to need other technologies that work with it [...] I think there's going to be a lot of research, development [and] implementation of storage in particular. That might be storage on a distributed grid basis, as well as on a more utility level. And I think that we're just in the early stages of seeing storage being discussed as the necessary investment that it's going to be.""

It has become increasingly clear that power grids must be handled carefully by policymakers who seek to increase the nation's reliance on renewable energy sources. A 2024 academic study argues that the 2021 Texas power grid failure -- which led to over 200 deaths across the state -- highlighted the need for rebalancing. This suggests that if the state had prioritized rebalancing its grid prior to the meltdown, the crisis could have potentially been avoided, or at least made less severe.

Like many economic matters, grid rebalancing centers around supply and demand. In this case, the objective is to consistently balance the energy supply generated by clean sources such as solar with demand from consumers.

One of the primary challenges in grid balancing is the ability to store the excess energy. AZO Cleantech defines grid balancing as being ""the task utility companies have of supplying the correct amount of electricity to the grid.""

Keeping the generation and consumption of renewable energy sources perfectly balanced is difficult and, sometimes, simply not feasible. In these instances, storing excess energy is critical to prevent blackouts and for keeping grids operational. Energy storage refers to the process of accumulating energy in a specific system of equipment with the purpose of deploying it at a later time when it is needed.

For solar, the technology helps keep energy flowing in times of darkness and helps make the flow of energy to the grid consistent. Recent reports show that this is true on both the consumer side -- referred to as ""behind the meter"" (BTM) -- and the utility side, or ""in front of the meter."" For businesses that depend on solar energy, this means less reliance on the power grid as well as on fossil fuels. Deloitte noted in a 2023 report:

""Technological breakthroughs and evolving market dynamics have triggered a remarkable surge in energy storage deployment across the electric grid in front of and behind-the-meter (BTM) [...] Battery-based energy storage capacity installations soared more than 1200% between 2018 and 1H2023, reflecting its rapid ascent as a game changer for the electric power sector.""

If the current clean energy transition is to continue, solar energy will continue to be at the forefront. But scaling solar energy's growth cannot happen unless the energy storage industry keeps pace with solar firms, allowing energy producers to store the clean energy and thus help rebalance power grids at a crucial time.

Patrick Knight, National Vice President for Solar and ESS strategy at Rexel USA, told InvestorPlace:

""The addition of battery storage in both the commercial and utility space will allow solar power to exist as a net positive for longer hours, help reduce excess demand on the grid, and allow businesses to take control of their energy costs [...] Ultimately, the advancement of battery storage technology allows the solar market to vastly increase its viability.""

This means savvy investors may want to consider leading energy storage providers like Fluence Energy (NASDAQ:FLNC) and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). These companies will likely benefit from a surge in demand as the need for energy storage solutions intensifies. As evidence of this, French utility giant Engie (OTCMKTS:ENGIY) selected Fluence as its partner on a large-scale energy storage project at a power generation plant in the Netherlands.

If the energy storage industry can continue to grow and innovate, it can significantly benefit not just solar energy stocks but the entire clean energy sector.

The potential for energy storage developments is why experts remain bullish on solar stocks.

After 20 years of investing in solar energy, Esplanade Capital President and Chief Investment Officer Shawn Kravetz sees the industry as being in an interesting and overall promising situation, even with the problems it faces regarding overreliance and grid disruptions.

At the time of our conversation, Esplanade held positions in several solar stocks, including names like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and Sunnova (NYSE:NOVA), which have both actually outperformed the S&P 500 in the past month. It makes sense that investment firms would be bullish on these stocks. Both companies maintain consensus strong buy ratings from Wall Street. Fellow solar energy stocks NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) also hold consensus buy ratings.

Wall Street's interest in solar energy investing makes sense. Early in 2024, a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed that solar and wind technology would likely lead the growth of power generation in the U.S. for the coming two years. Specifically, the report forecast that ""U.S. solar power generation will grow 75% from 163 billion kilowatthours (kWh) in 2023 to 286 billion kWh in 2025.""

If that is true, those invested in solar energy now will be in an excellent position.

The upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election will likely generate some uncertainty for solar stocks. That's because former President Donald Trump is significantly more likely to prioritize policies that favor the fossil fuel industry, home to many of his campaign donors. Recently, the former president promised fossil fuel executives that he will roll back President Joe Biden's environmental policies in exchange for $1 billion in campaign contributions. As The New York Times reports, this would likely mean the elimination of solar and wind power tax credits. Trump's plan would also likely include major changes to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has various clean energy incentives for Americans.

This could certainly give some investors pause regarding solar energy stocks. However, the stock market's current performance suggests that victory will be likely for incumbent Biden, especially as the U.S. economy continues to grow. Biden has made it clear that he believes in prioritizing clean energy development, including solar. In this vein, the White House recently announced plans to raise import tariffs on solar panels, which will likely provide a boost for domestic solar manufacturers.

As long as the White House remains under Democrat leadership, solar energy stocks are likely to benefit. And energy storage companies will have plentiful opportunities to grow as the U.S. keeps transitioning toward a solar-powered future.",markets.businessinsider.com,news,Markets Insider,,0.1450980392156862,453917232,1,,

8137051402,eng,False,2024-05-20,15:36:14,2024-05-20T15:36:14Z,2024-05-20T15:34:20Z,news,0.0,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4694534-engie-solid-progress-in-renewable-capacity-addition,Engie: Solid Progress In Renewable Capacity Addition (OTCMKTS:ENGIY),"Following our Enel Q1 Beats And Raises update, today we are back to comment on Engie (OTCPK:ENGIY). For our new readers, Engie is a French-based integrated utility company that supplies gas and electricity. On a divisional level, around 15% of the company's EBIT comes from renewables, thermal, and nuclear, with an additional 25% from networks. On a geographical basis, the EU is the largest contributor to earnings, followed by the LATAM region.

Here at the Lab, we see similarities with Enel equity story. Both companies trade below their peers, and we support their renewable energy development. On a standalone basis, our Engie buy rating was backed by:

Before looking at our supportive buy rating, we provided the latest results about Engie Q1 (Fig 1). The CEO commented that the company ""has made an excellent start to 2024 with EBIT excluding nuclear."" He also explained that ""this robust performance reflects, once again, the strength of our integrated model as well as our capacity to adapt to a rapidly moving market environment."" Engie's turnover was expected to slow down and reach €22 billion. This negative performance was attributed to factors such as lower energy and gas prices. As a reminder, the EU gas prices have tumbled about 40% yearly due to the spikes after Russia invaded Ukraine. Going down to the P&L analysis, we report the following:

Currently, Engie has confirmed its renewable energy pace growth with 7 GW of capacity under construction. In Q1, the company added 0.7 GW of renewable output, bringing Engie's total installed capacity to 42.1 GW (Fig 2). Q1 capacity addition means that the group is on track to add, on average, 4 GW of renewable capacity until 2025. Still related to the energy transition, the company has completed further steps to add EU biomethane production incrementally. This was performed via bolt-on M&A. Indeed, Engie acquired Rainbarrow Farm in the United Kingdom and two other biogas site acquisitions in the Netherlands. Consequently, the company reached a 1 TWh threshold of annual biomethane output.

Going to the nuclear exit, on 18/04/2024, the Belgian government voted a law for a ten-year extension of two reactors (Tihange 3 and Doel 4), with no liabilities regarding nuclear waste. This is a decisive step toward Engie's nuclear closing, and we miss only the EU approval (Fig 3).

Following the Q1 results, here at the Lab, we project an unchanged turnover estimate of €83.2 billion with a 2024 EBITDA of €14.54 billion. Considering an aggressive step-up in growth CAPEX due to the ongoing renewable energy project development and €100 million higher net financial cost, we slightly lowered our core operating profit from €9.07 to €8.97 billion. With no change in technical guidance (corporate tax), we lower our EPS from €1.81 to €1.79. These earnings changes are aligned with Engie's 2024 outlook. In detail, the company confirmed its 2024 guidance, excluding nuclear, expecting a 2024 core operating profit between €7.5 and €8.5 billion. Going down to the P&L estimates, Engie confirmed a 2024 net income between €4.2 and €4.8 billion, despite a slight rise in net financial cost.

Regarding the company's valuation, we recently valued Enel. Looking at the EU-integrated companies' sector, players trade with a normalized P/E above 15x with an EV/EBITDA of 10x on average (Fig 4). Even considering an aggressive CAPEX and looking at the EV/EBIT, Engie seems undervalued. In our 2024 numbers, considering a lower EPS, Engie trades at a P/E of 8.8x with an EV/EBITDA of approximately 5.6x. Currently, our team sees limited value in Engie's earnings growth prospects. Moreover, as already reported, the Engie network segment will likely allow the French player to lower energy prices more gracefully. The overhang on nuclear liabilities has been removed and we now expect a positive confirmation from the EU.

Engie is committed to a ""strong investment grade"" credit rating, investing for growth and remunerating its shareholder basis. With a confirmed 65% to 75% payout ratio, we believe that the company will likely pay a DPS above €1 per share in the next three years visible period. This means a dividend yield of at least 6.5%. For this reason, our team sees no reason why Engie should trade at a discount. Confirming our 10x P/E target with an EV/EBITDA of 6.5x (aligned with the company's five-year historical average - Fig 5), we value Engie with a target price of €17.9 per share. This means an overweight valuation.

The company is an integrated utility, thus exposed to various risks typical of the utility sector. This includes commercial and operating risks, which may be challenging for outside observers to assess. Downside risks also include lower energy prices and CAPEX delays, given the additional capacity target set by the company. In addition, renewable energy players are exposed to weather conditions such as no wind or solar. Engie is also exposed to movements in often volatile energy markets. Higher interest rates negatively impact the company's bottom line.

Following our positive view of Enel, we believe Engie will be the next. Multiple pieces of evidence support our view, such as an attractive valuation, a remuneration story, a growth story on renewable energy higher capacity development, and an economic moat on Engie's network division. Engie is a solid buy at this price.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Mare Evidence Lab,0.2313725490196079,453915374,100,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/2125784047/image_2125784047.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

The wind park, located in Romania's southeastern commune of Chirnogeni, Constanta county, is expected to generate around 180 GWh of electricity per year, which is enough to power about 90,000 households, Engie said in a press release.

The transaction, whose value was not disclosed, almost doubled Engie Romania's wind energy generation capacity and brought its total installed capacity of wind and solar energy production to 202 MW.

""This strategic investment represents another important step towards achieving the objectives of reaching an installed capacity of 1,000 MW of renewable energy by 2030"", said Cristian Buzan, deputy general manager of Engie Romania.

Engie announced in January that it had signed an agreement to acquire the Chirnogeni wind farm.

In 2023, Engie announced it would build greenfield solar power plants in the Prahova and Braila counties, with installed capacities of 37.2 MWp and 9.3 MWp, respectively.

The Engie Group employs over 100,000 people globally and is present in Romania in natural gas, electricity and energy services sectors. Engie Romania currently operates two wind farms in the Braila and Galati counties, with a total installed capacity of 98 MW, as well as four solar parks in the Arad, Buzau, Harghita, and Teleorman counties, with a cumulated installed capacity of 24 MW.",seenews.com,news,See News,,0.3647058823529412,453900542,39,https://cdn.aiidatapro.net/media/c9/7f/dd/t780x490/c97fdd533896d6314b3ddb775b323532.jpg,eng-9579357

Oil prices wavered Monday after Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash Sunday, according to state-run Press TV.

Oil futures climbed Friday, contributing to gains for the week and prompting U.S. benchmark prices to settle above $80 a barrel for the first time this month, as some economic data from the U.S. and China raised hopes for stronger crude demand.

Stephen Wynne-Jones looks forward to The Consumer Goods Forum Global Summit. This article first appeared in ESM's May/June 2024 edition.

In 1964, Frank Sinatra recorded one of his best-loved hits, an ode to Chicago entitled My Kind of Town, with lyrics that celebrate city landmarks such as the Wrigley building and the now-closed Union Stockyards - as well as its ""razzmatazz ... and all that jazz.""

Some 60 years on, this summer, Chicago will play host to The Consumer Goods Forum Global Summit - the annual meeting of minds for retail and consumer goods leaders - which will seek to set out a road map for the sector in terms of collaboration, resilience, and driving positive change. No better location, therefore - after all, as Ol' Blue Eyes put it, Chicago is a city that ""won't let you down"".

Under the theme 'Empowering Businesses to Deliver a Better Tomorrow', the summit will feature industry leaders from some of the world's biggest retail and CPG firms - including Coca-Cola, Ahold Delhaize, Mondelēz International, Walmart International, AS Watson, Unilever, L'Oréal, Loblaw, Danone, PepsiCo, Bel Group, Wegmans, Haleon, Instacart, Aldi and Kraft Heinz, to name but a few - and will take place from 11 to 14 June at the Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk.

This year's summit will also feature an appearance from Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of the United States, who will take part in a moderated Q&A session on 12 June, sharing her wisdom and leadership on how to ignite positive change. ESM will be reporting live from the summit - keep an eye on the ESM website (www.esmmagazine.com) and our social media channels for updates.

Building on the momentum of the 2023 summit in Kyoto, Japan, this year's event will continue efforts to 'accelerate the pace of change' for both The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) and its members, as underpinned by the collective efforts and commitment of the CGF's Coalitions of Action.

As of the end of last year, there are now nine Coalitions of Action: the Forest Positive Coalition, the Plastic Waste Coalition, the Food Waste Coalition, the Human Rights Coalition, the Collaboration for Healthier Lives Coalition, the Global Food Safety Initiative, the Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative, and the Product Data Coalition, as well as the new Net Zero Coalition, which will seek to consolidate diverse decarbonisation initiatives within the sector and foster increased collaboration among CGF members and the broader Race to Zero network.

The event will also act as an opportunity to take stock of the progress being made around the Acceleration Areas announced by CGF co-chairs Frans Muller, president and chief executive of Ahold Delhaize, and Dirk Van de Put, chairman and chief executive of Mondelēz International.

The Acceleration Areas were introduced to recalibrate focus, scale up existing coalition actions, and bring more industry players into the fold, focusing on such areas as employee health and well-being, ensuring human rights in supply chains, advancing packaging circularity, promoting deforestation-free supply chains, and moving forward on decarbonisation.

Commenting on the Acceleration Areas in the CGF's annual report earlier this year, managing director Wai-Chan Chan noted, 'To the wider industry, we invite you to join us in tackling global challenges and championing progressive change in an exceptional setting, where you gain insights and best practices from peers who are committed to propelling our industry forward. [...] Together, we all play a pivotal part in reshaping the future of the consumer goods sector.'

Following an all-day store tour programme on 11 June, taking in some of the city's most innovative retailers, the summit kicks off on Wednesday 12 June with an invitation-only CEO Breakfast series (with Tesco CEO Ken Murphy, Unilever CEO Hein Schumacher and DFI Retail Group's Scott Price) holding concurrent events), before the opening address from co-chairs Muller and Van de Put, alongside CGF managing director Chan and plenary moderator Isabelle Kumar.

The 2024 edition of the summit takes place just months from the midpoint of the decade - a milestone that is likely to be met with increased effort by those striving to achieve a 2030 agenda, and a joy or a disappointment for companies that have achieved or fallen short of their 2025 aspirations, respectively.

Either way, the summit should act as a springboard for decisive, collaborative action for the remainder of the decade.

Statkraft, Europe's largest renewable energy producer, said this month that it was reviewing its annual targets for new renewables capacity, while Portuguese energy company EDP is cutting back its plans, citing high interest rates and lower power prices.

At the same time, Denmark's Ørsted -- the world's largest offshore wind developer -- has slashed its renewable targets for 2030 by more than 10GW, enough to supply potentially millions of homes, after it was forced to abandon two large projects in the US because of rising costs.

""We are seeing continued growth [of renewables], but at a slower pace,"" Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal, chief executive of Statkraft, which is owned by the Norwegian state, told the Financial Times.

Spanish energy giant Iberdrola said in April it would adopt a more ""selective"" approach to renewables and increase its focus on electricity grids. It no longer has an 80GW renewables target for 2030, but highlights its pipeline of 100GW.

Italian utility Enel announced in November that it would cut its investment in renewables, from €17bn between 2023 and 2025 to €12.1bn between 2024 and 2026. However, the company said it planned to continue increasing renewables capacity with partners to reach its target of 73GW by 2026.

""There has been a big reality check around renewables growth,"" said Norman Valentine, head of renewables research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. ""There's been a huge change in the cost environment.""

The picture is not universal: Germany's RWE significantly increased its renewables target in November last year, from 50GW by 2030 to 65GW.

There is a growing political focus on the need to develop renewables, with countries agreeing at the COP28 climate summit in November to work towards tripling capacity to 11,000GW by 2030.

However, rising interest rates over the past few years have pushed up the costs of financing new projects, creating difficulties for some developers. Raw material costs have also risen, while in some markets, electricity prices have fallen. The often slow process of regulatory approval also creates challenges.

Some companies, including Enel, have said they want to invest more in upgrading electricity networks, which will be vital in the transition from fossil fuel to clean electric power. Iberdrola is planning to spend about 60 per cent of a planned €41bn of investment in the electricity grid.

Ralph Ibendhal, head of Emea energy transition at RBC Capital Markets, noted that high interest rates meant renewables developers had to compete harder for investors.

""A 7-9 per cent return at project level looks less attractive when base rates are 5 per cent,"" he said. ""Many utilities also have opportunities to invest in other areas of their business (such as regulated networks) instead.""

Deepa Venkateswaran, head of utilities at Bernstein, said that companies were investing more in networks in the expectation of improved returns given their importance to the energy transition.

Iberdrola and French utility Engie have also recently cut or delayed targets for producing ""green"" hydrogen -- a potential replacement for fossil fuels in several industries that is heavily dependent on subsidies. Iberdrola said it was ""still waiting for funds to come through"" for projects.

Despite the current challenges, Vartdal at Statkraft said she was confident the economics of projects would improve. Ibendhal, at RBC, agreed.

Despite leading at quarter time, Adam Kingsley's Giants could only muster three more goals in slippery conditions at Engie Stadium. A disastrously inaccurate Bulldogs performance kept GWS in the game longer than the home side should have been, with Luke Beveridge's men booting a staggering 8.22 (70) to 6.7 (43) in the wind.

It's the Dogs' second consecutive win, just the second time in 2024 they've managed such a feat, and leaves them knocking on the door of the top eight ahead of games against difficult opponents in Sydney and Collingwood in the coming fortnight.

Meanwhile, after heading into the Sydney derby as premiership favourites earlier this month, the men in orange have fallen off a cliff and recorded losses to the tune of 29, 20 and now 27 points in the past three rounds.

Adam Treloar and Ed Richards were among the best Bulldogs on the field, racking up 35 and 27 possessions respectively, while former Demon James Harmes broke the game up in the second half with two goals and an equal game-high nine score involvements.

Taylor Duryea picked up 12 possessions and six intercepts in his 200th game.

On the flip side, Tom Green was the only Giants midfielder to win more than five clearances while having 22+ disposals.

It doesn't get any easier for Kingsley and his men in the coming months, with games against Geelong, Sydney and Port Adelaide ahead in the next four rounds.

Ten years ago, our group founded ENGIE New Ventures. How did it all start?

The idea at the time was to bring a wave of innovation to ENGIE by collaborating with startups. We had his three goals: decarbonise, decentralize and digitize our activities (the three Ds). Over the past 10 years, he has invested in over 50 startup companies as a minority shareholder in the company. Our current goal is to leverage external innovation to drive the energy transition and improve the Group's operational performance.

This enables ENGIE to identify and understand emerging technologies and gives us privileged access to incorporate these innovations into our activities.

Can you give an example of a startup in which you have invested? Our portfolio currently includes 25 startups in which we do not have a controlling interest. For example, consider Raptor Maps. The Boston-based company has developed a lifecycle management platform for solar power sites. The company's innovative technology automatically analyzes drone imagery to detect non-compliance issues. Raptor Maps has established promising collaborations with renewable energy GBUs to enhance productivity gains. This framework agreement would not have been possible without the close relationships facilitated by our investments.

Another stumble for offshore wind in New York has highlighted shifting sentiment in the offshore wind turbine market.

Last month, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) chose not to sign offtake agreements with three planned offshore wind projects after designated turbine supplier GE Vernova decided to switch to a smaller turbine.

The 1.4 GW Attentive Energy One (TotalEnergies and Corio Generation), 1.3 GW Community Offshore Wind (RWE and National Grid) and 1.3 GW Excelsior Wind (Vineyard Offshore) projects were all awarded provisional contracts in a competitive auction in October 2023.

GE Vernova decided to switch from its latest 18 MW turbines to a 15.5/16.5 MW platform and this caused ""technical and commercial complexities"" which meant the project could not proceed under the awarded contract terms, a NYSERDA spokesperson said. Most U.S. offshore wind projects set to be built over the next few years plan to install turbines in the 11 to 15 MW range.

The developers declined to comment on their plans for the projects but they have indicated their continued interest in the New York market, NYSERDA said. Last month, New York announced plans for two more offshore wind solicitations this summer and in 2025.

After years of rapid increases in turbine capacities, GE Vernova's decision reflects a trend by western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of introducing fewer new turbines and focusing on existing models for longer.

GE Vernova did not give a reason for its turbine switch, but it follows a difficult few years in which volatile costs and delivery challenges have delayed projects and severely dented the revenues of turbine suppliers.

The hunger for larger turbines led to some developers bidding projects based on turbines in early development stages, which can lead to offtake awards that are at higher risk of abandonment by awardees, a spokesperson for Danish turbine supplier Vestas told Reuters Events.

Vestas plans to focus on its 15 MW offshore wind turbine. This size is ""best positioned to enable greater certainty of on-time, successful project delivery,"" the spokesperson said.

Standardisation

Over the past decade, offshore wind developers in Europe and U.S. sought larger turbines to lower the cost of energy per kilowatt hour and win state-backed power contracts in competitive auctions.

The maximum size of new offshore wind turbines has risen from around 8 MW to around 15 MW amid an ""arms race"" among leading OEMs, said Signe Sorensen, Senior Research Analyst for the Americas at Aegir Insights.

CHART: Global average offshore wind turbine capacities

Intense competition squeezed the margins of turbine suppliers, while volatile global costs and logistics issues since the coronavirus pandemic have prompted offshore wind investors, developers and suppliers to reassess project risks.

On the U.S. East Coast, soaring costs and high interest rates prompted multiple cancellation of offshore wind contracts, delaying projects and curbing progress in building out new supply chain facilities.

Under financial pressure, western wind turbine suppliers are producing less turbine variants than Chinese rivals.

Since 2020, western suppliers have announced 29 new variants of onshore and offshore wind turbines, compared with over 426 from China, according to Endri Lico, principal analyst for Global Wind Technology and Supply Chain at Wood Mackenzie.

""The main reason is due to OEMs profitability pressure and their need to simplify their product portfolio,"" Lico told Reuters Events.

Focusing on one model size could lead to reduced manufacturing costs thanks to standardization and industrialization, hence providing western OEMs and their component suppliers with the ""clearest path to return to profitability,"" Lico said.

A focus on more mature existing technology would enable the supply chain to ""reap the quality and cost benefit of consistent volume and an industrialized wind turbine technology over many years,"" the Vestas spokesperson said.

""Designing technology with the current supply chain in mind will result in cost predictability, shorter execution times, and industry scalability,"" the spokesperson said.

Timing risk

Developers look to optimise power generation and in some cases smaller turbines can be more cost-competitive because they can produce more power at slower wind speeds, feature more mature technology, or are more readily available.

Developer Ocean Winds, a 50/50 joint venture owned by EDP Renewables and ENGIE, selects the best turbine size for a given project while also ""considering time to market,"" a company spokesperson said.

The pioneering 800 MW Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts (Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid) is currently installing an earlier turbine model by GE Vernova designed to operate at 14.7 MW. Meanwhile, the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will install 14.7 MW Siemens Gamesa turbines (SGRE) in the next few years while Orsted has chosen the 11 MW Siemens Gamesa models for the 924 MW Sunrise Wind project in New York.

Vestas has received firm orders for 15 MW turbines from projects in Poland, Germany and the Netherlands and has signed conditional agreements to supply the turbine to Equinor's Empire 1 and 2 projects in New York, the company said. Empire Wind 1 is slated to start producing power in 2026 but Empire Wind 2 has yet to secure an offtake agreement.

The standardisation of turbines at existing capacities would reduce the need for new larger vessels or significant upgrades to existing vessels.

A lack of U.S. wind turbine installation vessels remains a significant risk for project developers, exposing companies to global vessel supply markets and workarounds using barges to transport into and out of East Coast ports.

""The cost savings from the larger turbines are partially lost to increased vessel costs,"" Sorensen noted.

Bidding year

A raft of U.S. offshore wind auctions this year will indicate whether developers will be happy to focus on 15 MW turbines in their mid-term growth plans.

Developers including Orsted, Avangrid, Vineyard Offshore, EDP and Engie bid to secure up to 6 GW of new offshore wind capacity in the latest power auctions by three New England states. Together, the East Coast states of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maryland plan to tender for around 16 GW of offshore wind power in 2024.

Lico expects GE Vernova, Vestas and Siemens Gamesa to focus on the 14 to 15 MW range until 2029-2030, when they could start launching bigger models.

""They will continue to co-exist with the next-generation turbine for some years (beginning of '30s) until we fully transition to 20 MW [plus],"" he said.

Developers will continue to be tempted by larger turbines and lower costs, and ongoing innovations by Chinese suppliers could spur western suppliers to refocus towards larger units.

Indeed, Siemens Gamesa has announced plans to develop ""the world's largest offshore turbine generator"" and has received funding from the European Union for a prototype model.

But the 34-year-old appeared to suffer a brain explosion as those two sides faced off at a soggy ENGIE Stadium in Sydney on Saturday night.

Doggies fans were gutted when the then-hugely talented youngster Ward opted to join the expansion Giants ahead of their debut season, following 60 games over four years at the Kennel.

He gave them a small gift back on Saturday, however, before the Dogs went on to secure the upset win, 8.22 (70) to 6.7 (43).

With just over 13 minutes remaining in the first half of a dour affair, a Finn Callaghan hand pass found Ward, who was matched up with Bulldogs superstar Marcus Bontempelli.

The former GWS skipper quickly rushed the ball onto his left boot and looked up to see if anyone was on the end of it as it soared inside 50m.

Someone was, Bulldog Rhylee West, who led opponent Harry Himmelberg out of the goalsquare and took a perfect chest mark in a play that would make a forwards coach proud.

Not Giants coach Adam Kingsley, however, who was seen muttering under his breath as West went back and kicked the gift goal.

Himmelberg was completely bemused, while Ward -- who chalked up his 300th AFL game against the Bombers last week -- looked for the nearest hole he could dive into.

""That went the wrong way from Callan Ward,"" Jonathan Brown said in commentary. ""Did he forget which way he was going?""

""He's kicked it the way of his old team,"" Anthony Hudson added. ""Confusion reigns.

""After 300 games he's forgotten which way he's kicked it and as a coach, you can't really account for that.""

""He thought he had the old jumper on,"" Brown chipped in.

""As Rhylee West is lining up, Callan Ward is just shaking his head,"" Hudson continued.

""Sometimes you just can't believe your good luck and it's a Doggy roar.""

Jordan Lewis then called a replay of the incident.

""Handball back and (Ward) just turns around and kicks it in the wrong direction,"" he said.

""Well he did get concussed in the 2016 preliminary final against the Dogs,"" he said, before catching himself. ""It's no laughing matter concussion, I know, but oh boy.""

It wasn't the only brain explosion on the night for the Giants.

Early in the first quarter, Callaghan entered the centre circle for a ball up as the two ruckmen were engaged, with the umpires paying the very rare free kick.

""Everyone that's ever played football knows that's a free kick,"" Lewis stated.

But Ward's moment was the focus of many, including the Giants' social media account, renowned as probably the best in the business among AFL clubs.

Their admin couldn't resist a couple of digs at their former club champion and current games record-holder.

""Callan Ward still thinks he's playing for the Bulldogs,"" was their first post on X.

They then followed up with a better line.

""We will be kicking to the right of your screen in the third quarter,"" they wrote.

""Callan Ward has been informed.""

Fans took delight in the rare error from a champion of the game.

""You can take the boy out of the West but you can't take the West out of the boy,"" was one comment on X.

""Does the goal assist count on his stat sheet?"" another asked.

""Not good, tell him he is wearing orange,"" suggested a third.

The company, which makes most of its income from producing, transporting and selling gas and electricity, said earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), excluding nuclear, totalled 3.7 billion euros ($4.02 billion), versus 3.8 billion euros in the same period of 2023.

Engie said it was still targeting annual net recurring income on a group share basis of 4.2-4.8 billion euros.

Its shares were down 1.7% at 0844 GMT.

Despite the ""strong"" results, income was buoyed by several one-offs that made it difficult to gauge underlying performance, said JP Morgan analysts in a note.

They added a negative one-off in early 2023 had also made the year-to-year comparison more favourable for the company.

Profits at oil and gas firms are still retreating from 2022 records, when natural gas prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Spot gas prices in Europe have tumbled about 40% in the last year, hit by mild winter weather and easing supply worries.

Revenues for the quarter fell 24.6% to 22 billion euros.

Overall, the company said it made 136 million euros less across distribution networks and sales because winter temperatures in France were higher than normal.

Much of the decline in earnings from gas sales was offset by Engie's smaller but growing renewables business, with more rain in Portugal and France boosting output of clean electricity from hydropower.

Its flexible generation unit, comprising gas plants, pumped hydropower and batteries, also helped, it said.

Engie added 0.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in the first quarter, with an additional 7 GW under construction from 68 projects. It also signed 300 megawatts of renewable power purchase agreements.

However, the company said it has been unable to find a buyer for its loss-making subsidiary EV Box, which makes electric vehicle charging stations and software, and now hopes to sell off individual sites.

""It's an activity that has suffered in recent years ... with the Ukraine crisis and soaring energy prices, plus national governments revising their subsidy schemes leading to a massive slowdown in installations,"" finance chief Pierre-Francois Riolacci told journalists.

""We've done all we could to set the company right, but in the end it's not our main business,"" he said, adding, however, that it was premature to discuss closures or layoffs for some 700 workers mostly in the Netherlands.

Traders may be reluctant to make significant moves as they digest recent strength in the markets, which saw the major averages reached new record intraday highs.

The Dow climbed above 40,000 for the first time ever on Thursday before giving back ground and ending the day slightly lower.

While recent economic data has generated optimism about an interest rate cut in the coming months, comments from Federal Reserve officials have put a damper on some of the cheer.

Following the slew of U.S. data released over the past two days, the economic calendar is relatively quiet today, although the Conference Board's report on leading economic indicators in April may still attract some attention.

The Conference Board's leading economic index is expected to dip by 0.3 percent in April, matching the decrease seen in March.

Stocks moved to the upside early in the session on Thursday but fluctuated over the course of the trading day before eventually closing modestly lower. The major averages partly offset the strong upward move seen over the two previous sessions.

While the Dow climbed above 40,000 for the first time in morning trading, the blue chip index ended the day down 38.62 points or 0.1 percent to 39,869.38. The S&P 500 dipped 11.05 points or 0.2 percent to 5,297.10 and the Nasdaq fell 44.07 points or 0.3 percent to 16,698.32.

The early strength on Wall Street reflected an extension of the rally seen during Wednesday's session, which came amid optimism about the outlook for interest rates following tamer-than-expected consumer price inflation data.

A closely watched Labor Department showed consumer prices rose by less than expected in April, reinforcing expectations the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in the coming months.

According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, the chances rates will be a quarter point lower by September have reached 85.5 percent.

Buying interest waned over the course of the session, however, with traders seemingly pausing to assess the near-term outlook for the markets after the major averages reached new record highs.

On the U.S. economic, the Labor Department released a report this morning showing a pullback by initial jobless claims in the week ended May 11th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims slid to 222,000, a decrease of 10,000 from the previous week's revised level of 232,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to fall to 220,000 from the 231,000 originally reported for the previous week.

The pullback came after jobless claims rose to their highest level since the week ended August 26, 2023 in the previous week.

Meanwhile, traders largely shrugged off a separate Labor Department report showing U.S. import prices jumped by much more than expected in April.

The report said import prices shot up by 0.9 percent in April after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.6 percent in March.

Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.3 percent compared to the 0.4 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

The annual rate of growth by import prices also accelerated to 1.1 percent in April from 0.4 percent in March, reflecting the largest over-the-year increase since December 2022.

""The surge in April import prices won't instill the Fed with greater confidence inflation is decelerating, but officials will assuredly put much more stock in yesterday's CPI report which was a small step in the right direction and keeps a rate cut in September, our baseline forecast, firmly on the table,"" said Matthew Martin, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

A separate report released by the Fed showed U.S. industrial production came in flat in the month of April, with a surge in utilities output offset by decreases in mining and manufacturing output.

The Fed said industrial production came in unchanged in April after inching up by a downwardly revised 0.1 percent in March.

Economists had expected industrial production to edge up by 0.1 percent compared to the 0.4 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

While most of the major sectors showed only modest moves on the day, housing stocks moved sharply lower, dragging the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index down by 2.8 percent.

The index pulled back off its best closing level in well over a month after a Commerce Department report showed a rebound by housing starts in April but a continued slump by building permits.

Airline stocks also showed a significant move to the downside, with the NYSE Arca Airline Index falling by 1.4 percent.

Computer hardware stocks also gave back ground after surging during Wednesday's session, while tobacco stocks moved notably higher, driving the NYSE Arca Tobacco Index up by 1.3 percent.

Commodity, Currency Markets

Crude oil futures are rising $0.22 to $79.45 a barrel after climbing $0.60 to $79.23 a barrel on Thursday. Meanwhile, after falling $9.40 to $2,385.50 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are inching up $7.20 to $2,393.70 an ounce.

On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 155.80 yen versus the 155.39 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0840 compared to yesterday's $1.0867.

Asia

Asian stocks ended mixed on Friday as Chinese stimulus hopes offset interest rate worries and mixed data from China.

Gold and oil clung to modest gains in Asian trading as the war in Gaza dragged on and the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of a bill aimed at forcing President Joe Biden to resume arms deliveries to Israel.

Chinese markets rallied as authorities announced fresh measures to revive the struggling property market.

Shares in China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted developer with borrowings of more than $300 billion, soared almost 18 percent and peer China Vanke jumped 10 percent, after China's central bank cut the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers and suggested the government could buy up commercial real estate in a bid to boost the ailing housing market.

China's Shanghai Composite Index surged 1.0 percent to 3,154.03, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.9 percent to 19,553.61.

Investors shrugged off mixed economic data released earlier in the day. Chinese industrial growth accelerated in April, while growth in April retail sales and fixed asset investment during the January-April period softened unexpectedly, official data revealed.

Japanese markets finished lower after a survey showed that majority of Japanese firms are worried about a weak yen hurting profits.

Interest-rate worries were back in focus after three Federal Reserve officials said the U.S. central bank should keep borrowing costs high for longer.

China reported mixed economic data, but the country's central bank moved again to help the struggling property sector, helping ease concerns around economic recovery.

Closer to home, Eurozone CPI was finalized at 2.4 percent year-on-year in April, unchanged from March's reading.

Earlier today, ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos said that inflation in the Eurozone will move near its target of 2 percent in 2025.

Engie reported on Friday lower group pre-tax earnings for the first quarter, due to a decline in natural gas prices and consumption. Excluding nuclear, Engie's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) fell by 3.7% in the first quarter compared to the same period of 2023. Q1 2024 was warmer than Q1 2023 and significantly warmer than average, the company said. Compared to last year, this resulted in lower volumes for French gas distribution activities and for French supply activities, Engie noted.

EV Box booked a loss of $24 million (22 million euros) for Q1, following a loss of $152 million (140 million euros) for 2023, Engie's chief financial officer Pierre-Francois Riolacci said, as carried by Reuters.

Next year, EV Box is also expected to post a loss, the executive said.

Engie has struggled to find a buyer for the loss-making EV charging business, which it acquired in 2017.

""Due to losses at EV Box, as well as the lack of success thus far from our measures to identify a potential buyer for this company, the Group is actively examining all options that could lead to disengage, in accordance with local regulations,"" Engie said in its Q1 earnings release today.

The EV markets in developed economies have struggled in recent months, amid slower-than-expected uptake of electric vehicles.

While the International Energy Agency (IEA) continues to hold a very bullish view on the global EV market, the auto industry is concerned about slowing EV sales with the phase-out of subsidies in key markets and consumers who are not yet convinced about affordability and range.

U.S. sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) fell in the first quarter, losing market share, while Europe's new car sales fell in March for the first time this year, dragged down by a decline in EV registrations and the timing of the Easter holidays.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453647272,29,https://d1o9e4un86hhpc.cloudfront.net/images/facebook-share-logo.png,eng-9579357

Traders may be reluctant to make significant moves as they digest recent strength in the markets, which saw the major averages reached new record intraday highs.

The Dow climbed above 40,000 for the first time ever on Thursday before giving back ground and ending the day slightly lower.

While recent economic data has generated optimism about an interest rate cut in the coming months, comments from Federal Reserve officials have put a damper on some of the cheer.

Following the slew of U.S. data released over the past two days, the economic calendar is relatively quiet today, although the Conference Board's report on leading economic indicators in April may still attract some attention.

The Conference Board's leading economic index is expected to dip by 0.3 percent in April, matching the decrease seen in March.

Stocks moved to the upside early in the session on Thursday but fluctuated over the course of the trading day before eventually closing modestly lower. The major averages partly offset the strong upward move seen over the two previous sessions.

While the Dow climbed above 40,000 for the first time in morning trading, the blue chip index ended the day down 38.62 points or 0.1 percent to 39,869.38. The S&P 500 dipped 11.05 points or 0.2 percent to 5,297.10 and the Nasdaq fell 44.07 points or 0.3 percent to 16,698.32.

The early strength on Wall Street reflected an extension of the rally seen during Wednesday's session, which came amid optimism about the outlook for interest rates following tamer-than-expected consumer price inflation data.

A closely watched Labor Department showed consumer prices rose by less than expected in April, reinforcing expectations the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in the coming months.

According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, the chances rates will be a quarter point lower by September have reached 85.5 percent.

Buying interest waned over the course of the session, however, with traders seemingly pausing to assess the near-term outlook for the markets after the major averages reached new record highs.

On the U.S. economic, the Labor Department released a report this morning showing a pullback by initial jobless claims in the week ended May 11th.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims slid to 222,000, a decrease of 10,000 from the previous week's revised level of 232,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to fall to 220,000 from the 231,000 originally reported for the previous week.

The pullback came after jobless claims rose to their highest level since the week ended August 26, 2023 in the previous week.

Meanwhile, traders largely shrugged off a separate Labor Department report showing U.S. import prices jumped by much more than expected in April.

The report said import prices shot up by 0.9 percent in April after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.6 percent in March.

Economists had expected import prices to rise by 0.3 percent compared to the 0.4 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

The annual rate of growth by import prices also accelerated to 1.1 percent in April from 0.4 percent in March, reflecting the largest over-the-year increase since December 2022.

""The surge in April import prices won't instill the Fed with greater confidence inflation is decelerating, but officials will assuredly put much more stock in yesterday's CPI report which was a small step in the right direction and keeps a rate cut in September, our baseline forecast, firmly on the table,"" said Matthew Martin, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.

A separate report released by the Fed showed U.S. industrial production came in flat in the month of April, with a surge in utilities output offset by decreases in mining and manufacturing output.

The Fed said industrial production came in unchanged in April after inching up by a downwardly revised 0.1 percent in March.

Economists had expected industrial production to edge up by 0.1 percent compared to the 0.4 percent increase originally reported for the previous month.

While most of the major sectors showed only modest moves on the day, housing stocks moved sharply lower, dragging the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index down by 2.8 percent.

The index pulled back off its best closing level in well over a month after a Commerce Department report showed a rebound by housing starts in April but a continued slump by building permits.

Airline stocks also showed a significant move to the downside, with the NYSE Arca Airline Index falling by 1.4 percent.

Computer hardware stocks also gave back ground after surging during Wednesday's session, while tobacco stocks moved notably higher, driving the NYSE Arca Tobacco Index up by 1.3 percent.

Commodity, Currency Markets

Crude oil futures are rising $0.22 to $79.45 a barrel after climbing $0.60 to $79.23 a barrel on Thursday. Meanwhile, after falling $9.40 to $2,385.50 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are inching up $7.20 to $2,393.70 an ounce.

On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 155.80 yen versus the 155.39 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0840 compared to yesterday's $1.0867.

Asia

Asian stocks ended mixed on Friday as Chinese stimulus hopes offset interest rate worries and mixed data from China.

The U.S. dollar's recent downward trend paused after three top Federal Reserve officials urged patience on rate cuts until it's clear inflation is moderating back to the 2 percent target.

Gold and oil clung to modest gains in Asian trading as the war in Gaza dragged on and the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of a bill aimed at forcing President Joe Biden to resume arms deliveries to Israel.

Chinese markets rallied as authorities announced fresh measures to revive the struggling property market.

Shares in China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted developer with borrowings of more than $300 billion, soared almost 18 percent and peer China Vanke jumped 10 percent, after China's central bank cut the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers and suggested the government could buy up commercial real estate in a bid to boost the ailing housing market.

China's Shanghai Composite Index surged 1.0 percent to 3,154.03, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.9 percent to 19,553.61.

Investors shrugged off mixed economic data released earlier in the day. Chinese industrial growth accelerated in April, while growth in April retail sales and fixed asset investment during the January-April period softened unexpectedly, official data revealed.

Japanese markets finished lower after a survey showed that majority of Japanese firms are worried about a weak yen hurting profits.

The Nikkei 225 Index dipped 0.3 percent to 38,787.38, while the broader Topix Index closed 0.3 percent higher at 2,745.62.

Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand's S&P/NZX 50 Index dipped 0.2 percent to 11,699.79 ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's monetary policy decision due next week.

Europe

European stocks have extended declines on Friday after having snapped a nine-day winning streak the previous day.

Interest-rate worries were back in focus after three Federal Reserve officials said the U.S. central bank should keep borrowing costs high for longer.

China reported mixed economic data, but the country's central bank moved again to help the struggling property sector, helping ease concerns around economic recovery.

Closer to home, Eurozone CPI was finalized at 2.4 percent year-on-year in April, unchanged from March's reading.

Green Transition Set to Face Critical Minerals Shortfall, IEA Says

Electric vehicle, wind turbine and solar panel manufacturers face a shortfall in critical metals and minerals unless more investment is made in projects such as new mines and recycling, according to a report from the International Energy Agency.

While market pressures eased in 2023-leading to a slump in prices for metals including copper, lithium, cobalt and nickel-long-term investment is vital to avoid projected demand outpacing supply, according to the analysis from the IEA. The minerals are used in a number of technologies essential to the green transition.

""Secure and sustainable access to critical minerals is essential for smooth and affordable clean energy transitions,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. ""The world's appetite for technologies such as solar panels, electric cars and batteries is growing fast-but we cannot satisfy it without reliable and expanding supplies of critical minerals.""

Engie backed its guidance after its renewables and flexible generation segments helped buoy first-quarter earnings.

The French multinational power utility on Friday posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 5.4 billion euro ($5.87 billion) in the first three months of the year, 0.7% lower on an organic basis than in the same period last year.

Investors are striking gold in most every market.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 40000 mark for the first time Thursday amid an almost picture-perfect investing environment featuring resilient corporate profits, low unemployment and easing inflation.

Risk-averse investors have a bounty of options, too, including certificates of deposit offering yields of about 5% and rising junk bonds and other fixed-income investments, adding to the glow.

Palm Oil Ends Higher, Tracking Soybean Oil's Strength -- Market Talk

1017 GMT - Palm oil prices ended higher, tracking soybean oil's overnight gains. Despite the rise this session, palm oil has been volatile this week after stockpiles surged in April, analysts say. Meanwhile, production for May 1-15 surged 56.35% on month, according to data from the Malaysian Southern Peninsular Palm Oil Millers Association. TA Securities analyst Angeline Chin says the movement of palm oil prices in 2Q will be influenced by both palm oil production in key producing countries and weather patterns in the primary soybean-growing regions of Brazil and Argentina.

Oil Prices Set to End Week Higher, Snapping Brent's Losing Streak -- Market Talk

1002 GMT - Oil prices are broadly flat, but look set to end the week with small gains, the first for Brent in three weeks. Brent crude and WTI are both broadly flat on $83.30 a barrel and $79.21 a barrel, respectively. This week's gains have been driven by a softening in the dollar, but potentially the main price driver in the medium term rests on demand forecasts, says Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades. U.S. oil inventories came up lower than predicted, raising hopes of greater crude demand, but the upside was capped by Chinese economic uncertainty, Evangelista says in a note. ""Against this background, the price of Brent looks set to remain firmly supported above the $80 per barrel level and face resistance at $84,"" Evangelista says. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

Gold Futures Rise as Markets Digest U.S. Economic Data -- Market Talk

0822 GMT - Gold futures rise 0.1% to $2,387.8 a troy ounce, holding ground after U.S. inflation data for April came in a touch lower than expected and retail sales growth was notably weaker than anticipated. The precious metal remained strong after the data releases lowered U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar, and increased expectations for earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts, Commonwealth Bank of Australia says in a note. Markets are now pricing in around an 85% chance of a Fed interest rate cut by September, compared to around 75% prior to the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index data on Wednesday, CBA says. Gold prices are typically inversely related to interest rates; higher rates for longer diminish the appeal of non-interest bearing bullion. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

Oil Prices Rise on Positive Inflation Data, Stockpile Falls -- Market Talk

0757 GMT - Oil prices rise, with Brent set to finish the week up on positive economic data and a fall in inventories. Brent crude is up 0.4% at $83.61 a barrel, while WTI rises 0.3% to $79.44 a barrel. Positive sentiment toward oil is being supported by the second consecutive weekly fall in U.S. crude oil stockpiles, while signs of slowing inflation added to the bullish mood, ANZ Research analysts say in a note. The market is awaiting OPEC's next move, with three possible scenarios for the June 1 meeting--extend, unwind or completely remove the voluntary cuts of 2.2 million barrels a day, ANZ says. An extension is the most likely outcome--ANZ models removing the cuts could lead prices to fall as low as $75 a barrel, while an extension could produce deficits and push prices as high as $100 a barrel.

A stabilization in EUR/USD around 1.08/1.09 or some modest downside pressure is ING's expectation for the near term.

""Our view for the near term remains that we could see a further stabilization in USD crosses as markets await the next key data input: April core PCE on 31 May,"" ING said.

EUR/USD may be lacking enough support to break decisively above 1.0900 before the weekend, even though that doesn't look like a very strong technical resistance, it added.

The dollar should weaken further over the medium term, UBS said.

""While the dollar may be supported in the near term as the ECB and the Bank of England are likely to start lowering rates ahead of the Fed, we expect modest USD depreciation as growth outside the U.S. improves.""

Sterling was relatively unchanged in the absence of major market-moving data releases.

U.K. inflation data is due on Wednesday and a softer-than-expected reading is likely to see the pound edge lower while a stronger reading is likely to support the pound, Monex Europe said.

Bonds:

If the ECB avoids boosting expectations of an interest-rate cut at its July meeting, U.S. data and market expectations for Fed rates will remain an important driver of eurozone bonds through the summer, SEB Research said.

In line with the majority of the market, SEB Research expects a first ECB rate cut in June, coupled with a cautious message regarding the prospect of further cuts.

Societe Generale Research said the net supply of eurozone government bonds will likely be positive in June but investors' risk sentiment is likely to be the main driver of spreads.

Net supply is likely to be positive especially in France, Spain and Italy, in line with seasonal patterns, it added.

""While important for EGB [eurozone government bond] spreads, investor risk sentiment will, in our view, be the main driver in the coming months.""

Barring a significant weakening of demand, the strategists don't expect supply to have a significant impact on country spreads, SocGen said.

SocGen also said German Bunds look to offer more value versus Treasurys during the countdown to ECB interest-rate cuts, but major rallies in Bunds are unlikely.

The 10-year Treasury yield is likely to edge lower, based on the daily chart, UOB said.

Earlier this week, the yield dropped to clearly break below support on its ascending trend line and its 55-day exponential moving average, it noted. Downward momentum has increased with breach of these two support levels, though it's not sufficient to suggest the beginning of a sustained fall in the yield.

However, there seems potential for the yield to inch lower in the coming month, with initial support at the daily Ichimoku cloud's bottom, UOB said.

Energy:

Oil prices rose, as positive sentiment was being supported by the second consecutive weekly fall in U.S. crude oil stockpiles, while signs of slowing inflation added to the bullish mood, ANZ Research said.

The market is awaiting OPEC's next move, with three possible scenarios for the June 1 meeting--extend, unwind or completely remove the voluntary cuts of 2.2 million barrels a day, ANZ said.

An extension is the most likely outcome--ANZ models removing the cuts could lead prices to fall as low as $75 a barrel, while an extension could produce deficits and push prices as high as $100 a barrel.

Metals:

Gold edged higher, holding ground after U.S. data releases lowered Treasury yields and the dollar, and increased expectations for earlier Fed rate cuts, Commonwealth Bank of Australia said.

Tencent's Top Shareholder Taps New Chief in AI Ramp-Up

Tencent Holdings top shareholder Prosus and its parent company Naspers named Fabricio Bloisi as their new chief executive as the tech investors seek to chart a new course for the age of artificial intelligence.

Naspers made a $34 million bet on Chinese tech giant Tencent more than twenty years ago that turned into a multibillion-dollar investment and made it the WeChat maker's biggest shareholder. However, it has grappled for years with a discount between its own market value and that of its stake in Tencent.

Trump vs. Biden: How the Dow's Performance Compares

The Dow Jones Industrial Average's first foray above 40000, though brief, is the latest sign the economy has shrugged off the threat of recession in the midst of retreating inflation and hopes for lower interest rates. It is one bit of welcome news for President Biden, whose approval-and re-election prospects-are being held down by public dissatisfaction with the economy.

On X, Biden called the milestone ""great news for Americans' retirement accounts and another sign of confidence in America's economy.""

The stock market isn't the economy, but it is the most prominent, and most frequently updated, benchmark of financial and economic performance. How strong a case, then, does it make for Biden? Superficially, pretty strong. As of Thursday's close, the Dow is up 28% since he was inaugurated in January 2021-a respectable run. It is also slightly more than where the Dow was at the same point of Donald Trump's presidency.

China Is Finally Getting Serious About a Housing Rescue

China rolled out its boldest steps yet to fix its broken housing market, as Beijing sought to finally bring to an end a drawn-out real-estate crunch that has hobbled its economy for years.

The centerpiece of measures outlined Friday is Beijing's embrace of a policy already being tested in some cities in China-getting city and local authorities to buy up unsold or unfinished homes and convert them into affordable housing for low- and middle-income families.

China Consumption and Investment Slow Unexpectedly

China's consumption and investment slowed unexpectedly in April, while industrial output beat expectations as Beijing doubled down on its manufacturing drive to spur growth amid a prolonged property slump and growing trade tensions with the West.

Retail sales, a major gauge of consumption, increased 2.3% in April from a year earlier, down from the 3.1% growth recorded in March and the 4.0% rise expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

Biden's Urgent Push to Win Black Voters Starts Now

ATLANTA-President Biden is courting Black voters this weekend in a flurry of high-profile events, in a bid to reclaim support among a once-reliable voting bloc now showing a lack of enthusiasm.

The marquee event is delivering the commencement address at Morehouse College, the prestigious, all-male historically Black college and the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Sunday. After his speech at Morehouse, the president is flying to Detroit to speak at a large NAACP chapter dinner there.

The company, which produces, transports and sells gas and electricity, said earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), excluding nuclear, totalled 3.7 billion euros ($4.02 billion), versus 3.8 billion euros in the same period of 2023.

""We've started the year pretty well, despite less favourable conditions than last year as the market stabilises, which shows the resilience of our business model,"" said finance chief Pierre-Francois Riolacci.

Engie in recent years has sought to sell off assets and refocus on its core business of natural gas infrastructure and sales, while spending the profits on renewables.

Profits at oil and gas firms are still retreating from 2022 records, when natural gas prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Spot gas prices in Europe have tumbled about 40% in the last year, hit by mild winter weather and easing supply worries.

Engie's revenues for the quarter fell 24.6% to 22 billion euros, it said.

Overall, the company said it made 136 million euros less across distribution networks and sales because winter temperatures in France were higher than normal.

Much of the decline was offset by renewables, largely thanks to higher hydroelectric production in France, and flexible generation businesses.

Engie increased its renewable assets by buying two biogas sites in the Netherlands, acquiring Orsted's portfolio of French onshore wind farms, and securing financing for newly commissioned wind and solar projects in the United States totalling 1.3 gigawatts (GW).

The company also won a 1.3 GW offshore wind contract in Australia via Ocean Winds, its joint venture with EDP, and started up a battery storage project in Chile

Engie has been unable to find a buyer for its loss-making subsidiary EV Box, which makes electric vehicle charging stations and software, and now hopes to sell off individual sites.

""It's an activity that has suffered in recent years ... with the Ukraine crisis and soaring energy prices, plus national governments revising their subsidy schemes leading to a massive slowdown in installations,"" Riolacci said.

""We've done all we could to set the company right, but in the end it's not our main business,"" he added, saying it was premature to discuss closures or layoffs for some 700 workers in mostly the Netherlands.

Engie said it was still targeting an annual net recurring income on a group share basis of 4.2-4.8 billion euros.

A growing number of companies are encouraging their employees to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams in-house -- a trend known as intrapreneurship. Some managers do this by providing workers with the financial, human and material resources required for innovation. For example, Google has long encouraged employees to devote 20% of their working hours to side projects unrelated to their daily jobs. Others firms unleash workplace creativity by clearly stating the types of innovations they're after.

Encouraging measured risks

Another less obvious and yet potentially game-changing method consists in tolerating, if not celebrating, failure. It's common sense that rewards can act as ""carrots"" to encourage intrapreneurship -- a concept we associate with success. But what if failure were just as important?

To create an organizational culture that boosts innovative intrapreneurial process, tolerating failure can be a first step. This can encourage employees to be more confident and to take measured risks -- provided that this tolerance is made explicit to employees.

It's also about encouraging the idea that learning can come from failure. Every stumble can be transformed into an opportunity because it helps us uncover new problems or different perspectives. An intrapreneur faced with an impasse acquires knowledge that she or he would not otherwise have been able to obtain. If someone else took over the project, they wouldn't have been exposed to the same challenges, nor have the same learning as the original person.

Pitching a failure

It is possible to go even further. In a case study on the French energy company Engie, we looked at their decision to give ""best failed ideas"" awards to employees who dared -- and failed -- to realize their innovative ideas.

We analyzed how Engie began to consider failed projects, not just to show a form of tolerance, but also to promote them within the company so that everyone can learn from them.

Despite being based on good ideas, some projects end up failing. They can be seen as quasi-successes, however, because sometimes it's the company that decides to call them to an end. These are neither failures nor successes. Instead, they're near-successes, also known as ""nearlings"". These projects did not achieve the desired results for the firm, particularly in terms of profitability, but when carried out rigorously, they provided learning opportunities for the whole company.

The energy giant has even taken up the original idea of creating a category within its ""innovation trophies"" called ""best failed idea"". The practice had already been popularized by Ratan Tata, head of a major Indian industrial group. It was an initiative by the company's innovation manager to reward the best ideas that had ""failed"", and the group experimented with the scheme from 2016 to 2020.

The selection procedure was not the same as for the other trophy categories, where project leaders apply spontaneously. Instead, the group's innovation director canvassed candidates directly, acknowledging that presenting a failure was not easy.

The eventual winner of the ""best failed idea"" prize had a project whose development potential the company doubted and thus wasn't financed. In a three-minute pitch, he was able to highlight what he had learned from the process, and the jury found his perseverance convincing. One of the members of the jury, a senior executive in the group, invited him to a private meeting -- he had the intuition that while the idea had not been retained in its original context, it could be of use to his product line. Without this trophy category, the director would probably never have heard of the project.

'Best Nearling'

And what if this type of initiative were to become widespread? Initiatives rewarding failure, which go beyond simply celebrating mistakes, are on the rise within large companies such as Google, Australia's MacQuarie Telecom, the US accounting firm Intuit, the chemical firm Huntsman and the textile giant WLGore. Perhaps the name could be changed to ""Best Nearling"" to reassure employees who are reluctant to tell top management that they have failed, even if for the right reasons.",interaksyon.philstar.com,news,Interaksyon,,0.4039215686274509,453632575,6,https://media.interaksyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/trophy.jpg,

The French multinational power utility on Friday posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 5.4 billion euro ($5.87 billion) in the first three months of the year, 0.7% lower on an organic basis than in the same period last year.

The dip was driven by sharp declines from its networks and global energy management and sales businesses, although these were largely offset by rising earnings from renewables, flexible generations and energy solutions, the company said.

Similarly, EBIT excluding earnings from nuclear power fell 3.7% to EUR3.7 billion.

Revenue dropped 25% to EUR22.0 billion, while cash flow from operations--a measure of cash generated from normal business operations--rose 36% to EUR5.1 billion thanks to improvement in working capital.

Paris-based Engie--one of the biggest energy companies in Europe--reaffirmed its expectations for they year, still targeting EBIT excluding nuclear between EUR7.5 billion and EUR8.5, along net recurring income of between EUR4.2 billion and EUR4.8 billion.

The company, which produces, transports and sells gas and electricity, said earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), excluding nuclear, were 3.7 billion euros ($4.02 billion), compared with 3.8 billion euros in the same period of 2023.

""We've started the year pretty well, despite less favourable conditions than last year as the market stabilises, which shows the resilience of our business model,"" said CFO Pierre-Francois Riolacci.

Profits at oil and gas firms are still retreating from 2022 records, when natural gas prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Spot gas prices in Europe have tumbled about 40% in the last year hit by mild winter weather and easing supply worries.

Revenues for the quarter fell 24.6% to 22 billion euros, the company said.

Overall, Engie said it made 136 million euros less across distribution networks and sales, because winter temperatures in France were higher than normal.

Less market volatility also eroded trading opportunities, which had contributed outsized profits in recent years.

Much of the decline was offset by its renewables and flexible generation businesses, however.

The company said it was still targeting an annual net recurring income on a group share basis of between 4.2 billion and 4.8 billion euros.

Opening Call:

Shares could lose ground in Europe on Friday, following hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers. In Asia, stock benchmarks were mixed; Treasury yields were also mixed; the dollar gained; while oil rose and gold fell.

Equities:

European shares look set to retreat on Friday, as hawkish Fedspeak counters relatively soft U.S. economic data.

Fed officials Loretta Mester and Thomas Barkin signaled overnight that higher U.S. rates are here to stay for now.

Focus will likely be on fresh economic data out of China, which showed consumption and investment slowed unexpectedly in April, while industrial output beat expectations.

The broadly weaker economic readings may raise doubts about whether the worst is indeed over for China's economy, IG said.

The dollar slightly strengthened in Asia, supported by bets that U.S. interest rates will stay high, which would sustain the allure of U.S. fixed-income assets and demand for the greenback.

The narrative of high-for-longer U.S. rates continues to keep dollar supported on dips, Maybank said.

This high-for-longer rate stance seems to be the message from several Fed officials who spoke overnight, it added.

Bonds:

Treasury yields were mixed after an overnight rally on hawkish comments from Federal Reserve policymakers.

U.S. indicators did little to change markets' bets on interest rate cuts later this year, but Fed officials Mester and Barkin reinforced the message that prices still look too hot despite April's relatively mild print.

No major U.S. indicators are due until existing home sales next Wednesday.

Energy:

Oil edged higher, aided by prospects of Fed rate cuts which would help support the U.S. economy and energy demand.

A weakening dollar, along with hopes of stronger oil demand in the second half, have helped buyers to muster up the strength to support oil prices around current levels, said IG.

While oil prices have experienced a volatile period so far in May, it looks as though prices are forming a low, IG added.

Metals:

Gold slipped after earlier gains on hopes for Fed rate cuts, which would enhance the allure of the non-interest-bearing precious metal.

The U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing down, which underpins a relatively dovish stance from the Fed, said Saxo Bank.

Once the rate cut cycle starts later this year, gold will probably see renewed demand from exchange-traded-fund investors, it added.

Copper edged lower in a likely technical correction.

Prices tested a new high overnight, supported by news of more Chinese local government support for the slumping property market, Sucden Financial said.

Broader sentiment remains supported by the prospect of Fed rate cuts after the U.S. CPI fell more than expected, ANZ Research said.

Iron ore rose amid renewed optimism over China's efforts to tackle the property crisis, ANZ Research said.

Investor sentiment was boosted by a media report that authorities are considering letting local governments buy unsold homes from distressed developers, it said.

Attention will be on the key briefing by housing and financial regulators later in the day about policies to ensure housing delivery.

TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES

China Consumption and Investment Slow Unexpectedly

China's consumption and investment slowed unexpectedly in April, while industrial output beat expectations as Beijing doubled down on its manufacturing drive to spur growth amid a prolonged property slump and growing trade tensions with the West.

Retail sales, a major gauge of consumption, increased 2.3% in April from a year earlier, down from the 3.1% growth recorded in March and the 4.0% rise expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

Fed's Barkin says consumers are driving inflation. Here's what they're willing to pay more for.

Inflation is being fueled by the service sector, while goods producers have been chastened by experience, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said Thursday.

The service sector - essentially the people we pay to mow our lawns, take care of our children, and keep our homes free of pests - still believes consumers will accept higher prices and they are going to continue to raise them until households balk, Barkin said in an interview on CNBC.

France Rushes Reinforcements to Riot-Stricken New Caledonia

France is rushing security reinforcements to its overseas territory of New Caledonia, a crucial foothold for Paris in the Indo-Pacific, after days of violent riots that have led to the deaths of at least five people and raised difficult questions over the archipelago's future and France's broader role in the region.

French authorities said Thursday that 1,000 police officers were on their way to the territory, while the army was being deployed to secure ports and the main airport. Around 1,700 police officers are already present in New Caledonia, where rioters have burned buildings, looted shops and set up road barricades, they added.

Netanyahu Pacifies Israel's Far Right and Alienates Everyone Else to Survive

TEL AVIV-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the Gaza war is frustrating almost everyone with a stake in the fight, including his allies.

The U.S. wants at least a temporary cease-fire. Israeli security officials, including the defense minister, want a plan for who will rule postwar Gaza. And hostage families want their loved ones home.

Opening Call:

Shares could lose ground in Europe on Friday, following hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers. In Asia, stock benchmarks were mixed; Treasury yields were also mixed; the dollar gained; while oil rose and gold fell.

Equities:

European shares look set to retreat on Friday, as hawkish Fedspeak counters relatively soft U.S. economic data.

Fed officials Loretta Mester and Thomas Barkin signaled overnight that higher U.S. rates are here to stay for now.

Focus will likely be on fresh economic data out of China, which showed consumption and investment slowed unexpectedly in April, while industrial output beat expectations.

The 33-year-old defender started his career at Hawthorn after he was picked up in the 2009 draft before debuting in the brown and gold in 2013.

He played 118 games for the Hawks including the 2014 and 2015 Grand Final triumphs, and then found his way to the Bulldogs in late 2018.

During his time at his first club, Duryea played with several superstars of the game including Lance 'Buddy' Franklin, Luke Hodge, Sam Mitchell and Jarryd Roughead, among others.

Add to that the current Dogs captain Marcus Bontempelli and it's a fairly formidable list.

""'Buddy' just goes number one. You just can't look past his career, his numbers and his impact on the game,"" Duryea said on SEN's The Run Home.

""But then it's 'Bont'. As good as Sam Mitchell or 'Hodgey' or 'Roughy' or whoever have been, it's got to be Bont, for sure.

""Buddy might be the best player or talent, but Bont is probably the most impactful player in terms of leadership, his ability to play as a midfielder who goes goal line to goal line.

""He's just a freak.""

Bontempelli, 28, owns a scary football CV which includes a premiership of his own plus five best and fairest awards, five All-Australian selections, two AFLPA MVPs, a pair of AFLPA best captain awards and myriad other individual awards.

With some more success, could 'The Bont' take Buddy's mantle as Duryea's best ever teammate?

""I'm not someone who sits there and says Jonathan Brown is a better player than Nick Riewoldt because he has three premierships,"" he replied.

""I know we're in this era of rings, particularly in American sport, where someone's resumé is decided by rings.

""I don't think I need to see that for me to say whether Bont is the best player I've ever played with, but I think it would be just recognition for him. I feel like he's been stiff in a couple of Brownlow counts.

""If we can get another flag or two for him, then I guess it holds up as one of the better careers we've seen, especially in modern times.""

As a defender of 181cm, Duryea has stood some of the competition's very best medium and small forwards.

Without ranking them in order, he has come up with a top five of the most difficult opponents he has faced over the course of his 199 games.

""I would say overall it's those small forwards that have a marking ability,"" Duryea said.

""So, Eddie Betts in years gone by, or Robbie Gray, those type of guys.

""More recently it's been Toby Greene or Jamie Elliott or even Charlie Cameron.

""If I were to give it a top five, it would be those guys.""

The clash with the Giants at Engie Stadium will be Duryea's 82nd for the Dogs and 200th overall.

A spotlight has been shone on Greene's lean form in recent weeks, with the 30-year-old star conceding his output has been down after a career-best season last year.

Greene has managed only 11 goals from eight games this season in his lowest scoring rate since 2015 - except for 2020 when games were shortened.

But Kingsley feels Greene is being judged harshly and said the Giants measure their leader's contribution well beyond the scoreboard.

""He's still having an enormous impact for us,"" Kingsley told reporters ahead of Saturday's important home clash with the Western Bulldogs.

""The simple reality is he's not walking away with three or four goals every week, so maybe his impact gets glossed over, but I'm sure that finish will return pretty quickly.

""One thing with a key forward is you can sort of be off your game but it can turn really quickly and we're hoping (Saturday) is the day.""

Kingsley conceded parts of Greene's game ""aren't quite at the level they were last year"" as he strives to rekindle the form that led to him being named All-Australian captain in 2023.

""His finishing, he's not quite getting that done, and perhaps his contest is a little down"" Kingsley said.

""In terms of one-on-one contests he's normally a little bit better, but that will come, I'm really confident in that.

""What we can't overlook is the fact he still ranks 'elite' for possessions for his position, inside-50s, ground balls, marks, score assists and score involvements.""

One GWS forward who has made goal umpires do plenty of work this season is Jesse Hogan, who will play his 150th AFL game against the Bulldogs.

The former Fremantle and Melbourne spearhead has found a home at the Giants in recent seasons after a turbulent start to his career beset by injuries, personal battles and illness.

Hogan kicked a career-best 49 goals last year and is on track to better that mark this season, firmly in the Coleman Medal race with 26 majors in nine games.

""His start to the season has been really good for us. He provides a big target on the field for us, a reliable target,"" Kingsley said.

""But off the field he's equally important, particularly to our young key forwards. We've got a few of them; Jake Riccardi, Aaron Cadman, Max Gruzewski.

""They're young keys who are still finding their way and learning their craft and Jesse's certainly one who's experienced but also very knowledgeable in the details and the intricacies of being a key forward.

""His ability to pass on that knowledge has been invaluable so far and I'm sure he'll continue to do that.""

Contracted until the end of next year, Beveridge faced intense scrutiny this season as the Bulldogs slipped to 3-5 before a 91-point thrashing of struggling Richmond last week.

Johannisen, who starred in the Dogs' 2016 premiership under Beveridge, said it was on the players to deliver on a more consistent basis, starting against Greater Western Sydney at Engie Stadium on Saturday.

Norm Smith medallist Johannisen will miss the round-10 contest with a tight hamstring, replaced by flag teammate Caleb Daniel, but backed the Bulldogs to perform in support of their coach.

""We feel that frustration and us players take ownership for our poor performances,"" Johannisen told AAP.

""We've just had to go back to the basics and what makes us play really well.

""Our pressure game was unbelievable (last week) and our contest work and our midfielders were tremendous.

""The challenge is to do that for the next few weeks.""

Beveridge has been the lightning rod for criticism during the Bulldogs' rollercoaster start to the season, with many detractors claiming the 53-year-old isn't getting the best out of a talented list.

There have been queries over some of Beveridge's selection decisions, while he has also been been accused of sending mixed messages through the media.

""He cops way too much criticism that is unwarranted,"" Johannisen said.

""Us players and the whole coaching staff feel like we have a good culture and good environment and all we do week in week out is try to get better.

""It just hasn't been coming through in our games but hopefully now we've kick-started that and can get some good momentum.""

GWS (6-3) will be looking to steady their own ship when they play on home turf for the first time in more than two months.

Adam Kingsley's men have lost three of their past four games, following a club-record five-match winning streak to start the season.

Johannisen said stopping the Giants' hard-running engine room - led by Tom Green, Stephen Coniglio and Callan Ward - would be crucial to the Bulldogs posting a win that could be a launching pad for a run at the top eight.

""We know how well they move the ball; it's very fast and they run in numbers, so if we can play the game in our forward half it will go a long way,"" Johannisen said.

""In the past we've had big wins on the road and it really lifts the boys up and can give a team such momentum going forward.

""The Giants are one of the top teams, so if we get a win it's going to be huge.""

GWS suffered a double-blow with Josh Kelly and Lachie Ash both ruled out for about six weeks with calf injuries, naming Xavier O'Halloran and Jacob Wehr as replacements against the Bulldogs.

Contracted until the end of next year, Beveridge faced intense scrutiny this season as the Bulldogs slipped to 3-5 before a 91-point thrashing of struggling Richmond last week.

Johannisen, who starred in the Dogs' 2016 premiership under Beveridge, said it was on the players to deliver on a more consistent basis, starting against Greater Western Sydney at Engie Stadium on Saturday.

Norm Smith medallist Johannisen will miss the round-10 contest with a tight hamstring, replaced by flag teammate Caleb Daniel, but backed the Bulldogs to perform in support of their coach.

""We feel that frustration and us players take ownership for our poor performances,"" Johannisen told AAP.

""We've just had to go back to the basics and what makes us play really well.

""Our pressure game was unbelievable (last week) and our contest work and our midfielders were tremendous.

""The challenge is to do that for the next few weeks.""

Beveridge has been the lightning rod for criticism during the Bulldogs' rollercoaster start to the season, with many detractors claiming the 53-year-old isn't getting the best out of a talented list.

There have been queries over some of Beveridge's selection decisions, while he has also been been accused of sending mixed messages through the media.

""He cops way too much criticism that is unwarranted,"" Johannisen said.

""Us players and the whole coaching staff feel like we have a good culture and good environment and all we do week in week out is try to get better.

""It just hasn't been coming through in our games but hopefully now we've kick-started that and can get some good momentum.""

GWS (6-3) will be looking to steady their own ship when they play on home turf for the first time in more than two months.

Adam Kingsley's men have lost three of their past four games, following a club-record five-match winning streak to start the season.

Johannisen said stopping the Giants' hard-running engine room - led by Tom Green, Stephen Coniglio and Callan Ward - would be crucial to the Bulldogs posting a win that could be a launching pad for a run at the top eight.

""We know how well they move the ball; it's very fast and they run in numbers, so if we can play the game in our forward half it will go a long way,"" Johannisen said.

""In the past we've had big wins on the road and it really lifts the boys up and can give a team such momentum going forward.

""The Giants are one of the top teams, so if we get a win it's going to be huge.""

GWS suffered a double-blow with Josh Kelly and Lachie Ash both ruled out for about six weeks with calf injuries, naming Xavier O'Halloran and Jacob Wehr as replacements against the Bulldogs.

""In particular, after recent Russian strikes caused significant damage to Ukrainian energy infrastructure... we can understand that the market is a little worried,"" they said.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, causing significant damage and blackouts in many regions.

Concerns over possible disruptions to gas supply also increased after Ukraine warned of a Russian force buildup in the north near its Sumy region in the vicinity of the Russian town of Sudzha from where Russian natural gas transits into Ukraine by pipe on its way to European customers.

Flows, however, have remained stable. Russia's Gazprom said that it would send 42.4 million cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Thursday, a volume broadly in line with recent days.

High gas stocks are also helping keep prices muted.

""EU gas stocks look healthy at two-thirds full. At the current injection rate, it would reach the mandated levels of at least 90% long before the November deadline,"" analysts at Auxilione said.

Europe's gas stores are currently 65.8 full according to latest Gas Infrastructure Europe data.

A panel session during this year's Invest in African Energy (IAE) 2024 forum explored strategies to unlock financing for renewable energy projects across the continent.

Taking place in Paris on May 14, the session, which included independent power producer ENGIE Energy Access, featured a robust discussion around solar energy deployment.

Committed to raising electrification rates across the continent, the company is developing a $60 million mini-grid project in Nigeria, which is set for completion by 2026 and is poised to connect over 150,000 people to the grid.

""More than 600 million people lack access to electricity, and ENGIE Access' goal is to bridge this gap,"" stated ENGIE Energy Access Head of Funding Marie Testard, adding, ""ENGIE Energy Access is the energy access company that aims to deploy this solution in sub-Saharan Africa, and so far, we have a presence in nine countries, building almost 10 GW of mini-grids.""

Meanwhile, having secured $222.5 million in commitments from African institutional investors in January, pan-African infrastructure investment platform Africa50 Group is well positioned to deploy a pipeline of renewable energy infrastructure projects.

The fund is poised to play a vital role in addressing the continent's energy needs while promoting inclusive and sustainable development.

""The African continent has a lot of renewable resources and the highest solar potential in the world, with only 5 GW of installed solar capacity so far,"" stated Africa50 Infrastructure Investment Platform Strategy Director Molly Gbodimowo, adding, ""Overall, Africa requires $277 billion annually to implement its 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.""

Underscoring the pivotal role of public-private partnerships and innovative financing mechanisms in driving renewable energy initiatives, the speakers stressed the importance of local institutions and a favourable investment environment in Africa.

Or follow us on Google News!

The US Department of Energy has poured a ton of figurative blood, sweat, and tears into supporting innovative floating platforms for offshore wind turbines, only to see them float off to Europe where public policy support for offshore wind development runs strong. Now that the US is finally getting its policy ducks in the water, made-in-the-USA floating wind platforms are finally coming home.

Floating wind turbine platforms are an engineering challenge, but the Energy Department has been pitching them as the key to opening up vast offshore wind resources in deep water, where conventional fixed-bottom platforms are impractical if not impossible (see more floating wind news here).

One focus of Energy Department support for the US floating wind industry has been the firm Principle Power, which first crossed the CleanTechnica radar back in 2009. It's been a long road but finally the end is in sight.

""By 2014 Principle Power was demonstrating its floating wind power technology off the coast of Oregon, again with the support of the US Department of Energy, and the company has continued to help shepherd the floating wind industry along here in the US,"" we reported back in 2021.

Unfortunately for US offshore wind fans, that helpfulness had yet to materialize in domestic waters as of 2021, but Principle Power was laying the groundwork for its come-home moment, eventually.

In 2019 the company teamed up in a consortium to win a $3.6 million grant from the Energy Department's ARPA-E high risk, high reward funding office. The grant supported the development of new software billed as ""the world's first digital twin software tailored to floating offshore wind applications.""

""This digital twin model will be a real-time, high-fidelity numerical representation of the WindFloat Atlantic (WFA) Project, which will be one of the world's first floating offshore wind farms,"" Principle Power enthused in a press statement.

They also noted that WindFloat Atlantic is off the coat of northern Portugal, not the US. However, Sam Kanner, R&D Lead at Principle Power, explained that the new ""DigiFloat"" software will go to benefit the whole floating offshore wind industry, with the anticipation of reduced downtime and reduced costs, among other benefits.

WindFloat Atlantic was up and running in 2020, leaving the US floating wind industry even farther behind in the dust. Nevertheless, the project -- a venture joining Principle Power with the European energy firms EDP Renewables, Engie, and Repsol -- serves as a global showcase that can help the US offshore wind industry kick into high gear.

By the end of 2023, the three semi-submersible floating turbines at WindFloat Atlantic had generated 80 gigawattt-hours of electricity, exceeding production expectations while battling killer storms, including one with wave heights of 20 meters and wind gusts of 139 kilometers per hour.",cleantechnica.com,news,CleanTechnica,Tina Casey,0.2705882352941176,453563202,1,https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/floating-offshore-wind-principle-power-800x414.png,eng-9566306

Non-disclosure or inadequate disclosure of commission arrangements to the customer places the supplier and the broker at risk of claims. In cases where neither the existence nor amount of commission is disclosed (fully secret commission cases), there is little room for the supplier or the broker to manoeuvre and the customer will likely have a claim for damages for fraud and potentially be entitled to rescind the agreement. In cases where the existence of the commission is disclosed but not the amount (known as half-secret commission), the position is more nuanced, requiring analysis of the scope of the broker's duty as to whether any liability arises.

The Court of Appeal has recently considered fully and half-secret commission in the context of lending in the Wood and Pengelly cases.These cases confirmed that payment of a fully secret commission amounted to bribery and, in those circumstances, for the claim to succeed no fiduciary duty was required, only a duty to provide disinterested advice, recommendation or information. In 'half secret' cases, a fiduciary relationship is required, and non-disclosure of the amount of commission may not be enough to establish a breach of duty - the information gap must be such that the party acquiring the product or service did not give informed consent to the commission payment (informed consent being necessary to displace a conflict of interest).

The recent case of Expert Tooling and Automation Limited v Engie Power Limited provides an illustration of how these principles will be applied to commission payments in the context of energy supply contracts.

Expert Tooling and Automation Limited (Expert Tooling) was a tool manufacturer with industrial sites across the Midlands and Northeast. Engie Power Limited (Engie) supplied the electricity required for Expert Tooling's manufacturing process through a number of contracts. Engie used Utilitywise plc (UW) as a broker to procure these contracts. Expert Tooling was aware that UW would be paid commission in return for the brokerage but did not know how much (or how the payment would be structured). UW went into administration in 2019 and was dissolved in 2022. Expert Tooling subsequently brought a claim against Engie alleging that UW acted in breach of its fiduciary duties as agent to Expert Tooling in relation to its receipt of commission payments and that Engie was liable as accessory to that breach. Expert Tooling alleged that UW had breached obligations of ""trust, confidence and single-minded loyalty"", as the commission structure created an inevitable conflict of interest, where ""UW's duty to obtain the best deal for the claimant [Expert Tooling] inevitably conflicted with its own interest in maximising its commission"". Expert Tooling also made an additional claim that UW had breached the implied terms of its contract with Expert Tooling to act in good faith and in their best interests and that this breach had been induced by Engie. The court rejected all of Expert Tooling's claims and in doing so provided a useful analysis of the approach to commission disclosure in the context of commercial energy contracts.

As the case was about half-secret commissions, liability would only arise if (a) UW owed a fiduciary duty to Expert Tooling and (b) the scope of that duty required UW to disclose the amount of commission.

It was accepted that UW, as broker, was the agent of Expert Tooling. However, Engie disputed that UW owed a fiduciary duty. Under the terms of their agreements, UW had the power to enter into contracts on behalf of Expert Tooling and had done so. The court had no difficulty in finding this kind of relationship between an intermediary and principal, where the intermediary had the power to affect the legal relations of its principal, came ""within the scope of a fiduciary relationship"".

Having found that a fiduciary duty existed, the question for the court was whether the scope of the fiduciary duty owed by UW to Expert Tooling required UW to disclose the amount of commission it received or how it was structured. Drawing principles from previous half-secret commission cases, the court identified factors which defined the scope of the broker's duty, including the level of sophistication and vulnerability of the principal, as well as market expectation or relevant trade usage and customs.

On the question of sophistication, the court considered two previous contrasting cases. In Medsted Associates Ltd v Canaccord Genuity Wealth, a half-secret commission case in the financial services sector, the court found no breach of fiduciary duty where the Claimants, two wealthy Greek citizens, were likely to be experienced investors, therefore indicating that a smaller scope of duty was owed to them, and not requiring disclosure of the amount of commission. In contrast, in McWilliam, the principals were financially unsophisticated, of modest means, with previous credit issues and considered vulnerable, which necessitated a fiduciary duty with a wider scope, requiring the amount of commission to be disclosed, otherwise the potential conflict of interest would not be evident to the principal.

Assessing the scope of the fiduciary duty, it is not only sophistication which defines the scope, but also the specifics of the principal's knowledge, set in the relevant context. On this question, the Judge considered the case of FHR European Ventures where a wide scope of fiduciary duty was found to be owed, requiring the disclosure of the amount of commission, not because the principal was vulnerable or unsophisticated (it was a financial institution) but because the amount of the commission was not an amount driven by custom and practice and was a ""significantly larger percentage than would have been expected"".

Deriving guidance from the principles in these previous cases, the Judge in Expert Tooling found that the need to advise on the amount of commission was not in the scope of UW's duties to Expert Tooling and, therefore, there had been no breach of duty. In reaching this conclusion, the Judge had regard to the fact that: (a) Expert Tooling was neither vulnerable nor unsophisticated - it was represented by two employees with experience in negotiating energy contracts; and (b) payment of commission to brokers was standard and had been addressed in an Ofgem factsheet which explained, where a principal did not make direct payment to an intermediary, the intermediary would be paid by the supplier and charged to the customer in the tariff it pays. The Judge also noted that, after being informed that commission was payable, all the representatives of Expert Tooling needed to do was ask the amount and how it would be calculated, but for whatever reason they did not.

If disclosure of the amount of commission comes within the scope of the fiduciary duty, breach of duty can be avoided if the principal (i.e. Expert Tooling) has given informed consent to the agent (i.e. Expert Tooling) to act on the principal's behalf notwithstanding the conflict of interests, or if ""trade custom and usage acquit the agent from specifically seeking it"". As the Judge had found disclosure was not within the scope of the fiduciary duty owed by UW, the question of informed consent was academic. In any event, the matters required to be considered to determine whether there is informed consent have significant overlap with those going to the scope of fiduciary duty such as vulnerability, sophistication and market practice. Given the knowledge of Expert Tooling's representatives, both of commission being paid and of the receipt of other services such as an account manager and a smart meter, in addition to the provision of electricity, ""all of which it could not seriously have thought the defendant would pay for"" and the fact that Expert Tooling was represented by sophisticated businessmen well-versed in energy contracts, the Judge considered informed consent was easily established. In addition, and importantly for other similar cases, the Judge considered the need for informed consent would be removed by the fact that adding commission to the unit cost was a ""known industry practice"" and Expert Tooling was ""taken to know of the trade custom and to have consented to it"".

Expert Tooling had tried to rely on previous authority in Hurstanger to argue that Engie, by paying the commission with the knowledge that UW was breaching its fiduciary duty, became an accessory to the breach. On this issue, the court, citing Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, held that for the defendant to be an accessory it also needed to be of a ""dishonest state of mind"". This was a much higher bar than having knowledge of the breach.

The court found ""there was no evidence of dishonesty"" and the defendant could therefore not be held to be an accessory.

The claim for inducement of breach of contract also failed, both on the evidence and because Expert Tooling had not put the required questions to Engie's witnesses. A term of ""good faith"" was not implied into the contract as a matter of law. Nor had there been any intention from Engie to induce UW to breach its contract with Expert Tooling. To the extent intention could be found from Engie turning a 'blind eye' to UW's conduct, the Judge did not consider a 'blind eye' had been turned given the terms of Engie's arrangements with UW and the fact that UW had told Engie on various occasions that it had disclosed commission arrangements to Expert Tooling.

The parties had entered into the most significant of the contracts (representing more than £100,000 of the £130,000 commission payment) more than six years before the claim was brought. The court therefore considered whether the claim was time-barred under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. Expert Tooling tried to rely on the Section 32 exception, where if ""any fact relevant to the plaintiff's right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant"", the commencement of the ordinary limitation period could be postponed. The fact in question was the undisclosed amount of commission. The court held that the amount of commission and the way it was paid to UW was in fact ""discoverable"" by Expert Tooling. They could, simply, have asked UW for that information when they were first informed of the existence of the commission. UW had not ""deliberately concealed"" this fact by not bothering to inform Expert Tooling.

There are many commission-related cases going through the courts from a range of industries. This case provides a cautionary tale to commercial customers pursuing commission claims specifically in the energy market but potentially with wider application. The question of the customer's knowledge and sophistication will be key, as well as industry custom and practice - irrespective of whether the commission was specifically known to the Claimant. The court may well take a hard-line in 'half-secret' commission cases where a commercial (or otherwise sophisticated) customer knew commission would be paid but chose at the time not to seek further information.",dentons.com,news,dentons.com,,-0.0117647058823529,453552030,62,https://www.dentons.com/-/media/images/website/background-images/gpof/patterns/adobestock_346191310.ashx,

Howard County Circuit Court Judge Lynn Murray ruled against a group of property owners who are seeking to stop a proposed 200 megawatt solar farm from being built near the town of Greentown and upheld a decision by the Howard County Board of Zoning Appeals to approve a special exception request from the project's developer, ENGIE North America.

The decision this month is a key legal victory for ENGIE, which is one of two companies planning on building a large-scale commercial solar farm, dubbed Emerald Green Solar, on land around the Duke Energy Greentown substation.

""We are pleased to learn of the Court's ruling in favor of the project,"" Tom Schoder, development manager for Emerald Green Solar, said in an emailed statement to the Tribune. ""We will continue to collaborate with stakeholders as we work toward building Emerald Green Solar. We look forward to investing over $250 million into Howard County.""

Murray's decision can be appealed, however. An email by the Tribune sent to Jason Kuchmay, the hired attorney for the property owners, seeking comment and an answer to whether or not the group plans to appeal, was not immediately returned.

The ruling comes two months after both sides participated in oral arguments in front of Murray and more than a year after the county BZA voted to approve the special exception request by the slim margin of 3-2.

THE ARGUMENTS AND RULING

The petitioners' arguments against the approval of the special exception largely centered around two main arguments: the project does not pose as a ""clear benefit"" for nearby property owners and ENGIE's Jan. 23, 2023, application for a special exception was not fundamentally different than two previous applications that were denied by the BZA.

Thus, they argue, the BZA was incorrect in their most recent decision -- an approval.

Murray, though, did not find the arguments compelling enough to show the approval by the BZA was ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of its discretion or other not in accordance with law,"" which was needed for a reversal.

""The law does not permit this court to reweigh the evidence,"" Murray wrote. ""Even if substantial evidence supports the denial of an application, the court cannot overturn the BZA's decision if substantial evidence also supports it.""

Murray cited testimony during the BZA meeting from Paul Wyman, former county commissioner, who argued the solar farm's estimated $20 million assessed value would benefit the county in increased assessed values and tax money for the local school district. He also cited an impact study by Kirkland Appraisals that concluded a number of commercial solar farm projects in Indiana and other states did not have a negative impact on neighboring property values in rural areas.

Murray also rejected another main argument from Kuchmay and property owners that the county zoning ordinance requires the BZA to make a written finding that the project was a ""clear benefit"" to adjacent properties.

The petitioners cite a part of the zoning ordinance which discusses guiding policy on ""district intent"" for agricultural districts.

Nowhere in that section of the zoning ordinance, though, Murray stated, does it require a ""clear benefit"" finding by the BZA.

Instead, the zoning ordinance only requires the following four written findings:

* The proposal will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community.

* The requirements and development standards for the requested use as described by the zoning ordinance will be met.

* Granting the exception will not subvert the general purposes served by the zoning ordinance and will not permanently injure other property or uses in the same district and vicinity.

* The proposed use will be consistent with the character of the district therein, the spirit and intent of the zoning ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan.

""If the Zoning Ordinance mandated that BZA make written determination that the Project constitutes clear benefit to adjacent properties, it would expressly state so, akin to its explicit requirement for the BZA to provide written findings enumerated in Section 7.08,"" Murray stated. ""Petitioners' argument asks the Court to read nonexistent requirement into the Ordinance, which the Court must not do.""

Murray also ruled there is ""no authority"" for the court to find that previous rejections by the BZA are at all binding to future decisions by the board. Rather, she said, the county zoning ordinance allows applicants to resubmit after six months if their application is denied -- which ENGIE did -- and clearly states, ""No previous applications shall set a precedence for any other application before the Board of Zoning.""

""Accepting Petitioners' argument -- essentially, that approval of related petition previously denied is per se arbitrary and capricious -- would render Section of the Howard County BZA Rules of Procedure meaningless,"" Murray stated. ""Even if the prior findings were binding in some way, the court cannot rely on findings from an earlier proceeding when the evidence the BZA considered at that earlier proceeding is not part of this record for this judicial review.""

The Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate law signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, hinges on tax credits to drive new investment in clean energy and other technologies.

It also opened the door for these credits to be bought and sold freely, enabling energy projects with little to no tax liability to swap them for cash from deep-pocketed investors seeking to offset more substantial tax burdens.

Evercore expects $47bn worth of the credits to come up for sale in 2024, the market's first full year of operations. The annual supply would surpass $100bn by 2030 under the terms of the law, the investment bank said.

The cash has been welcomed by developers of projects such as solar and wind farms after a bruising period of high interest rates and inflation.

An array of companies are shopping for credits to lower US tax bills. Schneider Electric, the French industrial group, announced a deal on Thursday to purchase manufacturing tax credits from solar-panel maker Silfab Solar. Its purchase follows an $80mn tax credit transfer agreement with French energy company Engie in February.

Blackstone, the private equity group entered what is called a ""hybrid"" deal. It partnered with renewable energy company Arevon on a $350mn traditional tax equity deal, where the tax credits were sold to investment bank Stifel.

""This really is a game-changer,"" said Howard Steinberg, managing director at Houlihan Lokey, an investment bank, which has seen a ""frenzy"" of interest from businesses. ""The purchase of the credits will be a fact of life for corporate taxpayers.""

The US has subsidised solar and wind projects with tax breaks for decades. But until the IRA, the terms required cumbersome partnerships between project developers and a group of financiers, mostly banks.

The IRA loosened constraints in this system by allowing the credits to be transferred to third parties with no direct exposure to a particular project.

""It's an essential part of the underwriting of the project,"" said Chris Taylor, head of GridStor, a battery storage company that sold tax credits to JPMorgan Chase in March.

Among the buyers and sellers have been companies in the oil and gas industry, many of which face big tax bills after high and volatile commodity prices delivered soaring profits. Last year Vitol, the world's largest independent oil trader, purchased $100mn worth of tax credits from Avangrid in one of the largest deals at the time. Vitol declined to comment.

Law firm Norton Rose Fulbright told the Financial Times it had worked on at least two tax credit transactions with oil majors last year, while a large US bank said that oil and gas companies made up 30 per cent of its tax credit sales.

""The oil majors are like anyone else. They are big corporations. They have large tax liabilities and they're looking to manage their effective tax rates,"" said Keith Martin, co-head of projects at Norton Rose Fulbright.

Drax, the UK-based electric generating company, is planning to build wood-pellet fuelled power plants worth $4bn in the US that will be eligible for tax credits for capturing carbon dioxide emissions. Ross McKenzie of Drax said the ability to sell tax credits was important to foreign investors such as his company, which ""don't currently have a large US tax liability"".

The sale of credits has even reached Hollywood. Four film projects at Radiant Media Studios depend on financing through sales of tax credits associated with solar farms owned by one of the production company's principals, in deals first reported by Variety magazine. Two of the films are being co-produced by Kelce, best known for being a professional American football player and the boyfriend of Taylor Swift. A representative for Kelce did not respond to a request for comment.

""It is a very welcome addition because in the industry, with streaming, there's a lot of changes in the consumption of content. It's a very challenging environment,"" said Ray Maiello of Radiant Media Studios.

While digital markets have emerged to simplify transfers of credits, the process remains complex and often requires a team of lawyers, accountants and insurance firms to complete.

Uncertainty over the viability of projects and some unfinished tax credit rules have also given some buyers pause for thought. Crux, a market platform, expects $15bn-$20bn in transactions this year, up from $7bn-$9bn last year but still far below the market's almost $50bn in anticipated supply.",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,0.4039215686274509,453549919,1,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fc5153918-c79c-4257-9f9d-b8b663a6a67f.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9563520

The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub was up 0.34 euro at 30.33 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) by 0807 GMT, while the July contract was up 0.24 euro at 30.00 euro/MWh according to LSEG data.

In the British market, the day-ahead contract rose by 0.55 pence to 72.00 pence/therm.

""The market seems to have decided not to choose a direction for the moment, torn between comfortable spot fundamentals and several risk factors,"" analysts at Engie EnergyScan said.

""In particular, after recent Russian strikes caused significant damage to Ukrainian energy infrastructure... we can understand that the market is a little worried,"" they said.

Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have intensified since March, causing significant damage and blackouts in many regions.

Concerns over possible disruptions to gas supply also increased after Ukraine warned of a Russian force buildup in the north near its Sumy region in the vicinity of the Russian town of Sudzha from where Russian natural gas transits into Ukraine by pipe on its way to European customers.

Flows, however, have remained stable. Russia's Gazprom said that it would send 42.4 million cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Thursday, a volume broadly in line with recent days.

High gas stocks are also helping keep prices muted. ""EU gas stocks look healthy at two-thirds full. At the current injection rate, it would reach the mandated levels of at least 90% long before the November deadline,"" analysts at Auxilione said.

Europe's gas stores are currently 65.8 full according to latest Gas Infrastructure Europe data.

A panel session during this year's Invest in African Energy (IAE) 2024 forum explored strategies to unlock financing for renewable energy projects across the continent.

Taking place in Paris on May 14, the session, which included independent power producer ENGIE Energy Access, featured a robust discussion around solar energy deployment. Committed to raising electrification rates across the continent, the company is developing a $60 million mini-grid project in Nigeria, which is set for completion by 2026 and is poised to connect over 150,000 people to the grid.

""More than 600 million people lack access to electricity, and ENGIE Access' goal is to bridge this gap,"" stated ENGIE Energy Access Head of Funding Marie Testard, adding, ""ENGIE Energy Access is the energy access company that aims to deploy this solution in sub-Saharan Africa, and so far, we have a presence in nine countries, building almost 10 GW of mini-grids."" Meanwhile, having secured $222.5 million in commitments from African institutional investors in January, pan-African infrastructure investment platform Africa50 Group is well positioned to deploy a pipeline of renewable energy infrastructure projects.

The fund is poised to play a vital role in addressing the continent's energy needs while promoting inclusive and sustainable development.

Installed last year, the platforms -- which have just received their first turbine -- are part of a joint venture between Iberdrola, the Madrid-listed energy giant, and Masdar, the UAE's clean energy company. The 476-megawatt project should be capable of supplying up to 475,000 homes, marking one small step towards Europe's clean energy goals.

Yet, as wind turbines and solar farms are rolled out at pace, policymakers and energy experts are also focusing on another piece of the puzzle: working out how to fill the energy gap during periods of low wind and little sunlight -- or Dunkelflaute, as they are known in energy circles, using the German term.

Analysis by the International Energy Agency shows that roughly five or six times over the past 30 years, cold spells with little wind have affected large parts of Europe for a week or more, including areas where most onshore and offshore wind projects are located. The analysis covered the EU, UK, Nordic countries, several Balkan countries and Ukraine.

""We recognise that climates are changing, so how often these will occur is a bit hard to know,"" says Brent Wanner, head of the power sector unit at the IEA, which advises member nations on energy security. ""But being ready for these kinds of periods should be part of the planning.""

Europe's electricity system is set to change profoundly over the coming decades. Modelling by the think-tank Agora Energiewende suggests that, under national targets, 96 per cent of Europe's electricity will come from renewable sources, mostly wind and solar, by 2050. That compares with around 44 per cent now.

The continent will also become more reliant on electricity as households switch from petrol to electric cars and from gas-fired boilers to electric heat pumps. Electricity could meet up to 70 per cent of Europe's final energy demand by 2050, the modelling shows, compared with just over 20 per cent now.

Managing periods of low wind and sun without resorting to unabated fossil fuels is likely to require, among other things, a step change in electricity storage, so that it can be banked when the wind and sun are strong and deployed when they are not. Wind and solar farms in Europe and the UK are currently frequently asked to switch off if they are producing more than the grid can take.

Pumped storage hydropower -- where water is pumped up to a reservoir and then discharged when needed to drive a turbine -- is considered by the IEA to be the ""most efficient and cost-effective"" way available currently of storing energy over long periods of time.

Yet the technology is limited by geography and vulnerable to drought. One option policymakers are looking at is hydrogen as a form of storage: using electrolysis to split hydrogen from water when the wind and sun are strong, storing the hydrogen, and turning it back into electricity when the wind drops by using it to fuel a power station.

However, this process is highly inefficient, with potentially 70 per cent of the electricity lost along the way. In addition, low carbon hydrogen is likely to be in stronger demand from industries with few other ways to cut their emissions, such as fertiliser manufacture or steelmaking.

""Once the hydrogen is made, it's a very valuable molecule to have made, and can be used to decarbonise the most difficult to decarbonise areas first,"" explains Caroline Still, project leader at Aurora Energy Research in the UK.

Hydrogen can also be made by splitting it from natural gas, and there is growing interest in deposits of hydrogen underground. But the natural gas process releases carbon dioxide that needs to be captured and stored if it is not to contribute to climate change, while the extent of geological deposits is not yet clear.

These constraints mean hydrogen's role in power generation may end up being limited. Aurora forecasts that, overall, electricity generated by hydrogen will account for about 3 per cent of European power generation in 2050, in a scenario where the region meets its target to cut carbon emissions to net zero.

In a boost to the market, in February, the German government announced plans to subsidise power plant owners to develop up to 10GW of power stations able to run on hydrogen. ""We need [ . . .] modern and highly flexible climate-friendly power stations,"" the government said in a statement.

And, at the end of April, the European Commission awarded nearly €720mn to seven projects aiming to produce ""green hydrogen"" -- the type made through renewably powered electrolysis -- helping to develop the industry.

There have also been setbacks, though. Earlier this year, Engie, the French state-backed utility, pushed back its target to develop 4GW of hydrogen projects from 2030 to 2035.

It argued that the ""development and structuring [of the market] is slower than what was envisaged a year ago"".

James Forrest, global industry leader for energy transition and utilities at consultancy Capgemini, notes that enthusiasm for developing low carbon hydrogen has ""faded a bit"" over the past year -- in part due to high costs. ""It's too expensive and uncompetitive,"" he says.

Matthias Buck, Europe director at Agora Energiewende, believes that, given its challenges, hydrogen will face competition from other storage technologies, with several companies working on developing batteries so they can run for longer periods of time, and new ways to store heat.

""There's a very clear interest in developing new long-term storage solutions for power which are cheaper than the hydrogen route,"" he says. ""I am confident that, by the time we reach 2040-2045, we will have new things on the market that we don't yet see.""

He argues that the growing number of electricity cables allowing countries to export and import power will also help the system to cope. ""It's likely that, if you have a Dunkelflaute over the North Sea, you would have plentiful renewable production in other areas,"" he says.

But he notes that, while there is ""no need to fear Dunkelflaute"", provided the continent's power system is set up appropriately, this will not happen by itself.

""The question is: do we have the right things on the policy and administrative level to get there?"" he asks. ""I would say at European level the homework is mostly done. It's about making it concrete, in the regional context.""",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,0.3647058823529412,453528112,1,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F55548e47-ba53-4432-ba58-2070b53c9870.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9561767

In north-west Europe, slightly lower temperatures over the weekend and next week could help raise demand. German wind output is also forecast to start falling later this week, which typically lifts demand for gas from power plants, LSEG data showed.

British prices have risen, possibly tracking gains in TTF prices and in response to a new scheduled outage in Norway at the Karsto gas processing plant on May 22, said LSEG gas analyst Yuriy Onyshkiv.

News that Russia's military had stationed small assault units near Ukraine's northern Sumy region, which is close to the Sudzha area where Russian gas transits to Europe via Ukraine,lent some support to TTF prices yesterday.

""This incentive will fast-track the development of a green iron industry in Australia,"" iron ore billionaire and Fortescue Metals chief executive Andrew Forrest said in a statement on Tuesday.

""[It will bring] massive employment opportunities back to our country, value adding right here in Australia and slashing steel production's debilitating global emissions.

""Fortescue believes that commercial production of green iron in Australia is now possible and must be pursued.""

And Twiggy is not alone in his enthusiasm.

""Green iron... is the $100 billion a year export value uplift opportunity for Australia,"" Tim Buckley, the executive director Climate energy Finance told Renew Economy on Wednesday.

""That's the number one opportunity for Australia in the zero emissions industry of the future world,"" he adds.

""For the next decade there is no green hydrogen ship.""

Buckley concedes that in the context of $100 billion a year of exported embodied decarbonisation, what the federal government has set aside in this year's federal budget is ""a drop in the ocean compared to the investments required,"" but he says the main aim is to de-risk the market enough to mobilise private capital.

""Certainly, $6.7 billion of hydrogen production tax credits means it will be commercially viable a lot sooner than [developers] were previously thinking,"" he says.

The federal government's Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive (HTPI) will pay developers $A2 (US$1.32) per kilo of green hydrogen produced over a ten-year period, starting from 2027.

This might seem like small change in comparison with the sort of money the US government is splashing about through its IRA. Just this week the US Department of Energy awarded Nasdaq-listed electrolyser outfit Plug Power a $US1.66 billion conditional loan to finance the development and construction of up to six green hydrogen production facilities.

But for Fortescue, the Australian production subsidy will be a welcome boost to its efforts to green up its core business, particularly as its competitors move to do the same - like Korea steel maker Posco, which is partnering with Engie on a green steel project in Western Australia's Pilbara region.

Fortescue is trialing its in-house green iron technology at its major Chichester operations, also in the Pilbara in Western Australia - one of the largest iron ore producers in the world.

Forrest says Fortescue looks forward to working with government to ""imminently scale up"" the technology installed at the Christmas Creek Green Iron Plant, which it took a final investment decision on last November.

""This is a historic moment that, if introduced quickly, will spur the establishment of new green industries... creating tens of thousands of new jobs for Australians directly, hundreds of thousands of new jobs indirectly right across Australia, whilst cutting our emissions,"" said Forrest.

""Through the $2 per kilo tax credit for green hydrogen production, the government has seized this opportunity for the Australian people.""

The Frankfurt-listed company, spun out of German industrial group Thyssenkrupp last year, said that potential customers in Europe and North America were holding off on projects while they wait for governments to finalise financial support.

""The situation is causing a level of uncertainty in the market and is therefore dampening investment momentum,"" said Christoph Noeres, head of green hydrogen at the group. ""Obstacles to investment such as the design of regulatory requirements and the pace of funding commitments should be removed quickly,"" he added.

The EU, the US and the UK are among those backing the development of green hydrogen, which has been championed as a fuel for energy-intensive industries, transport and power stations.

Green hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced by splitting it from water using electricity generated from renewable sources. Thyssenkrupp Nucera manufactures the electrolyser systems used in the process.

Orders for the equipment fell 26 per cent in six months to the end of March to €120.8mn. The company slumped to a net loss of €4.4mn in the period, compared with €12.1mn profit in the same period last year.

Arno Pfannschmidt, chief financial officer, said he remained confident in the green hydrogen market and expected orders to pick up.

Nevertheless, the group's shares were down 7 per cent on Wednesday, leaving them down almost 50 per cent since the group listed.

Thyssenkrupp Nucera's caution echoes that of Engie, the French state-backed utility and Spanish energy group Iberdrola. In March, Engie pushed back its targets for installed electrolyser capacity by five years to 2035.

In the same month, Iberdrola cut its goal for the amount of green hydrogen it would produce by 2030 by roughly two-thirds.

José Sainz Armada, chief financial officer, told investors that the company would ""love to do more projects"" but is ""waiting for the funds to come through for the projects we have presented"".

The European Commission has set a target of producing 10mn tonnes of green hydrogen within the EU by 2030 and to import another 10mn tonnes, while the US is heavily subsidising the technology.

Thyssenkrupp Nucera's customers include the vast Neom project in Saudi Arabia, which is being developed by companies including Acwa Power to produce 600 tonnes of green hydrogen a day when it starts up in 2026.",ft.com,news,Financial Times News,,-0.003921568627450966,453472101,6,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F86205620-db73-499c-a45b-68a605a06354.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east,eng-9561767

Another stumble for offshore wind in New York has highlighted shifting sentiment in the offshore wind turbine market.

Last month, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) chose not to sign offtake agreements with three planned offshore wind projects after designated turbine supplier GE Vernova decided to switch to a smaller turbine.

The 1.4 GW Attentive Energy One (TotalEnergies and Corio Generation), 1.3 GW Community Offshore Wind (RWE and National Grid) and 1.3 GW Excelsior Wind (Vineyard Offshore) projects were all awarded provisional contracts in a competitive auction in October 2023.

GE Vernova decided to switch from its latest 18 MW turbines to a 15.5/16.5 MW platform and this caused ""technical and commercial complexities"" which meant the project could not proceed under the awarded contract terms, a NYSERDA spokesperson said. Most U.S. offshore wind projects set to be built over the next few years plan to install turbines in the 11 to 15 MW range.

The developers declined to comment on their plans for the projects but they have indicated their continued interest in the New York market, NYSERDA said. Last month, New York announced plans for two more offshore wind solicitations this summer and in 2025.

After years of rapid increases in turbine capacities, GE Vernova's decision reflects a trend by Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of introducing fewer new turbines and focusing on existing models for longer.

GE Vernova did not give a reason for its turbine switch, but it follows a difficult few years in which volatile costs and delivery challenges have delayed projects and severely dented the revenues of turbine suppliers.

The hunger for larger turbines led to some developers bidding projects based on turbines in early development stages, which can lead to offtake awards that are at higher risk of abandonment by awardees, a spokesperson for Danish turbine supplier Vestas told Reuters Events.

Vestas plans to focus on its 15 MW offshore wind turbine. This size is ""best positioned to enable greater certainty of on-time, successful project delivery,"" the spokesperson said.

Standardisation

Over the past decade, offshore wind developers in Europe and U.S. sought larger turbines to lower the cost of energy per kilowatt hour and win state-backed power contracts in competitive auctions.

The maximum size of new offshore wind turbines has risen from around 8 MW to around 15 MW amid an ""arms race"" among leading OEMs, said Signe Sorensen, Senior Research Analyst for the Americas at Aegir Insights.

Intense competition squeezed the margins of turbine suppliers, while volatile global costs and logistics issues since the coronavirus pandemic have prompted offshore wind investors, developers and suppliers to reassess project risks.

On the U.S. East Coast, soaring costs and high interest rates prompted multiple cancellation of offshore wind contracts, delaying projects and curbing progress in building out new supply chain facilities.

Under financial pressure, Western wind turbine suppliers are producing less turbine variants than Chinese rivals.

Since 2020, Western suppliers have announced 29 new variants of onshore and offshore wind turbines, compared with over 426 from China, according to Endri Lico, principal analyst for Global Wind Technology and Supply Chain at Wood Mackenzie.

""The main reason is due to OEMs profitability pressure and their need to simplify their product portfolio,"" Lico told Reuters Events.

Focusing on one model size could lead to reduced manufacturing costs thanks to standardization and industrialization, hence providing Western OEMs and their component suppliers with the ""clearest path to return to profitability,"" Lico said.

A focus on more mature existing technology would enable the supply chain to ""reap the quality and cost benefit of consistent volume and an industrialized wind turbine technology over many years,"" the Vestas spokesperson said.

""Designing technology with the current supply chain in mind will result in cost predictability, shorter execution times, and industry scalability,"" the spokesperson said.

Timing risk

Developers look to optimise power generation and in some cases smaller turbines can be more cost-competitive because they can produce more power at slower wind speeds, feature more mature technology, or are more readily available.

Developer Ocean Winds, a 50/50 joint venture owned by EDP Renewables and ENGIE, selects the best turbine size for a given project while also ""considering time to market,"" a company spokesperson said.

The pioneering 800 MW Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts (Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid) is currently installing an earlier turbine model by GE Vernova designed to operate at 14.7 MW. Meanwhile, the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will install 14.7 MW Siemens Gamesa turbines (SGRE) in the next few years while Orsted has chosen the 11 MW Siemens Gamesa models for the 924 MW Sunrise Wind project in New York.

Vestas has received firm orders for 15 MW turbines from projects in Poland, Germany and the Netherlands and has signed conditional agreements to supply the turbine to Equinor's Empire 1 and 2 projects in New York, the company said. Empire Wind 1 is slated to start producing power in 2026 but Empire Wind 2 has yet to secure an offtake agreement.

The standardisation of turbines at existing capacities would reduce the need for new larger vessels or significant upgrades to existing vessels.

A lack of U.S. wind turbine installation vessels remains a significant risk for project developers, exposing companies to global vessel supply markets and workarounds using barges to transport into and out of East Coast ports.

""The cost savings from the larger turbines are partially lost to increased vessel costs,"" Sorensen noted.

Bidding year

A raft of U.S. offshore wind auctions this year will indicate whether developers will be happy to focus on 15 MW turbines in their mid-term growth plans.

Developers including Orsted, Avangrid, Vineyard Offshore, EDP and Engie bid to secure up to 6 GW of new offshore wind capacity in the latest power auctions by three New England states. Together, the East Coast states of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maryland plan to tender for around 16 GW of offshore wind power in 2024.

Lico expects GE Vernova, Vestas and Siemens Gamesa to focus on the 14 to 15 MW range until 2029-2030, when they could start launching bigger models.

""They will continue to co-exist with the next-generation turbine for some years (beginning of '30s) until we fully transition to 20 MW [plus],"" he said.

Developers will continue to be tempted by larger turbines and lower costs, and ongoing innovations by Chinese suppliers could spur Western suppliers to refocus towards larger units.

Indeed, Siemens Gamesa has announced plans to develop ""the world's largest offshore turbine generator"" and has received funding from the European Union for a prototype model.

""If the competitors keep going bigger, GE Vernova and Vestas may have to as well, no matter their preferences,"" Sorensen said.",reutersevents.com,news,reutersevents.com,,0.3254901960784313,453471566,6,https://d2921o69vu3u9x.cloudfront.net/rtr34s8z_reuters_fabian_bimmer_0.jpg?0vx.FbTC0xEeYjRBMLxoQXwbMvDy9qVm,eng-9569264

Construction started on the solar and storage park - located on 60 hectares of municipal land in Vert - in June 2023. It will be connected to the Enedis electricity distribution network at the start of 2025 and power Orange's network.

The installation will couple a 77 MWp photovoltaic plant with a lithium-ion battery storage system with a capacity of 14.8MW/33.5MWh.

""Orange France is continuing its renewable energy supply strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of its activities,"" said Jean-François Fallacher, deputy managing director of Orange and CEO of Orange France. ""This type of PPA guarantees us competitive renewable energy and also allows, thanks to batteries, to store it when there is a surplus in order to avoid losses. We are proud to sign this contract with ZE Energy, a young French company, independent producer of renewable energy, and pioneer in the development of new hybrid production models.""

Founded in 2019, ZE Energy currently has four projects in operations around France totaling 26MW of solar capacity and 25.75MW of storage capacity.

Mathieu Lassagne, president of ZE Energy, added: ""We are very happy with the signing of this CPPA with Orange France. This format of the future, promising green electricity, at a stable, competitive price over a long period, opens the way to a much more virtuous economy in terms of energy consumption. ZE Energy's hybrid power plants, aimed at flexible production of solar energy, marketed in short circuits, fully participate in this.""

Orange aims to be net zero carbon by 2040. The telco has previously signed two solar PPAs in France with Total and Engie totaling more than 130MW, three PPAs in Poland, and two PPAs in Romania with Enery and Engie.

The telco is also installing solar panels at network sites and data centers. The company has deployed solar panels at two data centers in Poland in Łódź and Warsaw; and at its Bercenay-en-Othe teleport in France.

In Romania, the company is deploying panels in 300 network sites and four communication interconnection centers and data centers. As of August 2023, 650 solar panels had been installed on three interconnection centers in Constanța, Brașov, and Timişoara, as well as 133 network sites. In Africa, Orange is utilizing solar at data centers in the Ivory Coast - in Yamoussoukro and Grand Bassam - and Burkina Faso in Ouagadougou.

2022 also saw Orange launch a €50 million ($56.3m) carbon fund to finance reforestation and ecological restoration projects.

The solar panels, often mounted on rooftops or ground-mounted structures, capture sunlight and convert it into direct current (DC) electricity. Solar panels are made up of multiple photovoltaic (PV) cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight.

The off-grid solar system prices have decreased significantly over time because of technology advancements and economies of scale. These systems provide a more affordable option than building out network infrastructure in remote locations, which may be quite expensive.

Off-grid solar power makes decentralised electricity generation more economical since it does not require significant transmission and distribution networks.

Off-grid solar system prices have decreased significantly due to developments in power electronics, batteries, and solar panel technology.

Better energy storage and power management for off-grid systems are now possible due to advancements in battery technology in terms of cost, durability, and storage capacity.

Cost-effective power electronics like inverters have improved, allowing for a greater conversion of solar energy into useful electricity.

Off-grid solar systems are becoming more affordable owing to technology advancements and economies of scale, which make them a viable option for decentralised energy production.

Off-grid solar systems usually use batteries to save energy for use when sunlight is no longer available, such as at night or during cloudy weather.

Modern battery technologies have certain limitations that can affect the availability of electricity in off-grid solar systems. These barriers in energy storage capability and lifespan can result in conditions where off-grid solar structures cannot provide sufficient electrical energy during extended periods of inclement weather, such as during prolonged durations of rain or heavy cloud cover.

High strength demand for the duration of certain times may exceed the capacity of the batteries, leading to limitations in accessing electricity.

The off-grid solar allows for decentralized energy generation, reducing dependence on centralized power plants and transmission lines. This decentralized approach enhances energy resilience and reduces the risk of power outages, especially in areas prone to natural disasters or with unreliable grid infrastructure.

Impact of COVID-19

COVID-19 impacted almost all industries as lockdown measures and social distancing guidelines made it difficult for off-grid solar companies to conduct installations, repairs, and maintenance. This posed challenges in deploying new systems or providing timely support and services to existing customers.

The off-grid solar industry heavily relies on global supply chains for components such as solar panels, batteries, and inverters. The pandemic disrupted these supply chains, causing delays and shortages, which affected the availability and affordability of off-grid solar systems. The economic impact of the pandemic led to financial constraints for individuals and businesses, affecting their ability to invest in off-grid solar systems.

The tips and predictions for AFL Round 10,"Round 10 of the 2024 AFL season is upon us and several sides are facing banana peel games.

While we only have one pre-round top-eight matchup with Sydney and Carlton facing off on Friday night, we could be looking at plenty of upsets taking place.

We kick off in Darwin where the Suns host the Cats, before we head to the SCG for the Friday blockbuster. Saturday hosts four intriguing games before Sunday returns to its normal format with a 3:20 pm (AEST) fixture for the first time in weeks.

With all of that in mind, see our tips and predictions for Round 10 below.

Prime time footy heads to Darwin on Thursday night and both the Gold Coast Suns and Geelong are looking to make a statement.

After playing at TIO Stadium last week, Damien Harwick's Suns have remained in Darwin and have flown in extra troops to battle the difficult conditions.

Although, they are conditions Gold Coast handled with aplomb when earning its biggest win of the year against North Melbourne last weekend. Hardwick's men have won their last five games in the Top End and have proven time and time again that the slippery conditions prove no hindrance.

Compare that with the Cats, who have never played for premiership points in Darwin, and a clear gap begins to emerge.

Add in the facts that Geelong will rest Tom Hawkins and Jeremy Cameron is concussed, and the Cats are facing a significant uphill battle.

Since Cameron's first season at the Cattery in 2021, Chris Scott has had at least one of the former Giant and Hawkins play each week. Round 10, 2024 presents the first time both will miss.

Whoever the Cats call in reinforcement will have to deal with a dynamic Suns backline, given Sam Collins and Mac Andrew are both in the top three for average intercepts in the competition, while teammate Sam Flanders picked up 10 of his own last week.

Geelong's midfield was also belted last week - especially early on - against Port Adelaide and is vulnerable to the powerful combination that is Touk Miller, Matt Rowell and Noah Anderson.

Yet Scott is long odds to be beaten by what he knows is his side's weakness twice in a row and the Cats held up brilliantly in the wet against Brisbane in Round 6. They'll be right in the contest.

Carlton and Sydney will meet on Friday night in a rematch of last year's Elimination Final.

Can the Blues head to the SCG and stop the rampaging Swans or will the current number one seed continue their strong season?

Sydney is currently the number one team in the competition at scoring from turnover, something that will trouble a Carlton side that has struggled to move the ball out of their backline in the last fortnight.

In the Elimination Final last year it was Errol Gulden, Nick Blakey, Jake Lloyd and Chad Warner who cut the Blues open and nearly swung the game in the second half. Can Carlton's half forwards and wingmen quell their influence?

The Swans will be without Tom McCartin once again and given he won the battle with Charlie Curnow last year, that is a big loss.

On the Carlton side, they lose Adam Cerra, Matt Cottrell and Marc Pittonet as their injury list once again swells into the double digits.

Carlton has faired well in recent years against the Swans, having won four of their last six matchups and in part it has been thanks to the Blues' big-bodied midfielders getting on top at the centre bounce.

Matt Kennedy successfully tagged Christian Petracca early in Round 9, forcing the Melbourne star to move forward. Will Kennedy now get the job on Isaac Heeney?

This feels like a straight up 50-50 game. If Pittonet doesn't play, it will be an enormous night for Tom De Koning given Carlton will need to win this game in the middle.

Can Collingwood keep the ball rolling or will injuries finally catch up to them?

Those are the big questions facing the home side in this game as they look to keep their six-game unbeaten streak alive.

While they may regain a Jordan De Goey or Tom Mitchell for the clash, their casualty ward grew even bigger after their win against the Eagles with all of Jeremy Howe, Harvey Harrison and Jack Bytel going down.

If they keep getting the performances that Nick Daicos is putting in though, they'll keep winning, he's been that good across the last handful of games as a clearance-winning, goal-kicking midfielder.

As for Adelaide, they haven't beaten Collingwood since 2016 but definitely won't fear the Magpies having only gone down to them by a goal or less in all of their last three attempts.

Their form is also quietly building having beaten Port Adelaide and North Melbourne in their last three weeks as well as drawing with Brisbane.

This will be a bigger test for them though, as they also haven't won at the MCG since 2017.

Their key to victory is their potent forward line kicking at least 85 points. Win here, and they're back in the hunt for finals.

For the Pies, they're deserved favourites and will win if they continue getting a good spread from their forward line.

With so many out though, can they keep backing their system over talent? We think so, but we're not as sold as we would be if they had a few more available.

Hostilities resume between the Giants and the Bulldogs in western Sydney on Saturday.

It's the first game back at Engie Stadium since Round 2 for the Giants and they'll be desperate to again step on their home turf where they've won five of their last six.

They enter this after a disappointing 20-point defeat to Essendon which just so happened to be a third defeat in four games. Are they in a little slump? Or is this about where they belong, just outside the top four?

The Doggies had a fill-up of colossal proportions against Richmond last week, kicking their biggest score of the season (133) to win by 91 points.

But beware a Bulldogs side in form. They're 0-6 after wins of 50 or more points.

From personnel point of view, the Giants lose Josh Kelly and Lachie Ash who have both succumbed to calf injuries. Kelly in particular is a massive loss. The Dogs only have one fresh injury concern with Laitham Vandermeer carrying a shin issue out of the Tigers win.

It sets up as a very tricky affair to assess, with the Giants down on form and the Dogs coming to town after a dominant performance.

But we cannot simply forget the Dogs losing to Hawthorn and Fremantle prior and after failing to back it up after hefty wins, the Giants should not be discounted.

They are rightful favourites and although the Dogs have won five of the last six clashes, we just want to see them beat a top eight team before we can trust them.

Toby Greene, who has been fairly quiet this season, loves playing the Doggies with bags of five, seven and four goals in the last three meetings. He is due to have an influence.

It will be a tough old battle but the Giants should get up at home.

One thing is for certain, this clash isn't going to be pretty.

Neither the Saints nor Dockers would be happy with their performance last week, collectively scoring 11.26 as they both fell in underwhelming fashion.

Having now lost four of their last five, St Kilda is desperate to end their slide, however it won't come easy against a side that is just as staunch defensively as the Saints are.

The Dockers concede the third-least points per game in the competition but haven't had much luck on the offensive side of the ball this season.

Fremantle has been improving that aspect as they become more free-flowing with their ball movement, yet Ross Lyon's lauded defensive structure could shut that down quickly.

With both clubs focused on controlling possession and limiting momentum, a low-scoring affair is all but guaranteed.

This will result in an increased reliance on the clearance and contested possession games, and with Fremantle and St Kilda having the on-paper advantage in each of those respective areas, it's shaping up to be a genuine 50/50.

The Dockers have had their fair share of trouble at Marvel in recent years, and while St Kilda hasn't exactly turned their home turf into a fortress, it's enough to give the Saints the edge.

Richmond visits the Gabba in the second of a Saturday night double header in what might be the Lions' best opportunity to kickstart their 2024 season.

Brisbane travelled to Adelaide last Sunday for what was potentially the most entertaining game for the season, battling out a 90-all draw with the Crows following a thrilling eight-goal final term.

They now sit on 14 points through nine rounds, with just three wins for the season and only one coming against a top eight side in Melbourne.

In their draw over the weekend, the Lions and Crows entered the game as the first and third best clearance teams in the AFL, and in what proved an intense clash at the centre of the park, the Lions lost out, finishing -19 in hit outs and -6 in clearances.

Despite this, they dominated around the ground, with +36 in total kicks, +42 in marks, +8 inside 50s and most importantly +22 in scores from stoppage. The Lions remain the number one clearance team in the competition.

Against a team like the Tigers, who rank dead last in clearances, the Lions are set to do significant damage from stoppage.

As for Richmond, there is not a whole lot of positive to take from their Saturday night clash with the Bulldogs.

-116 in disposals, -36 in inside 50's, -105 in uncontested possessions, -13 in marks inside 50 and -9 in tackles, it was an utter capitulation from Adem Yze's men.

While the Tigers were without Dylan Grimes and Liam Baker, the returns of Noah Balta, Dion Prestia and Jack Graham proved insignificant.

In terms of effort and intent, their clash with the Dogs was an abnormality. The Tigers still have a strong core group and have experienced moments of dominance in games all across 2024.

Yze's start has not been ideal, but there are certainly things that the Tigers can revert to from previous weeks that can aid them in sucking the most out of the season that they possibly can.

As for their clash against the Lions, play the kids, hope to go injury free and compete from start to finish.

The Bombers proved that they're a legit finals contender with last week's win over GWS and they should keep that momentum rolling here against North Melbourne.

The Roos are the only winless team remaining in 2024 and they haven't got within four goals of any of their opponents this campaign. That's how far they are off the pace.

Simply put, they won't be good enough against an Essendon team that's really finding their brand of footy.

The main question from this game could be, 'By how much?', given that Essendon's percentage is only 98.3 - the sixth worst in the competition despite them sitting third on the ladder.

Win here by a big margin and the Dons go 7-2-1 and begin getting comfortable in a top-four spot.

At least North fans will be able to vent their frustrations on former club stalwarts Brad Scott, Todd Goldstein and Ben McKay who now represent the Dons.

We get the feeling it'll be that trio who are smiling post-game, though.

Two teams entering the round after massive wins; the Hawks travel south to take on the Power at Adelaide Oval.

Port Adelaide entered Round 9 off the back of a disappointing 30-point defeat to the Crows in the Showdown. They were without their captain Connor Rozee, and they had failed to beat a true contender since their Round 22 clash with the Giants in 2023.

With all that being said, they travelled to the hardest fixture in the modern game, Geelong at Kardinia Park, and booted eight goals in the first quarter, followed by another four in the second to find themselves 41 points up at half time.

It was Port Adelaide's best performance in some time, defying the odds and claiming victory in phenomenal fashion.

The Power finished the game +53 in disposals, +9 in clearances and +23 in marks, controlling the tempo despite Geelong's nine goal second half. Ken Hinkley's men did enough to hold off the Cats.

They return home with six wins from nine, just out of the top four on percentage, and with this win under their belt, the confidence amongst the changeroom will be hitting record highs.

The Hawks have won three of their last four games, putting away the Bulldogs and the Saints in very strong back-to-back victories for Sam Mitchell's men.

Against the Saints, Hawthorn did not give up the lead at any point despite being -8 in inside 50s.

Without captain and All-Australian James Sicily, the Hawks' back half held firm, holding the Saints to just three goals in the final half despite the Saints running home with momentum.

While the Hawks are in some commendable form, it will be tough to overcome a confident Port Adelaide side.

A Sunday twilight clash with the West Coast Eagles presents as a banana peel game for Melbourne in a fly-in, fly-out mission for four points.

The last three games the Eagles played at Optus Stadium saw resounding victories against Richmond and Fremantle before pushing Essendon all the way and now Melbourne cross the nullabor in hope.

While not the easy beats they have been in the past two years, there's still a clear pathway to beating West Coast. Win contest and dominate territory, and the Eagles are no hope.

When winning against the Tigers and Dockers, Adam Simpson's men smashed both sides in inside 50s and contested footy. Contest and clearance against Essendon were relatively even in a six-point loss.

But against Collingwood on Sunday the Eagles were smashed to smithereens in all of territory, clearance and contest.

Plenty of that was done to Elliot Yeo's absence with a groin injury, and he's a test to return this weekend.

But Melbourne's profile isn't strong in territory and ranks 9th in contested footy differential. If Christian Petracca plays forward again, there's plenty to suggest the Eagles are in this clash up to their eyeballs.

But after squandering a good look last week, don't expect Melbourne to make the same mistake twice if the game is on the line late.

A win, and potentially a big one, is likely needed to keep the Demons in the top four beyond Round 10.",sen.com.au,news,SEN 1116,,0.09019607843137245,453458447,1,https://images.ctfassets.net/u8w3l566ay8a/6DDlUi4IWLHUylQruXSQMF/ee5c7e2eb61b9f93cb54b46d22217d31/EF1CaSy23MW3027.jpg?w=1200&h=630,eng-9571865

To facilitate this, the budget contained incentives for green iron metal projects and the processing of critical minerals such as lithium, a key component in electric vehicle car batteries.

Chalmers announced the government's $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package, declaring its task was to make Australia ""an indispensable part of the global economy"".

According to Chalmers, the package will achieve this aim by attracting investment in nascent industries such as green iron metal (and possibly green steel), and established areas such as aluminium and solar panels.

To back this up, the budget contains $13.7 billion in production tax incentives for green hydrogen (to be used in the processing of green iron metal) and for processing critical minerals.

According to the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC), there are 65 mining ventures across Australia ""currently looking at down-streaming or value-adding options as part of their projects"".

In addition, the budget includes $1.7 billion allocated to the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund for the development of new industries such as green metals and low carbon fuels.

Augmenting this investment will be about $1.1 billion allocated to deepen ""net-zero"" regional trade, and mapping ""the geological potential of our entire country"", Chalmers told parliament.

The rough equivalent of Jim Chalmers' package is the US Inflation Reduction (IRA) Act, a plethora of subsidies and tax incentives to encourage, once again, a net-zero makeover of the American economy. But the IRA's estimated cost over eight years is about $A1.6 trillion, compared with Chalmers' $22.7 billion.

Similar makeover schemes, although not on the same scale, are being introduced in the EU. Both have strong elements of protection, largely aimed at excluding a rush of green-friendly Chinese products such as EVs.

As the Financial Times has pointed out, US policymakers have blended industrial policy, trade policy, green energy and geopolitics into a potent nationalist formula.

And there's more. Just hours after Chalmers' delivered his budget speech, US President Joe Biden sharply increased tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, plus other products such as solar cells, into what the Financial Times described as a ""a pre-election effort to protect US jobs"".

The White House said the tariffs, including quadrupling the barrier on imported Chinese EVs from 25 to 100 per cent, were ""carefully targeted at strategic sectors"".

While the Australian task may be much smaller in scale, it's also more complex. It starts with green iron metal.

According to Rod Sims, a former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission head, a professor of public policy at the ANU and chairman of the non-profit Superpower Institute, ""the underlying economics"" for Australia to process iron ore into green iron metal ""are unarguable"". This is because green iron metal ""would see the value of our exports go up many times"".

To make green iron metal requires using hydrogen instead of metallurgical coal. But hydrogen ""is very difficult to export to make green iron metal"", providing a level of natural protection.

""You've got to have your low-cost renewables, which we have got. We've (also) got the magnetite iron ore (in South Australia)"" for processing into green iron metal, ""but the technology may not be far away to use the haematite ore (which is in the Pilbara region of WA).""

Meanwhile, the list of potential consortia to launch green iron metal, and possibly even green steel, projects is growing. It includes BHP, Rio and BlueScope Steel; South Korean steel producer Posco and giant French power utility ENGIE; and Andrew Forrest's Fortescue.

Forrest's involvement once again underlines the pivotal role China has in the government's Future Made in Australia story. Hailing from one of WA's most influential families, ""Twiggy"" Forrest experienced some rocky times early on in his corporate career.

Starting as a stockbroker, he became the founding CEO of Anaconda Nickel in 1993. However, in 2001 he was ousted as CEO when the company almost collapsed.

Forrest underwent a corporate transformation over the coming decade, mainly due to his anticipation of surging Chinese demand for iron ore and a shrewd calculation about the real value of once-discarded deposits in the Pilbara region.

He established a strong and profitable iron ore mining operation in the Pilbara's Chichester Range, and in 2008 Fortescue began exporting iron ore to China.

Fortescue's financial ties with the Chinese were close. As Andrew Lee points out in his book The Second Rush, Forrest was negotiating sales contracts with Chinese steel mills while arranging with Chinese engineering firms to build port and mine infrastructure.

He raised more than $2 billion in US financial markets, and secured further funds after negotiating long-term contracts with Chinese steel mills.

On budget eve, the Sydney Morning Herald's CBD column reported that Forrest had recruited former Victorian Labor premier Daniel Andrews to pursue sales contracts for green iron metal to Chinese steelmakers.

Andrews was premier at a time when it was the only government entity in Australia to negotiate with the Chinese government about becoming part of its global Belt and Road Infrastructure program. According to the CBD column, Andrews is taking on the project through his consultancy, Forty Eight and Partners.

For Forrest and others, the potential return from green iron metal export deals to China and elsewhere from the Pilbara is huge. Taking all Australia's iron exports into account, this move up the processing value chain could triple the return from current iron ore exports from $125 billion a year to about $375 billion.

According to Ralph Evans, a former head of Austrade and a one-time management consultant who first worked for CSR as a chemical engineer, the new package of subsidies and tax breaks ""may help, but they may not be enough"". Evans adds: ""you cannot permanently subsidise your way into competitiveness.""

Meanwhile, the ""Made in Australia"" push is proverbially competing for political oxygen with other priorities. ""Mr Albanese seems to be walking about with a Venn diagram in his head,"" Evans says.

John Venn, a British mathematician and philosopher, invented his diagram in the 1880s as a way to present and illustrate ideas. The Venn diagram contains three or more overlapping circles, that can be used to illustrate the way things overlap or are perhaps inconsistent with each other.

Writing in the Pearls and Irritations digital newsletter, Evans commented that ""the first circle in Albo's head is the national energy transition and emissions reduction agenda. A larger circle surrounds this, representing the low-carbon ""superpower"" idea promoted by Professor Ross Garnaut"" - a former adviser to the Hawke government and a one-time Australian ambassador to China.

""This would see Australia expand its clean energy output to give us a world-leading position in low-carbon products like 'green' steel or aluminium.

""Another circle overlaps the above, representing Albo's 'Made in Australia' agenda, which would see taxpayer money supporting new manufacturing in Australia, making products for the 'greener' world.

Yet another ""represents an agenda to mine and add value to 'critical' minerals in Australia"".

And there's another: the Albanese government's promise to spend more money to spur new local industries to ""restore faith"" with blue-collar Queenslanders who deserted the ALP in the 2019 federal election defeat.

Just days before the budget, Albanese acknowledged the Future Made in Australia Act, along with industrial relations changes, were also about honouring a compact with blue-collar workers, especially those in a large Queensland energy industry shifting away from coal to net-zero.

In 2019, Labor suffered huge swings against it in central Queensland and now holds just five of the 30 federal seats in a state where voters are heading to the polls in October.

So it's not just about jobs Made in Australia, or undergoing our biggest energy makeover since the late-70s mining investment boom.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.1686274509803922,453456377,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2349%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/ac2bc01e941c6f6315f1a0c55852290f2cdd1f01,eng-9571828

The measure is intended to hamper the logistics of Russian gas exports from the Arctic, which during the winter months requires the use of ice-breaking LNG carriers. These ships, which are scarce due to their high production, maintenance and operating costs, deliver the LNG they carry to European ports for subsequent transport by conventional LNG carriers to the Asian market, especially China.

The sanctions, therefore, do not reduce the volumes of natural gas supplied to the EU and should not have a significant impact on European benchmark prices. Yet it is a move that will reduce Russia's export revenues and paves the way for a ban on Russian LNG imports to the EU by 2027, in line with the targets set out in REPowerEU.

Why are transshipment services important?

From November to June, during the Arctic winter season, LNG that is exported from the Yamal project needs to use ice-breaking vessels to access international markets. The port where the Yamal LNG terminal is located, Sabetta, is inaccessible to conventional vessels during these months as it is surrounded by frozen waters. At present, there are only 15 icebreakers in operation, and they are mostly operated by Western shipping lines (OMV, Seapeak and Dynagas) that are well established, reputable and therefore compliant with international sanctions. To optimise the voyages of these specialised vessels, the natural gas they carry is transferred to conventional LNG tankers in warm water ports.

These transhipment services, essential for Russian LNG logistics, take place mainly in Zeebrugge, Belgium, and Montoir-de-Bretagne, France, in order to access the Asian market. In winter, permanent darkness and ice in the Arctic Ocean render it impossible for LNG tankers, even icebreakers, to reach Asian markets through the Bering Strait. This forces shipments to be re-routed through European ports servicing LNG from Yamal. Unlike crude oil transhipments, the technical specification of LNG transhipment operations means that they must be carried out in specialised ports.

As a result, Russian LNG exported to Asia during winter relies on EU port services specifically designed for these operations. Currently, Fluxys, the Belgian gas transport system operator, has a 20-year contract with Yamal LNG for gas transhipment at the Zeebrugge terminal, where a dedicated storage tank was built for Russian LNG operations in 2020. The Montoir-de-Bretagne terminal is also transhipping Yamal LNG through the ship-to-ship process under a 23-year contract signed by Engie that was subsequently inherited by France's TotalEnergies. Although these are lucrative contracts for these ports, their termination would have limited implications for the EU gas market. Novatek, the operator of the Yamal LNG facility, previously conducted transhipment operations outside port facilities in Norwegian fjords and continues to do so in Russian waters north of Murmansk. However, these ship-to-ship operations require calm seas and weather and do not offer the same security as European port terminals.

Why are these sanctions effective?

The fact that Yamal LNG continues to flow to Asia, China in particular, even when the Northern Arctic Route is closed for the winter, underlines the importance of contractual destination restrictions, which oblige LNG cargoes to be physically delivered to the agreed port. This explains why even now most LNG tankers avoid passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait: Russian cargoes from Yamal are making the longer and more costly journey via the Cape of Good Hope around Africa for deliveries to Asia.

Russia has built a floating terminal for such transshipments in Murmansk and Kamchatka, but US sanctions imposed on both projects in September 2023 appear to have delayed their entry into full operation. The US sanctions affect the companies operating the Murmansk floating terminal, which has prevented LNG tanker operators, mostly Western companies, from delivering or gathering LNG from the facility.

Banning transshipments in European ports will be especially disruptive for Russian LNG logistics and exports to Asia during next winter. This will be particularly relevant for Yamal LNG's contract with CNPC, whose final destination is bound to be China. Both companies will have to renegotiate the contract and, foreseeably, sell part of the LNG output during the winter months on the European market, probably with significant discounts. Other offtakers in the Yamal project, although not contractually obliged to do so, exported part of the gas to the Asian market (SEFE, Gunvor, TotalEnergies and Shell). During the winter months they will also have to redirect these volumes to the European market. It is an open question whether LNG tanker operators will be willing to take greater risks and logistical constraints by resorting to transhipments in Russian waters.

Figure 1. Long-term supply LNG Yamal contracts

In addition, Novatek is encountering problems in obtaining the services of new LNG carriers, both conventional and icebreakers, because of US sanctions. The latter have prevented the transfer of six icebreaking LNG carriers that were built at the Hanwha shipyard in South Korea. Novatek, together with Sovcomflot, had directly commissioned the construction of icebreaking LNG carriers from Russia's Zvezda shipyard in collaboration with Samsung, which subsequently abandoned the project. Sanctions are also reportedly delaying commissioning by preventing access to key Western technology. France's GTT and US-based General Electric, suppliers of some of the equipment for these LNG carriers, withdrew from Russia in 2023 because of the sanctions.

Sanctions on LNG transshipment and access to technology impose a very high cost on Russia without significantly harming EU interests. As recommended by the Agency of EU Energy Regulators, ACER, reductions in Russian LNG imports should be approached with caution, especially in light of the imminent expiry of the contract for Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine at the end of 2024. It seems more reasonable to focus efforts on limiting access to Western technology and transshipment services to Russian LNG companies, minimising the impact on the European natural gas market and maximising costs for Russian gas companies and Russian coffers.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,Elcano Royal Institute,0.0117647058823529,453427167,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/a-3-e1715730886278.jpg,eng-9562354

The weekly average price fell only in the French market, which registered the lowest value, thus breaking the Iberian market's streak of the lowest prices. Photovoltaic energy reached all?time records in Germany, Spain, France and Portugal. Wind energy production fell and gas and CO prices rose.

In the week of May 6, solar energy production increased in most European markets compared to the previous week. The French market registered the largest increase, 49%, reversing the downward trend of the previous two weeks. The Portuguese and Spanish markets registered increases of 35% and 16%, respectively. The German market had the smallest increase, 9.4%, maintaining an upward trend for the third consecutive week. The Italian market was the exception, with a drop in solar energy production of 2.1%.

During the second week of May, the Portuguese, Spanish, French and German markets broke historical records for daily solar photovoltaic energy production. The Portuguese market broke the production record on Sunday, May 12, with a total generation of nearly 20 GWh. Mainland Spain set the all?time record on Wednesday, May 8, with 181 GWh generated using photovoltaic energy. On the other hand, France set the record on Friday, May 10, with 128 GWh, while Germany set it on Sunday, May 12, with 382 GWh of generation using this technology. The Italian market registered the second highest value in its history, 132 GWh, after the maximum registered on Sunday, May 5, which was 134 GWh.

For the third week of May, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's solar energy production forecasts, it will continue to increase in Germany. However, in Spain and Italy, solar energy production will decrease.

In the second week of May, wind energy production decreased in all analyzed European markets compared to the previous week. The German market experienced the largest decrease, 64%, followed by the Portuguese, Spanish and Italian markets, with decreases of 50%, 34% and 27%, respectively. The French market continued to register declines for the third consecutive week, this time by 9.0%.

In the week of May 13, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's wind energy production forecasts, it will increase in the German, Spanish and Portuguese markets. On the other hand, in the French and Italian markets, wind energy production will continue to decline.

During the week of May 6, electricity demand declined in most major European electricity markets compared to the previous week. The French market registered the largest decline, which was 8.9%, followed by declines in the Netherlands and Great Britain, 7.6% in both markets. These three markets continued the downward trend for the second consecutive week. On the other hand, the Portuguese and Belgian markets had declines of 2.0% in both cases. In the Belgian market, it is the third consecutive week with this trend. Most of the declines in demand are related to the celebration of the Ascension Day on May 9 in Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. The United Kingdom celebrated the Early May bank holiday on Monday, May 6.

On the other hand, the markets of Italy, Spain and Germany registered increases in demand of 6.8%, 1.7% and 0.1%, respectively. The increases in demand in the markets of Italy, Spain and Germany during the second week of May were mainly related to the recovery in demand after the May 1 holiday, International Workers' Day.

On the other hand, the less cold average temperatures registered in a large part of the markets favored the decrease in demand. In Italy, France, Spain, Great Britain and Portugal average temperatures increased between 1.6 °C and 3.8 °C. In Belgium the increase was smaller, 0.9 °C. The Netherlands and Germany were the exception, where average temperatures decreased by 0.3 °C and 2.1 °C, respectively.

For the week of May 13, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's demand forecasts, it will increase in the markets of Germany, Belgium, France, Portugal and Italy. On the other hand, in the markets of the Netherlands, Spain and Great Britain demand will decrease.

Most markets reached the highest prices of the week on Monday, May 6, and then fell back over the course of the week, leaving most days at prices similar to those of previous weeks. The exception to the weekly price rises was the EPEX SPOT market of France, with a 17% drop. The Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries and the EPEX SPOT market of Germany achieved the largest percentage price increases, 12% and 18%, respectively. In contrast, the N2EX market of the United Kingdom registered the smallest percentage increase, 1.4%. In the other markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices rose between 2.1% in the EPEX SPOT market of the Netherlands and 11% in the MIBEL market of Portugal.

In the second week of May, despite the price increases, weekly averages remained below €65/MWh in most analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the German market, the British market and the IPEX market of Italy, with averages of €67.33/MWh, €81.65/MWh and €90.86/MWh, respectively. On the other hand, the French market registered the lowest weekly average, €28.06/MWh, thus breaking the streak that the MIBEL market had been on by reaching the lowest prices for thirteen consecutive weeks. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €30.81/MWh in the Spanish market to €62.81/MWh in the Dutch market.

Regarding hourly prices, most analyzed European markets registered negative prices on May 11 and 12. The exceptions were the British and Italian markets, where there were no negative prices, and the Portuguese market, which only registered negative prices on the 11. On the other hand, the Nordic market also reached negative prices on Thursday, May 9. The rest of the analyzed markets, in addition to these three days, registered negative hourly prices on Monday, May 13. The Dutch market reached the lowest hourly price again, ?€200.00/MWh, on Sunday, May 12, from 13:00 to 14:00.

During the week of May 6, the fall in wind energy production and the increase in the average price of gas and CO emission allowances had an upward influence on European electricity market prices. In addition, electricity demand increased in the German, Spanish and Italian markets. The previous week's public holiday on May 1 led to a decrease in demand and prices on that day in almost all markets. The Italian market also registered a decrease in solar energy production.

AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's price forecasts indicate that prices of the analyzed European electricity markets might fall in the third week of May, influenced by the increase in wind energy production in most markets.

After the price drop in the first week of May, the settlement prices of Brent oil futures for the Front?Month in the ICE market remained below $85/bbl during the second week of May. On Thursday, May 9, these futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, $83.88/bbl. This price was 0.3% higher than the previous Thursday. On the other hand, on Friday, May 10, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, $82.79/bbl. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 0.2% lower than the previous Friday and the lowest since March 13.

In the second week of May, concerns about global economic evolution counterbalanced the upward influence caused by instability in the Middle East and the possibility that OPEC+ will maintain its production cuts in the second half of 2024. As a result, Brent oil futures prices remained stable.

As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front?Month, on Monday, May 6, they reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €32.14/MWh. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 15% higher than the previous Monday and the highest since April 19. Subsequently, settlement prices declined, but they remained above €30/MWh. On Friday, May 10, these futures reached their weekly minimum settlement price, €30.03/MWh. This price was 1.6% lower than the previous Friday.

In the second week of May, concerns about supply to refill reserves for the coming winter drove TTF gas futures prices higher. LNG supply decreased in April due to higher prices in Asian markets. In addition, next winter might be colder than normal. However, still high European reserve levels continued to limit price increases.

As for CO emission allowances futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2024, settlement prices remained above €70/t during the second week of May. On Tuesday, May 7, these futures reached their weekly minimum settlement price, €70.98/t. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was still 3.6% higher than the previous Tuesday. In contrast, on Thursday, May 9, these futures registered their weekly maximum settlement price, €73.26/t. This price was 1.0% higher than the previous Thursday and the highest since April 17. In the last session of the second week of May, the settlement price was €71.90/t.

But there's another fascinating founder doing double-duty (actually triple-duty) who isn't a household name yet. Meet Jyoti Bansal.

Bansal sold AppDynamics to Cisco in 2017 for $3.7 billion. It was a wild deal, given that the transaction occurred the day before AppDynamics was slated to go public on the Nasdaq. Since then, Bansal's story has become more incredible.

After exiting AppDynamics, he started another software delivery platform called Harness, serving as its CEO. He then cofounded and became CEO of Traceable AI. And then, for good measure, he cofounded a VC firm called Unusual Ventures.

Harness, last valued at $3.7 billion, has just reached a new milestone: The startup raised $150 million in debt financing from First Citizens-owned Silicon Valley Bank and Hercules Capital, Fortune has exclusively learned. The company will focus on expanding its generative AI and go-to-market capabilities, and launching new product lines.

The debt raise is an interesting choice. Harness to date has raised more than $425 million from investors like Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, and IVP. But debt made the most logical sense at this juncture, Bansal told Fortune. Right now, he said, the cost of capital from equity investors can be as high as 40%, while debt is closer to between 15% and 20% for late stage companies.

""I don't mind investors, but it's a question of what the lowest cost of capital is for us,"" said Bansal. ""Capital is a means to an end. A lot of founders, especially in tech, treat fundraising like it's the goal... Sometimes I'll look at a resume, and I'll see 'I raised $20 million, I raised $50 million' like it's an accomplishment. But what did you do with the $20 million?""

It's a fair question. But that's not the question I wanted to talk to Bansal about.

What makes someone want to keep founding startups, and in some cases, even run multiple startups at once? That's the question the profile about Bansal that I published today is looking to answer.

Bansal's story caught me off-guard, and I really owe the idea to Thomvest Ventures managing director Umesh Padval, a Harness investor. About six weeks ago, Padval and I were on a Zoom call getting to know one another and I told him I really wanted to try my hand at more profiles. I mentioned an idle interest in Bansal.

Padval stopped me right there, with vehemence: ""You should absolutely do that, go do that right now,"" he said. (I tell people my fleeting half-ideas all the time, but it's pretty rare that someone feels so strongly about one of them, that they find a way to look me in the eyes through a Zoom.)

Harness represents unfinished business for Bansal, Padval told me.

""He had this desire to build AppDynamics to be a billion-dollar ARR company, and he never got to do it because he sold early,"" said Padval. ""So, he has this unfinished dream to build Harness into a billion-dollar ARR company.""

Padval also likened Bansal to a tech CEO who may run only one company, but it's an incredibly successful one: Nvidia's Jensen Huang, whose graphics chip company is now worth an astounding $2.3 trillion. No matter how many unicorns you build, that's a big number.

I warned him there would be readers who think that comparison is crazy.

""Look, he's young, the companies are young, so it takes time,"" said Padval. ""But every ten years, someone comes along and, to me, he really is the guy... He's an execution machine like Jensen. He's willing to make changes when it's meaningful. At Harness, from 1 million to 50 million he had sales and marketing people, and when he reached 50, he changed the whole thing again, even though they were great people. He has the guts to do it.""

So, Padval's conviction sent me in the direction of today's story about Bansal, Harness, Traceable, AppDynamics, and venture. It's a story about dreams realized and just-missed, about how real ambition ultimately requires humility -- and about the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi.

Jean-Luc Flémal - BELPRESS/MAXPPP

The National Energy Ombudsman (MNE) singled out four energy suppliers in its annual report. This is due to the tendency to ""underestimate, in certain cases, sometimes deliberately, the amount of their clients' monthly payments"".

Engie, ENI, Ohm Energie, Wekiwi... in the crosshairs of the National Energy Mediator (MNE). These four suppliers are highlighted in the annual report of the public authority published this Tuesday, May 14, 2024 and consulted in advance by Le Parisien.

The national mediator accuses them of ""underestimate, in certain cases, sometimes deliberately, the amount of their clients' monthly payments"", reveals Olivier Challan Belval, who heads the Mediator's teams, in Le Parisien.

Two scenarios are detailed: in the first, the supplier approaches new customers, particularly by telephone, dangling ""attractive monthly payments&quot ; which ""do not correspond to reality"". In the second, concerning households that are already customers, the mediator highlights a gap, sometimes of several months, between the moment when the prices change and the moment when they are reflected in the invoices.

The consequences are similar: bills which can turn out to be very steep. 14,000 referrals and 27,350 disputes were recorded this year according to the report of the National Energy Mediator.

Suppliers dispute these criticisms. ""Under no circumstances do we deliberately under-evaluate monthly payments. Our rate adjustment deadlines do not exceed two months"", reacts in particular the director of the consumer market at Engie, quoted by Le Parisien.",bobrtimes.com,news,bobrtimes.com,,0.1450980392156862,453380369,6,,

The All-Australian defender has been kept quiet in the Giants' past two losses by Sydney's James Jordon and Essendon's Matt Guelfi.

While Whitfield still showed flashes of the damaging half-back he's known to be, his recent performances have been muted compared with his red-hot early-season form.

Before his duels with Jordon and Guelfi, Whitfield boasted an average of 31 disposals, eight marks and 495 metres gained per game.

In his past two matches, the 29-year-old has averaged 19 touches, one mark and 294 metres.

Both Jordon and Guelfi have also hit the scoreboard while playing as a defensive forward, with the latter slotting three majors in the Bombers' 20-point win over the Giants last round.

Expecting the Western Bulldogs to pay him close attention in Saturday's clash at Engie Stadium, Whitfield is getting back to basics.

""It makes life a bit harder, but I just need to learn how to get through those tags that are coming in at the moment,"" Whitfield told AAP.

""Matt did a great job on the weekend. He was able to shut me down and then hit the scoreboard on the way back, so he played really well.

""I've had them throughout my career and sporadically, so there's been times when I've been able to beat it and times when I haven't.

""I just need to keep learning and keep advancing on trying to beat them when they do come, but also just play my role as part of our back six.

""When it happens, 'Kingers' (coach Adam Kingsley) just says to me he doesn't want me to try any harder or do anything different. He just wants me to play as a defender and make sure I beat my man.

""I wasn't able to do that on the weekend, but I can definitely get better.""

It won't be all up to Whitfield to shake off his tag.

Fellow defender Connor Idun acknowledged the GWS backmen fell short of supporting Whitfield against Guelfi and will be aiming to rectify that.

""It's a tough one. Obviously, he's a star player, so he's going to get tagged most weeks,"" Idun told AAP.

Add solar farms, geothermal power and biomass plants, and Djibouti hopes to become the first country on the continent to supply its population with 100% renewable energy.

The construction of this project, which is part of our energy transition, is a decisive milestone in the energy sector,"" announced H.E. Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, President of the Republic, when he inaugurated the country's first wind farm in September 2023. Located near the Bay of Ghoubet, 120 km north of the capital, it is perched at an altitude of 230 metres. This mountainous site - the windiest in the country - is now home to 17 wind turbines with a total capacity of 60 MW.

""This is an important step towards achieving our goal of producing 100% of our electricity from inexhaustible renewable sources by 2035,"" continued President Guelleh.

The stakes are high for this ambitious country, which would like to improve its energy competitiveness in order to develop its industry. The country's annual electricity consumption is currently between 100 and 140 MW - but at a cost of 23 cents per kWh, one of the highest on the continent.

The wind farm is the first large-scale initiative by an independent power producer in the energy sector since the 2015 law liberalising the sector. For the government, the aim was to open up electricity production to independent operators so as to achieve energy independence as soon as possible. It should be noted that the state-owned company Électricité de Djibouti retains a monopoly on the transmission and distribution of electricity.

The project was developed by Red Sea Power (RSP). ""This site has the best wind energy potential in Africa, alongside Tangiers in Morocco,"" says François Maze, its CEO.

The farm cost around $130 million to build, which was supplied in part by an investor consortium led by RSP, consisting of the Africa Finance Corporation, an African development finance institution based in Nigeria, the Entrepreneurial Development Bank of the Netherlands, the fund manager Climate Fund Managers, and the investment company Great Horn Investment Holding, which is owned by the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority.

Djibouti contributed its own funds directly to the financing of this major operation via a public-private partnership. Red Sea Power is already planning to add a further 43 MW by installing thirteen new turbines, although no contract has yet been signed.

In ecological terms, the Ghoubet wind farm will enable Djibouti to reduce its C02 emissions by around 250,000 tonnes a year. At the same time, it will enable the country to reduce its energy dependence on Ethiopia, from which it currently imports around 50% of its electricity consumption via a high-voltage line. Finally, the project has a social component. The construction of a seawater desalination plant will supply water to two neighbouring villages, to the tune of 35m per day.

In its bid to become the first country on the continent to produce 100% green energy by 2035, Djibouti can also draw on other ambitious projects. These include the solar power project in the Grand Bara desert, for which work began in 2020. This voltaic power station will have a capacity of 25 MW, with the possibility of an extension of up to 100 MW. The project was originally developed by France's Engie, which withdrew in 2022 in favour of AMEA Power of the Emirates, which has signed a public-private partnership contract with the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Djibouti.

It will be the first national-scale solar power plant to meet electricity demand. ""We hope to start production by the first quarter of 2025,"" says Slim Feriani, CEO of the sovereign wealth fund, which holds a 25% stake in the project company. The project, like others, has been delayed by the global pandemic.

Because of its geographical position, at the meeting point of three major rifts - the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the East African Rift - Djibouti also has a rich resource buried in its subsoil: Geothermal energy.

President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh has been quick to make this a priority. In 2013, he created the Office Djiboutien de Développement de L'énergie Géothermique. According to studies carried out by the body, the country has more than 1.1 GW of geothermal resources underground. ""The potential has been confirmed and exploration has identified several zones,"" says Gouled Mohamed Djama, Director of Energy at the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.

In particular, a power station is due to be built at Fialé Caldera, near Lake Assal, a volcanic area with chimneys, fumaroles and hot springs. Djama underlines the potential of this energy source, which does not depend on external factors such as wind or sun: ""Geothermal energy can provide us with clean, constant energy. It has the potential to totally eliminate our dependence on thermal energy,"" he believes.

The country also has ambitions in biomass. A waste-to-energy plant with a capacity of 40 MW (including 5 MW reserved for its operation) is due to be built soon at Damerjog, in the south of the country. In 2020, a contract was signed with the American company CREC Energy, but the project was delayed by Covid.

The country is also carrying out pre-feasibility studies to produce tidal energy in the straits of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab (nicknamed 'the chasm of the demons') and Bab-el-Mandeb.

Finally, the government is exploring the potential of green hydrogen, a low-carbon energy carrier. Internationally renowned companies such as Australia's Fortescue Future Industries, the UAE's AMEA Power and US giant CWP Global have already begun pre-feasibility studies to produce hydrogen for export. In December 2023, the Republic of Djibouti signed up to the African Green Hydrogen Alliance.

The country's formidable prospects in terms of renewable energy means that Slim Feriani can look to the future with confidence. ""The objective for 2035 is to be self-sufficient in energy production,"" he says. ""We should get there before then. The idea would be to have an energy mix made up of solar and wind power, with some geothermal energy. There's also a project to convert waste into energy. It's a question of 'when', not 'if'. The political will is there,"" he assures us.

While lowering the cost of electricity remains one of the major challenges facing the country as it seeks to get its industry off the ground, things need to be done in order, according to Djama at the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. ""The priority is to convert our current consumption to renewable energy, then to increase the rate of access to electricity, particularly in the regions, and finally, the cost stage will come next,"" he says. ""We need to take a gradual approach to avoid price fluctuations. We will always be in the quest to produce more to meet growing demand.""

In his view, the country's energy consumption could double, or even triple, with the completion of projects such as the launch of the industrial port site at Damerjog, in the south of the country. ""To meet this demand, there should be an increase in the number of independent energy producers in the various sectors - wind, solar and geothermal,"" he believes.

This specialist is betting heavily on the development of biomass and geothermal projects. ""If these renewable energy sources materialise in the next three years, we will really be able to take the decision to drastically lower the price of electricity, because we would find ourselves in a situation of energy abundance,"" he continues.

In the meantime, the director is calling for people to be more aware of their energy consumption, as air conditioning often causes bills to soar.

Lowering the cost of electricity is a major challenge for Djibouti, but the benefits would be substantial. According to the World Bank, reducing the cost of electricity and telecommunications could increase real GDP by 39.1% by 2030, generate 23,000 jobs and considerably boost household incomes, while reducing poverty.

The All-Australian defender has been kept quiet in the Giants' past two losses by Sydney's James Jordon and Essendon's Matt Guelfi.

While Whitfield still showed flashes of the damaging half-back he's known to be, his recent performances have been muted compared with his red-hot early-season form.

Before his duels with Jordon and Guelfi, Whitfield boasted an average of 31 disposals, eight marks and 495 metres gained per game.

In his past two matches, the 29-year-old has averaged 19 touches, one mark and 294 metres.

Both Jordon and Guelfi have also hit the scoreboard while playing as a defensive forward, with the latter slotting three majors in the Bombers' 20-point win over the Giants last round.

Expecting the Western Bulldogs to pay him close attention in Saturday's clash at Engie Stadium, Whitfield is getting back to basics.

""It makes life a bit harder, but I just need to learn how to get through those tags that are coming in at the moment,"" Whitfield told AAP.

""Matt did a great job on the weekend. He was able to shut me down and then hit the scoreboard on the way back, so he played really well.

""I've had them throughout my career and sporadically, so there's been times when I've been able to beat it and times when I haven't.

""I just need to keep learning and keep advancing on trying to beat them when they do come, but also just play my role as part of our back six.

""When it happens, 'Kingers' (coach Adam Kingsley) just says to me he doesn't want me to try any harder or do anything different. He just wants me to play as a defender and make sure I beat my man.

RALEIGH, N.C., May 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ndustrial, the AI-powered energy intensity platform for industry, today announced the initial close of $18.5 million in a Series B funding round co-led by ABB and GS Energy, joining existing partners such as Clean Energy Ventures and ENGIE New Ventures. The capital will be used to power growth and accelerate innovation to help industrial companies optimize the crucial metric of energy intensity -- the amount of energy, emissions and cost required for one unit of production. Ndustrial will also partner with ABB and GS Energy to offer its energy intensity solutions to industrial customers, further advancing its mission to unite hard-to-access energy and production data in real time to deliver transformative economic and decarbonization value.

""Championing sustainability and guiding customers to achieve net zero carbon is at the core of what we do,"" said Stuart Thompson, President, ABB Electrification Service. ""Under this agreement, ABB is adding Ndustrial to our ecosystem of innovative, nimble partners to co-develop advancements in digital solutions to complement our portfolio and enhance the availability, resilience, safety and sustainability of energy for customers. Together, we can help customers make AI-powered decisions in real time to optimize production, save energy, and reduce costs and emissions.""

""With a track record of delivering measurable results in reducing energy costs without sacrificing throughput, Ndustrial has demonstrated the potential to scale energy optimization at industrial facilities,"" said Jungho Cho, Executive Vice President, GS Holdings and Head of Global Investments, GS Energy. ""Ndustrial's experience in integrating multiple data sources to navigate through complex equations in energy intensity of large production processes, as well as its customer-centric business model, gives it a unique edge in scaling turnkey solutions in energy management. We look forward to the partnership with Ndustrial and its stakeholders.""

""Ndustrial has helped us deliver impressive cost and energy savings across our global operations for a number of years,"" said Adam Forste, co-founder and co-executive chairman of Lineage, which operates the world's largest network of cold chain facilities. ""The team has been a partner in building out one of Lineage's largest data platforms and pipelines, which is integral to our ability to launch our proprietary optimizations and significantly impact our bottom line.""

Industrial facilities are complex and lack standardization, drawing on a range of aging systems and solutions unique to each operation. Companies have long relied on an army of consultants to develop and manage custom systems to analyze energy and carbon data and reduce costs, a time-consuming, costly process.

Ndustrial's AI-powered platform brings together hard-to-access production and energy data from nearly any industrial system to give customers a real-time understanding of energy intensity. The company's streamlined, user-friendly dashboard enables real-time insights for specific facilities and production lines, helping global industrial sites make better decisions and directly avoid over $100M in energy spend in the past decade.

Ndustrial integrates more than 60 data sources to enable active load management behind the meter, optimize production, and enable next-generation carbon intensity measurement and verification. The company is the only one to provide activity-driven Scope 3 carbon emissions data rather than algorithmic approximations. Customers include W.L. Gore (makers of GORE-TEX), Novonesis, and US Cold Storage; Lineage realized a 30% reduction in both energy costs and energy intensity by partnering with Ndustrial, equivalent to powering 250,000 homes annually.

""In a high inflation world, it's staggering to consider that half of industrial energy is wasted. That's putting industrial businesses under rising pressure to reduce both production and energy costs, all while developing and maintaining new systems to meet growing demands for carbon emissions data,"" said Jason Massey Founder & CEO at Ndustrial. ""Ndustrial's production-aware technology empowers industrial leaders to finally wrap their arms around their data in real-time, understand the relationships between production cycles and energy use, report Scope 3 emissions and take action immediately. ABB and GS Energy are ideal partners to scale our business to help more industrial companies reduce costs and decarbonize faster.""

The Blues have the easiest last nine games of any team, according to Foxfooty.com.au's analysis, which is based on the average percentage of their opponents in those fixtures.

While Michael Voss' men will battle contenders GWS (Engie), Port Adelaide (Marvel) and Collingwood (MCG) plus a Bulldogs side with a very strong percentage (Marvel), they also get very winnable games against Richmond (MCG), North Melbourne (Marvel), Hawthorn (MCG), West Coast (Optus) and St Kilda (Marvel) - the latter three games ending the season.

The Cats, with the second-easiest draw, have four games at the Cattery including visits by Hawthorn and West Coast, plus games against North Melbourne (Hobart) and St Kilda (Marvel).

The Blues and Cats are the only true contenders in the group of six easiest fixtures.

In contrast the Bombers, who have a relatively easy run into the bye weeks, will want to bank their wins early. They face four current top-eight teams in their last nine games but also dangerous sides outside the eight like Adelaide, Fremantle, Gold Coast and Brisbane; though on the plus side they have just one game (Round 24 vs Brisbane) interstate.

The draw is also commercially favourable with plenty of primetime fixtures.

Adelaide and Brisbane's slow starts to the year are compounded by their difficult draws to end the season, ranking second and fourth-hardest, while Port Adelaide - after passing a big test against Geelong last Friday night - will need to pass even more of them with the third-toughest run.

Walyalup (Fremantle) have been shut out of Friday night football for the remainder of the season, despite sitting just outside the top-eight, but they will face West Coast in a prime time western derby.

The AFL confirmed the dates and times for matches between rounds 16 and 23 on Tuesday. It was revealed earlier the league would can popular Thursday night fixtures for the back end of the season.

The Eagles have been subjected to mostly Sunday fixtures to end their season, but they will play one off-Broadway Friday night clash at home against Gold Coast in round 21.

It is the second of two matches that night, with Western Bulldogs to face Melbourne at Marvel Stadium on the same evening.

Resurgent Essendon and reigning premiers Collingwood both feature prominently in the remaining rounds and will meet in a heavyweight Friday night clash in round 17.

West Coast host Hawthorn on a Sunday afternoon in round 16, then travel to Melbourne to play the Demons at the MCG seven days later and return to face Brisbane in a run of four straight Sunday games before a Saturday meeting with St Kilda in round 19.

Fremantle play Sydney in round 16, Richmond at home in round 17 and Hawthorn in Launceston in round 18 on consecutive Saturdays, before a Sunday home clash with the Demons and the round 20 derby.

West Coast stunned the Dockers in the season's earlier derby in a similar timeslot, with their second meeting to begin at 6.10pm AWST.

That game begins 40 minutes after a blockbuster between Melbourne and Greater Western Sydney at the MCG.

West Coast face North Melbourne in Hobart in the early game on a Saturday in round 22 and the Dockers face Essendon on a Sunday and Geelong on a Saturday afternoon to round out their confirmed fixtures.

The Dockers' meetings with Melbourne at home and Essendon at the MCG will be broadcast nationwide on Channel 7.

The round 24 fixture will be revealed weeks out, to allow the AFL flexibility in its prime time scheduling. Fremantle will face Port Adelaide and West Coast play Geelong.

Will the Swans get revenge on the Blues?,"Each club's big question: Is Ollie Wines back? Will the Swans get revenge on the Blues?

What's the big question your AFL club must answer in Round 10? Is Ollie Wines back? Can the Bombers get their percentage up to scratch? Will Sydney exact revenge for last year's elimination final loss?

We've looked at every club and answered their biggest question ahead of this week's action.

Recent history says Adelaide is no chance of upsetting Collingwood this weekend. The Crows haven't won at the MCG since 2017, losing eight straight games at the venue over the last seven years. They also haven't beaten the Magpies since 2016, again, currently riding an eight-game losing streak to the black and white army. When you put the two together it's even more grim. Adelaide boasts just one win over Collingwood at the home of football since 2009. Will history repeat?

Can the Lions flex and regain some ground in the percentage stakes?

If Brisbane belts Richmond this weekend, nobody is going to be jumping up and down arguing they're well and truly back in the premiership mix. However, they can correct one issue, a pretty average percentage -- quite literally -- of 100.3. Even with last week's draw, percentage will be critical. Four teams now have those pesky extra two points, and who knows if any of them draw again and get back in line with the others. The Tigers have lost their last four games by 39, 43, 54, and, most recently 91 points. Expect a big number here.

Carlton has been the kings of the tight win in 2024, but in many cases, the games should have never been that close. Look at last week's late capitulation against the Demons! In nearly a half of football, the Blues kicked just two goals and were lucky to hold on and win by a point. If they are to travel to the SCG and knock off a Sydney side that's looking better than anyone in the competition, they must find a way to play four quarters and not suffer those debilitating down periods.

The make-up of Collingwood's forward line mix this weekend against the Crows will be fascinating. Defender Jeremy Howe was the stop gap, but he will miss after suffering a groin injury. Brody Mihocek and Beau McCreery are also expected to sit out again. Does Craig McRae opt to go tall or small? Speed or height? Does the inconsistent Ash Johnson earn a recall? Or perhaps, Jordan De Goey returns to the team from a groin strain of his own and plays a larger role forward of centre.

Can the Bombers boost their percentage and therefore finals hopes?

Take a look at the top eight. Essendon is sitting third - very nice from a side not many expected to do that well this season. But take another look, specifically at the percentage of the teams in the top eight. There's a single outlier - the Bombers, with a percentage under 100. In fact, the Bombers are 13th on the percentage ladder. Usually over the course of a season, percentage is a great indication of how a side is truly travelling, and the Dons have room for improvement. That starts this week against a winless North. Boost that number, boys!

Was it wrong for Fremantle to have to play just hours after learning of the death of former teammate Cam McCarthy? Maybe. The Dockers played perhaps their worst game of the season, falling to the Swans by 48 points at Optus Stadium. Given the sad circumstances surrounding the game, it's tricky to read too far into it, but the club, and its supporters, will be looking to bounce back this week in what's a very winnable game against St Kilda, albeit on the road. A loss will only spark further concerns.

Just a fortnight ago, Geelong was all the rage. Talks of Chris Scott's third premiership began heating up and their apparent weaknesses didn't seem to be impacting them. Since then, they've lost to Melbourne -- no shame in that -- and Port Adelaide at GMHBA Stadium for the first time in 17 years. If they want to avoid a three-game skid, the Cats will have to pass this week's tricky test: the Darwin Suns. Gold Coast has won its last five games in the Top End and last week were able to get familiar with the conditions, thumping the Kangaroos by 10 goals. Fascinating match-up.

Do the Suns seriously consider relocating to Darwin?

So much has been made of Gold Coast's stunning record in Darwin. The Suns are 5-0 since mid-2022, the most recent win coming last week when they belted the Kangaroos by 68 points. Damien Hardwick's side remains in the Top End for this week's clash, and there's no doubt it's a far tougher assignment. With that said, if they can find a way to knock off the Cats, calls for the club to relocate to Darwin -- a city the AFL has expressed interest in expanding into -- will only grow louder.

Can the Giants salute back at home for the first time in nearly two months?

Everything was going swimmingly for GWS. Adam Kingsley's began the season 5-0, but has since lost three of its last four to Carlton, Sydney, and now Essendon. All three teams are top eight side at the present time, but the Giants would be bitterly disappointed to have one just once in the past month, even if it was a 54-point rout of the up-and-down Lions. This week they face another inconsistent side: the Bulldogs, finally back at Engie Stadium for the first time since before Easter. Can they get things back on track and solidify a top four spot with a win or will the alarm bells be sounding after a fourth loss in five games?

Can the Hawks compete against a good team on the road?

The Saints in Tasmania is one equation, and they passed the test with flying colours in a low-scoring scrap, but can Hawthorn really take it up to a good side? And on the road? It's a big test for Sam Mitchell's Hawks, but an encouraging performance this week in Adelaide will go a long way to satisfying fans that the rebuild is moving along at a good pace. Remember last year? The Power piled on 16 goals in the first half to post a half time score of 105. The Hawks can't let that happen again.

Take out the first term against the Blues last week and Melbourne win the game by six goals. Instead, their horror first term -- in which they were held scoreless -- ultimately proved the difference and the reason why they fell short by a solitary point. The Eagles are an improved side in recent times, but nobody is expecting them to upset a Demons side that has very real premiership aspirations. Instead, Simon Goodwin needs to hope for a strong start. This season, the Dees are averaging just 16 points in first terms. Need to be better than that.

Little wins, right? Well, North gets the chance to face Essendon, and former player Ben McKay this weekend, and wouldn't it be sweet if Nick Larkey could get his season going with a bag against a former teammate?

In the absence of Connor Rozee last week, it was a former skipper who wound back the clocked and stepped up for his side. Many had written off Ollie Wines as a bit of a has-been - a player who had peaked and was being superceded in a stacked midfield. But his performance last week against the Cats showed he has enough in the tank to step up when his side needs it. Can he back it up? The Hawks have shown signs of improvement, and Port will need to win and well in order to keep in touch with the top four.

Can the Tigers show something and keep it competitive?

Things have gradually gotten worse for Richmond over the last month. They backed up their stunning win against Sydney -- no idea how that happened -- with a tight, competitive loss against the Saints during Gather Round. Since then, they have been beaten by West Coast (39 points), Melbourne (43 points), Fremantle (54 points), and the Western Bulldogs (91 points). It's a worrying trend for Adem Yze and his side needs to find something -- and quickly -- otherwise a wooden spoon isn't out of the question...

Can the Saints kick a genuine winning score against a defensive-minded team?

Oh boy, this looks like a tough watch, on paper. Two teams which have at times this year been dire in attack, and with the Saints now languishing in 14th above only Hawthorn, West Coast, Richmond, and North Melbourne, there is significant pressure on Ross Lyon, his game plan, and his troops to post a home win over the Dockers. They managed just seven goals last week, and with Fremantle -- a notoriously stingy side -- looming, it could go from bad to worse if St Kilda lose.

Can the Swans exact revenge from last year's elimination final?

It was Carlton who sent Sydney packing in last year's final series after an epic six-point win at the MCG. Don't think the Swans have forgotten! John Longmire's side is looking like the premiership favourite in the early part of 2024, sitting top of the ladder with an 8-1 record and a percentage over 150! In last year's final it was hard-running Blue Sam Walsh who proved the difference, so it's possible the Swans put some attention into him.

It's no secret West Coast has been struggling immensely in recent seasons, but Adam Simpson's side showed some signs they might have turned a corner with back-to-back wins over Richmond and Fremantle, as well as tight losses to Sydney and Essendon. But last week's 66-point loss to Collingwood -- and it really should have been more -- suggested the gap between the Eagles and the sides vying for a place in the top four remains as large as ever. A similar type loss to the Demons this week might undo all of the good work in the first two months of the season.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. We've seen this movie before from the Bulldogs. Smash a lowly side and then embarrass themselves the following week. Rinse and repeat. On the surface, you simply can't read anything into last week's thumping of the struggling Tigers. But it could be viewed as the start of a turnaround if they are able to head north and upset old rival, GWS. Maybe, just maybe, Richmond has played the Bulldogs into form.",espn.com.au,news,ESPN.com,,-0.2392156862745098,453329626,1,https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0513%2Fr1332219_2_1296x729_16%2D9.png,eng-9571865

Definition:

As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, the demand for EV charging infrastructure grows. Software for EV charging stations helps manage the charging process, including monitoring station usage, handling payments, providing real-time availability information to drivers, and integrating with other systems like navigation apps to help users find charging stations.

Market Trends:

Interoperability Is a Prerequisite for the Mainstreaming of Evs: Roaming refers to an EV driver's capacity to use a variety of charging stations even if they're solely a consumer of one carrier provider. In practice, it potential that electric car drivers can use charging stations with simply one patron account. Roaming is something all favour to do. EV drivers demand interoperability.

There are two methods to arrange roaming: one is centralized and the different is peer to peer. Unfortunately, in the centralized roaming markets there is now uneven opposition between charging operators: There are charging operators that do no longer prefer to open their networks to others. They have separate EMP services, however they nonetheless choose to have get right of entry to different players' charging networks whilst maintaining their EMP provider separate. This uneven world continues the expenses high.

Market Drivers:

Rising EV Sales Worldwide Will Increase Demand for EV Charging Stations The demand for charging infrastructure has grown as electric vehicle acceptance and use have risen. Leading EV markets like China, the US, and Germany are spending heavily in EV charging infrastructure in addition to R&D for quicker and more effective charging techniques. Automakers are anticipated to make large expenditures to meet the growing demand for EVs and to shape the industry. For the development of EVs, companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, Ford, Nissan, BMW, and General Motors have large R&D budgets. Despite COVID-19's negative effects on the market, there were around 3 million EV sales worldwide in 2020, and the global vehicle market shrank by 6%. This shows a developing demand for electric powered vehicles. Which will, in turn, enhance the market for EV charging stations. While the majority of EV customers deploy a Level 1 or Level two EV charging gadget in their domestic or residential complex, there has additionally been a developing demand for public charging stations round the world. With the developing EV income round the world, the demand for EV charging stations will increase. Factors such as the boom of the electric powered automobile market and editions in charging masses have emphasised the want for the standardization of electric powered automobile charging stations. Certain EV charging stations may additionally solely be like minded with a sure kind of voltage. For instance, AC charging stations grant a voltage of 120V AC via stage 1 charging stations and 208/240V AC via stage 2 charging stations. On the different hand, DC charging stations supply quick charging thru 480V AC. Germans have opened the dialog at the EU stage on how to modify roaming. There is a sturdy want to alter the EV charging roaming in the shape of pricing or contractual regulation, however now not in the shape of regulating the technology. Because deciding on simply one technological know-how or one answer skill that we would take a step backwards. There are numerous applied sciences already in the market and quite a few new ones are being developed as we speak. It is indispensable to maintain the roaming science neutral.

The long-term contractable capacity of approximately 10.5M tonnes per annum is fully subscribed under long-term agreements with counterparties including major firms ConocoPhillips, RWE Supply and Trading, INEOS and Engie.

In a status report filed with the FERC, Port Arthur LNG said Bechtel has continued metal-organic framework construction activities. In May, Bechtel will continue site preparation, soil stabilisation and deliver the concrete piles.

Net income is down to US$801M (from US$969M) and revenues have nose dived to US$3.6Bn (from US$6.6Bn). The natural gas division saw earnings cut in half to US$2.1Bn.

It was a different kind of heartbreak for Crows fans on Sunday evening, with the third draw in their club's history keeping them two games away from reaching the top eight. Overall, a draw against last year's grand finalists is far from a terrible result, but they'll know they could've come away with an extra two points on a not so different day.

In the votes

Captain Jordan Dawson (27 disposals, 11 inside 50's, seven tackles) and Matt Crouch (28 disposals, 13 tackles) led from the front in Adelaide's midfield, while Izak Rankine (24 disposals, nine score involvements, three goals) and Darcy Fogarty (14 disposals, seven marks, four goals) were prolific up forward. Reilly O'Brien (15 disposals, 56 hitouts) had a day out in the ruck, but won't poll come Brownlow night.

Room for improvement

The Crows were a handball-happy side on Sunday evening, and may have benefited from trying to move on the ball by foot at times when the game allowed. Their efficiency moving inside 50 and clearance work was very good, but they allowed the Lions far too many marks across the ground - especially contested. All in all it was a solid effort, but if they want to keep pushing for an unlikely finals birth, they'll need to prevent sides from controlling the ball so much around the ground by marks.

Much like the Crows, the Lions will ultimately be disappointed they didn't finish the job in what would have been a huge away win. Given their recent injury history, the Lions will probably take the two points regardless and use the match as a learning experience of sorts in what was an extremely hard-fought game of footy.

In the votes

Jarrod Berry (30 disposals, six clearances, one goal) was arguably best on ground for Chris Fagan's side, while Josh Dunkley (22 disposals, nine tackles, one goal) continued his incredible run in 2024 - even if it didn't completely show on the stat sheet. Callum Ah Chee (14 disposals, four goals) was awesome up forward, and proved it's not just up to Joe Daniher, Charlie Cameron and Eric Hipwood to keep the scoreboard ticking over.

Room for improvement

The Lions were beaten comfortably in the contested ball - surprising given their midfield that includes Dunkley and Lachie Neale. They obviously know how to keep the game on their terms with their marking game, but they were at times caught lacking with the Crows' slingshot - left for dead and chasing instead of keeping their opponents in front of the ball.

If you were a Carlton fan and only watched until three-quarter time, you'd have been thrilled. For the Blues were in control for the majority of Thursday night's clash against the Demons before Christian Petracca took over to create a pulse for his side it ran on with to nearly run over the top at the death. No matter, Michael Voss' side held its nerve in the one-point win to claim yet another close win in 2024 and improve to 6-3. A hamstring setback to Adam Cerra was the only sour note on the night.

In the votes

Sam Walsh was enormous, finishing with 34 disposals, 11 tackles and one goal and providing elite two-way running to consistently break lines. Patrick Cripps also had a big night in the middle with 35 touches, 19 contested and a goal, while Matthew Owies kicked three goals.

Room for improvement

The Blues simply went into 'save the game' mode too early in an 0therwise impressive showing. But had they lost, it would've been a robbery. As Matt Kennedy told foxfooty.com.au post-match, Carlton was ""reactive"" and ""want to defend hard but still be aggressive"" in another learning experience for the club as it continues to grow into a bona fide contender.

The reigning premiers flexed their muscles against West Coast in a 66-point trashing - Collingwood's biggest win of the season. Clearly the most impressive Craig McRae's side has looked this year, albeit, against an inexperienced opposition, it saw the Pies climb into the top eight for the first time this season. Joe Richards shined on debut and Fin Macrae kicked three goals in his return as Collingwood's depth was on show with several big guns missing. And the Pies' injury list grew larger, with Jeremy Howe (groin), Jack Bytel (concussed) and Harvey Harrison (ankle) all struck down on the day.

In the votes

Nick Daicos did Nick Daicos things, racking up 36 touches, 17 contested, seven tackles and a goal. Daicos was at times matched up on fellow young star Harley Reid in an exciting duel. Jack Crisp's (32 disposals, 12 contested, one goal) burst from stoppage was again crucial and Scott Pendlebury (28 possessions) and Josh Daicos (28 touches) were also busy as per usual.

Room for improvement

Most complete performance from the Pies yet where they've built invaluable depth in their squad now with the likes of Richards, Macrae, Lachie Sullivan and Reef McInness staking their claim for spots even when the cavalry returns. Only downside of the day was more injury setbacks.

It was a coming of age of sorts for the Bombers, who finally claimed a big enough scalp for pundits to count them in as legitimate finals contenders. They beat the seemingly unbeatable orange tsunami with their defence, and are now poised very well for a finals birth, given their home-and-away draw for the remainder of 2024.

In the votes

Half back Mason Redman (26 disposals, 12 marks, one goal) was elite from the defensive half, and gave the Bombers a run that fans will be praying for the rest of this season. Kyle Langford (14 disposals, four goals, four tackles inside 50) looked like a man who deserves an All-Australian jacket, while Nic Martin (31 disposals, 10 marks, 650 metres gained) had plenty of the ball once again.

Room for improvement

There really isn't much for the Bombers to improve on, given how well they stood up despite the quiet(er) performances of Darcy Parish and Zach Merrett. Their low number of one-percenters might be looked at internally, but that would really be clutching at straws for anyone on the outside to criticise them for it.

The Dockers fell to Sydney in a game played under duress for Fremantle after the tragic death of Cameron McCarthy. It made for emotional scenes at Optus Stadium, with the Dockers handling themselves with grace and class. Justin Longmuir's side did a lot right on the night but just didn't convert its shots, with a 4.15 return in front goal. As the old adage goes, bad kicking is bad football.

In the votes

Jeremy Sharp was super to continue his impressive first season at the Dockers on the wing, racking up 28 touches with 10 marks and two goals. Caleb Serong had another big game too with 34 touches, 11 contested.

Room for improvement

As mentioned, the Docker didn't maximise their chances. The 48-point loss wasn't a true reflection of how the match was played, with Fremantle winning clearances (+1) and only narrowly losing inside 50s (-5). We can overcomplicate a simple game sometimes, for if you don't kick straight, you simply can't win.

The Cats dropped a rare game at their home fortress on Friday night, and have all of a sudden lost back-to-back games. With a six-day break heading up Darwin to play the Gold Coast, the 2022 premiers are far more vulnerable than what they'd want to be - especially with the loss of Jeremy Cameron and his delayed concussion.

In the votes

Tyson Stengle (10 disposals, four goals) was a light up forward for Geelong, and performed consistently all night. Zach Guthrie (24 disposals, seven rebound 50's, one goal) was again good off half back, while Gryan Miers (21 disposals, six inside 50's, one goal) was commendable. Unfortunately for Cats fans, none of the trio are likely to poll come Brownlow night.

Room for improvement

Chris Scott's side was whacked in most stat lines, and beaten in almost everything - with contested marks the only outlier. Subsequently, it's probably fair to say that while they lacked in areas they normally win, they were simply beaten by the better team. Their comeback in the second half was impressive, and shouldn't be forgotten by opposition sides anytime soon.

It took a little while for the Suns to get going in Saturday night's clash with North Melbourne before Damien Hardwick's side put its foot down in the second half - kicking 12 goals to five in a total domination. A host of young Suns stepping up would've been particularly pleasing for the club, while it marked the Suns' fifth-straight win at TIO Stadium - a stadium it's turned into a fortress. Up Next? Gold Coast hosts Geelong at Darwin next Thursday night.

In the votes

Touk Miller relished the dewy conditions in one of his best games of the season, racking up 29 touches, 11 contested, five tackles and a goal. Sam Clohesy probably played he best game of his six-game career with 23 disposals, 634 metres gained and two goals, while Mac Andrew had 22 possessions, nine intercepts and 10 marks.

Room for improvement

Damien Hardwick was pleased with his side's effort at half-time, but lamented it not ""capitalising"" on the scoreboard. The Suns responded with a 12 goal second half in a real percentage and confidence booster.

There is only one way to phrase the Giants' loss on Saturday evening - disappointing. While they controlled the first half, resisting Essendon's impending run, they were run over by the Dons in the second half. It was a game fans would've ticked off as an expected win going into the weekend, and now leaves slight questions marks over their premiership credentials.

In the votes

Tom Green (34 disposals, seven clearances) had plenty of the ball, but likely not enough impact to poll a vote come Brownlow night. Jesse Hogan (12 disposals, two goals) performed far better than his stat line suggests, but also won't poll. Kieran Briggs (16 disposals, 25 hitouts, 10 clearances) was a brute all game, but his disposal efficiency acted as a blight on his true impact.

Room for improvement

Not allowing the opposition to control the game so much with a heavy marking game. It doesn't always work for teams, but when it does, it makes it really hard for a team like the Giants to win back control when they can't dictate the pace of the game. Beyond that, they were marginally beaten in most areas with no major concerns - the next couple of weeks will tell us whether or not this was just an off day.

Hawthorn was the better outfit from the outset against St Kilda at UTAS Stadium on Saturday, building its slender but insurmountable lead off the back of consistent suffocating pressure and capitalising on forward-half turnovers. Fox Footy's Garry Lyon labelled the pressuring impact the Hawks forwards provided as ""magnificent"", giving the Saints ""all sorts of trouble."" With key-forward targets Mitch Lewis and Mabior Chol absent, the Hawks were light-on for tall goalkicking options, as second-gamer Calsher Dear became the de-facto focal point of Sam Mitchell's attack while the smalls got to work at ground level. Hawthorn has been proficient at winning the ball once it hits the grass, and that was evident in Saturday's five-point win.

In the votes

Karl Amon (31 disposals at 94 per cent efficiency) was the equal-leading ball-winner on the ground in a standout performance. Jai Newcombe also had 31 disposals and registered 17 contested possessions and eight clearances. While he was ultimately outduelled by Rowan Marshall on the day, Lloyd Meek was terrific in Tassie, notching 12 disposals at 83 per cent efficiency, four marks, 46 hit-outs -- 14 to advantage -- eight tackles and a goal. Dylan Moore kicked two goals as he captained the side in James Sicily's absence.

Room for improvement

Tough to find a heap. Hawthorn was manic with its pressure and only allowed the Saints three goals from 28 second-half inside-50s, but they were -33 in uncontested marks and -19 in uncontested possessions; beaten in a facet of their game that has been an evident focal point this season.

It took for Melbourne to be six goals down to wake up in Thursday night's loss to the Blues. But boy did they give it a shake. Credit where it's due, the Demons never threw in and the towel including Christian Petracca willing them back into the game with a dominant five-goal performance. The loss saw Simon Goodwin's side fall to 6-3 in 2024.

In the votes

Petracca was on another level, with his move forward a masterstroke from Goodwin. He finished with five goals from 21 disposals plus six tackles in one of the best game of the superstar's Demon's career. Jack Viney (21 touches, 12 tackles) and Max Gawn (17 disposals, 45 hit-outs, one goal) were also instrumental through the midfield in helping turn the tide.

Room for improvement

Not giving up the first six goals would help. Outside of that slow start, Melbourne was solid enough and competed hard until the final siren. The Dees are still crying out for more consistent firepower up forward given the reliance on Petracca's spark up there, with Harrison Petty (goalless), Kysaiah Pickett, Jacob van Rooyen and Daniel Turner (all one goal each) quiet.

The Roos' winless start to 2024 continued in a 68-point loss to the Suns in Darwin. North probably had the better of Gold Coast in the first quarter, but couldn't convert it to the scoreboard, before collapsing thereafter in another uncompetitive performance from Alastair Clarkson's troops. Brownlow medallist Gerard Healy was ""disappointed"" in the Roos' work rate and inability to get back in the game. It's now hard to see where North's next win is going to come from ahead of clashes against Essendon and Port Adelaide leading into its bye.

In the votes

Luke Davies-Uniacke left it all out there including a particularly strong second half, finishing with 35 touches, 17 contested, a goal and nine clearances. Meanwhile Zac Fisher racked up a career-best 34 touches in a sweeper role, albeit maximising how much ball came to the Roos' back half.

Room for improvement

There's still problems everywhere for Clarkson's side. The Roos were again opened up too easily defensively and didn't have the same composure when they went forward. They were also soundly beaten in contested ball (-18), clearances (-9) and inside 50s (-22)

The Power responded in the best way possible to their Showdown loss in Round 8, beating Geelong at home for the first time since Round 21, 2007. Their first half performance was something to behold, however they had fend off a late Cats comeback that threatened to spoil the party.

In the votes

It was the midfield that stole the show at Kardinia Park, with Ollie Wines (33 disposals, 11 score involvements, nine clearances, one goal) turning back the clock to play some of his best ever football. Zak Butters (34 disposals, five inside 50's, one goal) stood up all night, while Jason Horne-Francis (26 disposals, seven clearances, six inside 50's) rounded out great match for the engine room. Willie Rioli (12 disposals, seven tackles, four goals) was a livewire up forward for the Power, and Dan Houston (24 disposals, nine marks, 473 metres gained) was great off half-back.

Room for improvement

Statistically there wasn't much to improve on for Ken Hinkley and his men - it was really just a matter of not allowing Geelong back in the game late. Their great work for the vast majority of the night nearly came undone, so closing out matches with more polish could be on the cards. Hinkley deserves a massive tick for sending Jed McEntee to five-time All-Australian Tom Stewart, who clamped down the defender flawlessly all night.

It was the worst nightmare of every Richmond fan on Saturday night, succumbing to the Western Bulldogs in (at the time) the heaviest defeat yet of 2024. Their 91-point loss was made significantly worse with injuries to Jack Graham, Sam Banks and Maurice Rioli Jnr, and now leave the club in complete disarray.

In the votes

There won't be any Tigers polling come Brownlow night in Round 9, but Daniel Rioli (26 disposals, six tackles) and Dion Prestia (23 disposals, one goal) were commendable.

Room for improvement

Everywhere...? There were little to no positives for the Tigers, and it looks to only get harder in coming weeks. The sheer number of scoring shots (38) was a reflection of their poor midfield and defence, while the Bulldogs registering 451 disposals is something in itself. Hopefully a fresh slate next week will do the Tigers some good.

The Saints were the lesser side from the outset in Tasmania on Saturday, falling into an early hole that proved insurmountable. On numerous occasions, St Kilda cowered to Hawthorn's manic pressure and conceded scores from back-half turnovers. Fox Footy's Garry Lyon said Ross Lyon's men ""never turned it up"", adding they'll be ""disappointed"" with their uninspiring ball movement. The Saints are now 3-6 after making the finals last year.

In the votes

Hard to argue Rowan Marshall wasn't St Kilda's best on Saturday. In addition to his whopping 28 disposals, 23 contested possessions, 11 tackles and eight inside-50s, Marshall won a staggering 12 clearances. Those 23 contested possessions were the most ever for a St Kilda player in a game. Jack Steele recorded an equal-team-high 30 disposals and laid a team-high 13 tackles. Cal Wilkie took 14 marks and was hugely important to the Saints' cause in a losing effort.

Room for improvement

While Max King's efforts may come under the microscope, ball movement is the main one from Saturday. The Saints were labelled ""stagnant"" and ""slow"" in the first half in Launceston, and while they staged a late surge, it came too late on an afternoon where they didn't threaten the Hawks often enough offensively -- particularly as they were without James Sicily and have been undermanned in defence all season.

A professional performance from the Swans in travelling to Optus Stadium and putting away an in-form Dockers team with relative ease. It was a convincing performance from Sydney, who never really looked vulnerable including kicking nine goals to Freo's one in the first half. The 8-1 Swans train is rolling along nicely, extending its lead at the top of the ladder, where it now sits a game clear after Geelong's loss to Port.

In the votes

Isaac Heeney continued his Brownlow form with 28 touches, 22 by foot, and two goals in another likely three-vote performance. Oliver Florent (28 touches, 13 marks, one goal) was busy across half back and Chad Warner (23 disposals, two goals) was razor sharp in the midfield as usual.

Room for improvement

Hard to fault the Swans in a big statement on the road to stamp themselves as the premier side in the competition, though it's fair to point out the scoreboard flattered them a little bit, given how inaccurate Freo were.

Adam Simpson's side was out of its depth against the Pies in a game that was nearly out of reach by quarter-time, eventually falling by 66 points. It marked West Coast's second-lowest score of the season (37) and clearly its worst performance in some time after an encouraging stretch, albeit, missing a host of stars. Injuries to Jeremy McGovern (internal) and Jack Petruccelle (ankle) only added to their injury list, too.

In the votes

Alex Witherden (31 touches, eight marks) had plenty of the ball down back, though it was coming down there a lot. Liam Duggan (27 disposals) was also busy across half back, moving into the midfield in the second half in a bid to make the Eagles more competitive in the trenches.

Room for improvement

West Coast was pretty well dominated in all facets of the game, almost to the point that the 66-point result was flattering. It starts in the midfield though, with Simpson's on-ball group clearly missing Elliot Yeo, smashed in contested possessions (-29), clearances (-9) and inside 50s (-25).

There isn't much to say about Luke Beveridge's men, who absolutely annihilated the Tigers in an ugly MCG mauling. Their stars stood up, their forward line showed some much needed synergy and the pressure is off Beveridge... for now!

In the votes

Where to start? Adam Treloar (41 disposals, nine inside 50's, one goal) was monumental, Ed Richards (34 disposals, 12 inside 50's, 10 tackles) showed that he is absolutely a midfield option moving forward, and James Harmes (27 disposals, 11 marks, four goals) played one of the games of his life. Incredibly, Marcus Bontempelli (32 disposals, 14 score involvements, 10 clearances, two goals) may struggle to poll - despite his huge game. Aaron Naughton (20 disposals, 10 marks, four goals) was also a shining light up forward.

Room for improvement

Hitouts was the only generic stat line that the Bulldogs were beaten in, after an incredible performance. It's a week-by-week process for the men at Whitten Oval, and consistency will be their biggest room for improvement. It's all well and good to knock the Tigers out of the park, but now they need to take their form into next weekend's clash against GWS at ENGIE Stadium.",foxsports.com.au,news,Fox Sports,,0.03529411764705892,453240474,1,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/0f46aafbbc1d65447c9b316c469bdcb8,eng-9568479

The event focuses on achievements towards Net Zero and what a carbon neutral future will look like for organisations and individuals alike.

The third Green Expo is taking place this year in Chester with the prestigious Photo Competition already receiving entries, a Youth Conference at the University of Chester on June 14 and the exposition at the Innovation Zone in Grosvenor Park June 15-16 at Chester Green Weekend. The Awards Dinner will be held on November 14.

The Cheshire Energy Hub has been entirely funded and strategically driven by industry.

The energy sector support organisation is a multi-employer partnership between a number of leading international Cheshire based organisations based around Ellesmere Port near Chester.

One of the UK's largest industrial clusters, the area around Ellesmere Port consumes around 5% of the nation's energy and includes some of the UK's largest manufacturers.

Ged Barlow, CEO of Net Zero North West said; ""The Cheshire Energy Hub brought together network owners, innovators and partners, including EA Technology, Urenco, Peel NRE, Burns & McDonnell, BGS, Cadent, Engie, Storengy, Tata Chemicals, SP Energy Networks (SPEN), Encirc, ESSAR, the Cheshire & Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership, Cheshire West & Chester LA and the University of Chester.""

He added; ""Cheshire, and the North West, is a leader on the way to net-zero, involving more than £100m of capital investment and the creation of 33,000 jobs. We need to develop a skilled workforce through work with the University of Chester, local colleges and schools and recognise innovation.

""This is why we are supporting Green Expo with its Youth Conference in June and Awards in November.""

Green Expo is gathering information for a manifesto of questions, concerns and pledges from organisations and individuals to be submitted for the Global climate change conference, COP 29 in November.

The 91-point result was set up by a dominant first quarter from the Bulldogs where they dominated field position to open up a 23-point lead at the first break.

While the Tigers went into the game as underdogs, Kane Cornes was incredibly disappointed by their start as he felt they showed no pressure, effort or desire to bring the game to their opposition.

Cornes even pondered whether the now 1-8 Tigers have completely given up on their season and he expects things to only get worse from here if they continue putting in performances like they did on Saturday.

""It was ugly, it was a real precession,"" Cornes said on AFL.com.au's The Round So Far.

""The first quarter numbers in this game were alarming. They were plus 18 in disposals and 15 in inside 50s. It was 23 to eight inside 50s in this term which was a real issue for Richmond.

""I just wonder whether they've given up, the Tigers.

""It's a big thing to say and I know the personnel issues that they've got, but some of the vision that we saw with a lack of pressure, effort and any want to get after the opposition was a real concern.

""With such a long period to go for the rest of the season, I feel like it's only going to get uglier.

""This was against a Western Bulldogs side that hasn't been in good form, they were coming off a loss to a Hawthorn side that's bottom four last week.

""They were absolutely belted from stoppage and off turnover it was alarming how easily the Dogs were able to score.""

While the Dogs were dominant to win so convincingly, Cornes didn't think we learned much about Luke Beveridge's side given how poor Richmond was.

Cornes also wants to see Tigers coach Adem Yze ""get nasty"" with his playing group to spark them into action.

""What do we learn about the Western Bulldogs? Not much,"" Cornes said.

""Their next four weeks will become more of a learning experience for us. They have the Giants, Sydney, Collingwood and Brisbane.

How to move towards autonomy for your home - The Bobr Times","Installer des panneaux solaires sur son toit peut être un bon investissement, au-delà de l'aspect écologique. MAXPPP - Jean-Marc Lallemand

Il est difficile, encore aujourd'hui, de ne plus dépendre des réseaux. Mais on peut largement réduire ses consommations.

It is difficult, if not impossible, to make a home completely autonomous, in particular because legislation, since 2008, has prohibited the use of water falling from the sky for human consumption - which activists legally contest, especially since filtration techniques make it possible to make it potable.

There are, however, possibilities to reduce water consumption, for example by opting for dry toilets or by installing rainwater collectors (from 200 to 1,000 liters, prices vary widely ) which allow, at a minimum, to water your garden and vegetable patch or to wash your car, or even with more complex and buried systems, to power toilets and washing machines. It'is necessarily more expensive (sometimes beyond 5,000 €) but at a time when the resource is becoming scarce, it's virtuous.

Before getting started, however, you must ""examine the rainfall data of your municipality and the catchment area to calculate the collectable volume"", advises the Eau Douce collective. In our region, a roof of 100 m² can recover approximately 70 m3 of rainwater per year for an average individual need - including drinking water - of 54 m3. Not nothing, even if these calculations have unfortunately been less relevant in certain places for two years, notably in the Pyrénées-Orientales department which suffers from a precipitation deficit.

In the sky, however, there is another wealth that can help make your home less greedy: the sun. ""The Positive Energy Region strategy led by the Occitanie Region aims to halve energy consumption per inhabitant and cover 100% of the territory's energy needs with local renewable energies at the same time. ;horizon 2050. By renovating their property, everyone can be an actor"", often says the president of the Region Carole Delga.

This is all the more true since, thanks to the drop in production costs of electricity from renewable and photovoltaic sources in particular, self-consumption has become economically attractive. More than resale on the network ""at a price which tends to decrease each year, when the electricity bill increases"", adds Lukas Maurin of the local energy and climate agency (Alec) of Montpellier Métropole.

It is therefore advisable to opt for the principle of self-consumption, with resale of the surplus, because it is difficult to consume 100% of what we produce, even by installing storage batteries (from ;rsquo;a cost of approximately 3,000 €) ""rarely profitable"". ""Before embarking on such a project, you must carefully study your consumption profile"", warns Lukas Maurin, who points out the obvious: ""It's during the day and on sunny days that photovoltaics will produce the most electricity, but these are not necessarily the periods when electricity needs are greatest& ;quot;. However, we can modify these habits, in particular by programming certain appliances (dishwasher, washing machine) during the day.

Above all, you must be careful not to oversize your installation. Generally, 3 kWp is enough for a household "", assures Alec's expert. This represents, according to Engie, approximately 13 m² of panels on the roof for an average cost of 9,000 to 13,000 € depending on the choices made. We can hope to produce between 2,700 and 4,200 kWh/year, or approximately 40 to 60% of needs. And just as much saved on the electricity bill. The promised profitability oscillates ""from 10 to 15 years"" for a lifespan of solar panels which has increased in recent years, up to at 30 years old..

Between an eco-friendly gesture and long-term savings, the operation can be tempting. But, recalls Lukas Maurin, producing your energy, ""this is the last step, in individual housing as well as in co-ownership. The priority remains above all to reduce housing consumption.",bobrtimes.com,news,bobrtimes.com,,0.04313725490196085,453174792,1,,

Eduardo Takamori - CFO and IRO

Rafael Bosio - Manager for Investor Relations

Good morning, everybody. We are beginning the results of video conference for the First Quarter '24 for Engie Energy. I am Adriana Wagner, the IR Manager for the company, and I would like to make some announcements. [Operator Instructions] Please remember that this event is being recorded. The presentation is available at our site ng.com.br/ir.

We have the presentation, the results release and the income statement, everything that has been filed at the CDM. You will find details of our financial operations, the ESG advances in the presentation of new projects, among other relevant information. Before proceeding, please recall that the forward-looking statements made during this conference referring to the company's business prospects should be dealt with as forecast that depend on the macroeconomic situation of the country, of the electrical sector, besides other factors. They are, therefore, subject to change. Journalists who wish to pose questions can do so through e-mail, sending them to the press release group from the company.

Now to present the results for the first quarter '24 for Engie, we have Eduardo Takamori, CFO and IRO; and Rafael Bosio, the Manager for Investor Relations.

I now turn the floor over to Eduardo Takamori. You may proceed.

Eduardo Takamori

Well, thank you, Adriana. Thank you all for your participation. If you could confirm how many we are?

Well, thank you all for your participation. Before beginning the presentation. I would like to speak about Rio Grande do Sul. Engie has been present there for 25 years since our privatization. We are deeply connected to the state. We offer our solidarity to the families, the people affected as well as the companies in the region. Unfortunately, the problem is not over. There is a forecast for more rainfalls. And of course, they will require a great deal of help.

On our part, the message to them is that Engie as well as other companies of the group are acting directly to work on a campaign where we're going to ask our associates to offer resources as this is an emergency period and we will be continuing to contribute until this emergency is over. So we're asking each and every one of you to please also do your part, help not only the official authorities of the scale, but also ask your partners, friends and communities to do the same.

It is important for everybody to do the same, not only feel solidarity, but truly help. Regarding our assets, we are in the state since 1998. We began with Passo Fundo and other assets, which we no longer have. They have been disinvested or otherwise, but we also have resources that are on the border between Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. None of our assets have been impacted or presents risk at this moment. Of course, they are under observation. Passo Fundo that could have easily been affected, did have some problems during the week. It required special attention, but nothing that requires extraordinary actions.

We're simply carrying out a very close observation with a focus on the reservoir to ensure the security of people in the entire region. I reinforce, therefore, that each person should do their part to reduce or minimize this terrible impact. Very well, we will go on through the highlights of the first quarter. And before I refer to these highlights, I would like to mention that the first quarter tends to be somewhat calmer for everybody compared to the rest of the year.

But this quarter reflects a mono of transition in Engie Energy. I would like to underscore this now, why? Now we did the closing of the partial sale of our stake in TAG, we sold 15%.

We remain with 17.5% of the share capital, as you can see to the left. This happened in January. And all of the results of the first quarter will be impacted by the results, the proceeds of the sale of TAG and also because of the lower contribution of the asset. And you will see that this expense throughout the presentation.

A second relevant part was the acquisition of Juazeiro, Sao Pedro, Sol do Futuro, Sertao Solar and Lar do Sol, 5 photovoltaic complexes. The closing was done at the end of the quarter in March. And so the results are still not very evident, and you will see the results evolving through the coming quarters. But the energy is in line with our strategy for growth. In the third part, the Fitch ratings reaffirming the long-term national rating of AAA.

Of course, it is very propitious. It enables us to resolve our debt in a very competitive way, reducing the cost of capital. And of course, we have benefited from this through time. And the fourth is simply to communicate to you the AGM approval of the distribution of mandatory and complementary dividends for the year 2023 in the amount of BRL994.5 million, almost BRL1 billion. These shares will be traded ex-dividend as of May 7, and payment will be carried out at the end of July.

In the next slide, we already see the economic financial impacts of the events that we have just mentioned. The EBITDA had a jump of BRL2 million to BRL3.16 million. You can observe that an expressive part of that part, 53% came from the net result of the partial disinvestments of TAG, BRL1.35 million referring to that net results.

Now when we remove this result of disinvestment, we see a drop of 12% in our adjusted EBITDA. It's not really the adjusted EBITDA because you will observe that we still require the IFRS adjustment, the cost of transmission adjustments. But if we think only of the exclusive impact of TAG, this is the drop that we see, 12%.

Another reason for the reduction of EBITDA quarter-on-quarter is the exit of Pampa Sul. This was sold out in the second half of last year. And of course, this will impact our EBITDA. If we add both of these, you will see that a great part of this negative variation of 12% can be justified by these 2 movements. We did have other movements, the higher result of the CEE, the trading company, but we can thus mainly characterize this variation of EBITDA because of TAG and the sale of Passo and so we practically doubled our net revenues.

Now we had BRL891 million, which is an expressive profit for the quarter, higher than the profit, almost twofold of BRL793 million for the quarter. But of course, if you assess that from the yearly viewpoint, it will tend to be lower, more relative. And this will not continue on as it is a non-recurrent element, and it helps us in the net revenue, the net income, the proceeds of that sale enable us to deliver our CapEx, which was truly expressive, as you will see further on.

In net income, we had the contribution of EBITDA of BRL249 million, as you can observe below to the right of the presentation. And this was integrally neutralized by a very positive financial result, minus financial costs. 80% of our debt is indexed to the IPCA, and when the IPCA tends to get weaker or below in the semester of '23, you end up having financial costs. And a more expressive cash production during the quarter because of the proceeds of TAG that were used merely at the end of the quarter when we took on the Atlas acquisition.

In the next slide, you can already see our ESG KPIs strongly influenced in the top left, as you can see by the total emissions and emissions intensity, both of which have been drastically reduced because of the exit of Pampa Sul in our portfolio. These are Scope 3 emissions. We have done our homework. We have worked with Scope 1, Scope 2 as well. And in fact, we can now work with education, convincing and monitoring of our entire chain of supply.

We have, in terms of health and safety, we had a very good evolution. Our frequency rate used to be 0.4. It has dropped to 0.05, an expressive drop. With health and safety among our associates at the top once again, the percentage of women in the workforce was an evolution. And I think this has been perceived throughout the quarters as you may have observed. Our group of women went from 26.9%, reaching almost 30% throughout the 4 quarters that we're showing you here and the percentage of women and leaders, their positions went from 23% to almost 28%, of course, an extremely satisfactory result in our strategy here.

In the bottom chart, investments in innovation with a reduction [indiscernible] because of the disinvestment of Pampa Sul in our portfolio. We continue to invest in research and development very strongly. We're investing in social responsibility that shows a significant growth of 2.0% to 2.5% in the last few quarters. And in terms of people engaged community relationship programs, more than 14,000 and some people who are working in partnership with us.

For the end of the ESG highlights, we would like to recommend that you all visit our sustainability report 2023. The excellent work, it's an important management tool for rendering accountability to stakeholders. We're working with a global reporting initiative, GRI, and the Bureau Veritas assurance. You can access our sustainability report that is on our slide as well.

Very well. Rafael will speak about our energy sales at this point.

Rafael Bosio

Our commercial strategy, very good. We have some good news coming from the commercial area. As always, our commercial strategy is working with the gradual sale of our commercial capacity in that quest for more favorable prices and windows of opportunity. And this is precisely what happened in the fourth quarter '23 and in the first quarter, '24 when we had greater price volatility, we were able to contract a significant volume of future energy for the years '26, '27, '28. We have attempted to speed up the sale of those positions.

If you compare the figures, we have reported a de-contracting in the last quarter. You will observe that there has been this acceleration as of the third quarter. For example, in uncontracted energy till '28 at the third quarter of '23, we went from 41% to 30% now in the first quarter '24. We also identified good drop, positive drops for the years of '27 and others. And this shows that in truth, we are putting this strategy in practice.

We're attempting to capture these moments of greater sales in the market as happened in the fourth quarter of '23, first quarter of this year, and this values our portfolio. All of this, thanks to that flexibility adopted of not being forced to contract because you have a long position during a specific period.

Another point I would like to highlight, if you look at the graph to the left, the graph already consider the assets of Atlas that have begun to be part of our portfolio as of March of this year. And we have a better breakdown of our energy balance in the attachment on slide 35, where you can clearly identify that from the years '24 to '29, we have carried out average sales of 160 megawatts month, a very relevant factor for the quarter.

Next slide, please [indiscernible]. We show you once again that we're still capturing those clients that are migrating from the regulated environment to the free contracting environment. We had a very good representation this quarter. Since the first quarter, the smaller customers connected to high power, began to have that possibility of migrating. We had almost 47% in the annual comparison.

It's important because in portfolio, these clients will become loyal, they will generate value and with a potentially lower cost of capturing these customers, it's better to capture the migration now than to have to do it later and take them from another player in the market.

In the next slide, we begin to speak about expansion. We update you on the progress of the implementation of new products. The first is the Santo Agostinho Wind Complex. This slide is something that you will see for the last time in the presentation because Santo Agostinho is fully operational. It's at 99.6% progress, only two aero generators are still not operational. They had incidents with their blades, but this will be made regular during the second quarter. And so we consider the Santo Agostinho Wind Complexes being fully operational.

Next slide, we also identified strides in the implementation of Serra do Assurua in the fourth quarter '23, the event. The progress was 31%. We're now at 45%. So we're moving along within the financial and physical schedule with the estimates that in the third quarter of '24, we will begin operations.

You can see in the picture, the first wind turbines that have had their assembly concluded as expected. And we have the goal, the expectation that the full delivery will be reached until the end of the coming year. We also see this in the next slide with the Assu Sol Photovoltaic Complex, it should be concluded the coming year with the beginning of operations in the fourth quarter of this year. We have two large projects that are being simultaneously implemented with coming into delivery simultaneously.

As we saw with Assu, there is a significant advance in the fourth quarter. When it comes to implementation activities, we had 18.6% progress at present. We were at 8% in the fourth quarter. So everything going on track and as planned, enabling us to add this installed capacity of renewable sources in our portfolio.

Next slide, please, [indiscernible]. Here, we go on to transmission, another slide that will appear for the last time in the presentation. Gaviao Real that in July will attain commercial operation. It's an operation of the substation side to side with our transmission system of Estado that has been in full operation since February of last year. Now to continue in transmission in the next slide, we're speaking of a more relevant project, the Asa Branca transmission of energy. We were successful in the auction in July of last year.

We obtained the prior licenses in the first quarter of this year, and we continue with a forecast of anticipating the coming into delivery by at least 24 months, which will leverage the return on this project.

Next slide, we continue to observe excellent operational results from the Jirau Hydroelectric Plant. The Engie Group has a stake of 44%. At this point, it's not a stake of Engie Energy, and we're still awaiting for opportunities to, for the transfer of this asset from the controller to ourselves, but there have been no novelties on that front since we convert the last time on the fourth quarter '23 results call very well. This is the last slide for the expansion.

We have made some changes on this slide to end the session with what is something of a summary to the left. A list of the projects that are still under construction, Santo Agostinho, Serra do Assurua, Gaviao Real and Asa Branca and to the right, projects under development that are in our portfolio and are awaiting better commercial conditions specifically to then undergo the construction.

These projects are not under construction contrary to what you see to the left. And that it is important to have a consistent portfolio, and commercial conditions could be resumed very quickly, and we have to be ready to leverage the return of these projects.

Very well with this, I would like to end this session on expansion, and I return the floor to Eduardo Takamori.

Eduardo Takamori

Thank you. We're going to now speak about the financial results, the evolution of ROI and ROI, a reduction of 32.5% to 28.3% in ROI for the first quarter. ROIC also with a slight reduction of 20% to 18% natural because of the higher leverage of the company, something that was expected to the right of the slide. We go back to our recent background of investments, reaching BRL28.5 billion, enabling us to go from a sub leverage. We are now at 2.3x, and we will reinforce this further ahead half of our capacity and with room for investment in our plant.

And we have carried out a very, well, here in the pie chart, our company was a 100% energy generation, but we have found new flows. We have diversified our portfolio. You will see that this pie chart will return with those ranges of this 20% in the coming years. Of course, we're working with renewable asset going into Assurua and Sao and also Atlas, which will change these pies and maintain the diversification.

Now all of the blend of the portfolio enables us to have quite a bit of forecast ability when it comes to adjusted EBITDA and much more in the next slide. We're looking at the net operating revenue change, a reduction of BRL2.9 million from the last quarter to BRL2.6 million this quarter and the top-line, a strong influence because of the lack of contribution, of course, of Pampa Sul.

In the second part, the hydro situation, which has helped us with our strategy, helping to offset the frustration in generation by our wind mills that were suffering along with everybody else. We were able to absorb this problem in a way that was somewhat less painful than our peers in the market.

In trading, minus BRL47 million, a reduction of revenue in trading, but this does not present any specific contract indication. We did have a reduction of contribution of BRL73 million because of the remuneration of contracts and construction of assets. We did not receive a contribution from construction that was still taking place in the first quarter of last year of BRL3 million, and that is why we have the consequent reduction, nothing atypical or outside of what would have been expected.

In the next slide, simply a way to reach the EBITDA, the result of equity income and we'd like to present the results of TAG in this quarter. We went from BRL2.2 billion and a total profit of BRL841 million. As we presently have a lower stake in TAG, this will also lead to a reduced EBITDA. The specific contribution was BRL600 and some million this quarter, BRL162 million.

Very well, here is our EBITDA change. Now this slide has several columns. Perhaps we will reduce the number of columns in the future, but it does help us to share our story this quarter. EBITDA without any adjustment to reflect the effective situation of the country, BRL2.06 billion in the first quarter '23. It jumped to BRL3.165 billion this quarter, but BRL162 billion, of course, are the proceeds from the sale, the sale of TAG, our stake in TAG.

Now if we look at this without the TAG operation, we have a variation of BRL2.6 billion to BRL1.18 billion, a reduction of 2%, as I had mentioned. And then we work with the IFRS adjustments for transmission for shareholders, and we can focus on the central column that went from BRL1.825 billion to BRL1.79 billion, a variation of BRL156 million, equivalent to a reduction of 8%. This BRL150 million can be justified by the disinvestment in Pampa.

As mentioned, in the central bars, we have 116. We bought less energy from third parties, a reduction in portfolio. The third bar, although we were very successful in contracting, this was done at a slightly lower sales price.

So we have a lower number of sales. Technically, the fourth bar is an operation, a higher result at the CCEE influenced by our strategy that offsets our generation of the wind assets and I highlight charges and royalties. Basically, here, we have the entry of the Atlas assets into our portfolio. And when you bring in new assets, of course, you have additional cost to pay for, which is expected for and a higher payment royalties because of the performance of our assets.

You can take a look at the transmission bar, another additional BRL37 million. Because of the entry of assets, we have a higher rep. And this is what we are observing here. And then the equity income from tax with a comparative reduction vis-a-vis the former quarter, which fully justifies these variations, a negative variation compared to other quarters.

Next slide, please. We're finally getting to the net income change as presented in the first slide. It went from BRL882 million to BRL1.684 billion. More than half of that profit from the quarter is due to TAG. If we observe this ex TAG sales, a reduction of 10% in our net income strongly influenced by the variation of EBITDA neutralized by a very positive financial results in the quarter, as we explained at the beginning.

In this next slide, we show you our indebtedness balanced debt. We have gone back to the levels of 2022. The end of the year, we had a net debt over EBITDA of 2.1x. Now this figure increased to 2.3x. And we remind you that throughout that period, we went from BRL21 billion to BRL22 billion of net debt.

Now we now have the Atlas assets, and we're in the process of leveraging to be able to face our CapEx schedule, not only for this year but for the year 2025. So we have BRL5.2 billion for cash and equivalents, quite equivalent to what we had in the past. We had a higher cash and equivalents between the period of receiving the revenues from TAG at the beginning of the quarter and the payment of Atlas, which happened at the end of the quarter. And so you will see this higher cash burn and part of this cash will be consumed during the year, of course, through investment.

In the next slide, our debt profile and composition quite compatible with our cash generation. No specific highlight in terms of our profile. It's simply worthwhile highlighting that the average debt term is quite long of 7.5 years. We also have a debt with the national development bank, the BNDES, which is of great help. And our cost of our net debt tends to be ever more pegged to the IPCA. So, very gradually, we're denominating our debt principally in the IPCA and the nominal cost of debt of 9.2% per year.

In the next slide, and in line with what we have mentioned in the last quarters, our investment volume is quite robust this year, well, almost BRL10 billion. And part of this has already materialized as you may have observed in the last communicate that we carried out, BRL2.5 billion from this amount of BRL9.5 billion, BRL7.2 billion. 9.6 billion minus 2.4 billion gives us 7.2 billion. Of the 7.2 billion, part of this has already been addressed in the first quarter.

So our disbursement profile, our investment profile is fully on track as expected. And it is fully compatible with our partial sale of TAG and our, the debt that we took in the fourth quarter totaling BRL2.5 billion as well with the debentures that we issued at the end of the year.

Now with these two elements, the sale of TAG and the issuance of debentures, we will be able to address practically 50% of our commitments with CapEx. Now we will go to the market more times the year, more than had been expected. We do have room for leveraging as you were able to observe a few slides again, so we're resorting to the market again to maximize our capital structure.

In the next slide, our dividend, you'll see the last 10 years. And you can see that we have paid out a 100% of the dividend. Dividends tend to be at the level of 6%, 7%, 8%. They did hit 8% in 2022, a reduction to 5.7%. And we continue to maintain a level very close to 6%, paying out 55%. It's natural, therefore, that this year, in the coming year, we will continue to prefer to maintain part of the profit of the dividends in-house to be able to carry out our investments and to maximize our capital structure. Well, we know that shareholders prefer to receive dividends, but we will have a better custody of it in-house instead of paying it out in integrally and wholly.

I believe that it was the last slide of the presentation and we can now go on to the question-and-answer session.

We thank you, Taka and Rafael. We will now go on to the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Fillipe Andrade, an analyst from Itau BBAa. He has 2 questions. First, up to this point, which has been the performance of the wind assets of the company in generation and which has been the price dynamic of prices for the longer term, '25, '26? We saw that the company sold relevant volume in '27 going forward. If you could share more details in terms of the average price of those transactions?

Eduardo Takamori

I will answer the first part. You answer the second [indiscernible]. Now the performance of wind assets was very much in line with the market. We had a combination of external factors. Yes, we did face frustration. Our assets generated 30% below expectations. And the accrued value, we had new assets coming into operation like Santo Agostinho, we had 20% less in terms of wind generation.

We did feel that, and I go back to what I said before, despite that impact on the part of our wind assets, we did have synergy on the part of our electro-energy and a good allocation of energy, which proved to be very timely at that specific moment. We were able to show the resilience of our portfolio through this.

Rafael Bosio

Now Taka, simply to complement this, if you look at the previous quarters, we were performing better than our peers in wind generation. We have a concentration of our parks in the hinterlands of Bahia where the winds were still performing as expected. That did not happen in the first quarter. There was heavy rainfall in the Northeast throughout the entire region despite having a somewhat different profile and most of our assets are not on the coast of the Northeast. We were not able to come out untouched by this seasonal low wind.

Now the wonder of having a diversified portfolio is that in electrical generation and in the allocation of these assets, we were able to mitigate our drop. The results at the CCEE were still superior vis-a-vis last year. Isn't that correct? Yes, well put. Now when it comes to prices, you know that we cannot disclose our sales prices, especially in the free market in the regulated market.

You can see this in the attachment of the presentation. But in the free markets, there is a confidentiality clause not to disclose these amounts. It could compromise our sales strategy vis-a-vis competitors and clients. Now if we look at what the quarter was like and the CID curve at the end of March, the price of incentivized energy reached BRL190, conventional energy, a 150 prices. This is the reference that we can offer you.

We were at a level very close to that, but we cannot poorly disclose our amount. And Adriana, I am anticipating the next question from Soza, who has asked for more details on price. But we do have our hands tied somewhat, and this is a reference we can offer you. What do you think Takamori?

Eduardo Takamori

I'm sorry I were thinking of something, a characteristic that you mentioned that we take the most of the opportunity of having higher prices in the fourth quarter. Last year, we accelerated the sales of '27, '28. This will be complemented during our quarter. And well, we can't think about average costs or prices for 2026. Now volatility is the new method of the Brazilian energy matrix.

The situation is very different from the past, where we had greater clarity of the price in coming months because of the present day situation, we have an excess of supply and expressive excess. But if we have more or less rainfall, greater or lesser demand and solar and wind energy generation, we could have a better price at the end of the year. In fact, it's no longer a floor as we imagine that the, in mid last year, that doesn't exist anymore and it depends on the frustration or postergation of the coming periods, all generators are giving a price to this risk and we have to not only see which will be the probable value, but which will be the dispersion and the probability of occurrence of this scenario.

And it seems that until last year, the generators, the entire market thought that the probability of occurring this would be contained within the history of the last decades. What we have perceived is that because of climate change and the price of our matrix, this can go beyond the limit we observed last year, the ENA, more extreme scenarios than we had last year.

And naturally, this means we will have an aversion to risk. And if you have risk aversion, the situation will be completely different from the past. Simply to justify what apparently seems to be the erratic movement of the market in the last quarter or overly conservative movement, this should have a new reading and should be understood as a new perception of what could evolve in the future.

Adriana Wagner

Perhaps this is not well understood and simply to clarify this. Our next question comes from Joao Fagundes from Bradesco. The question is, we have seen significant strides since 2023 on the part of the OMF park to restrict solar parks. Now some of the assets of Engie were impacted because of the documents of the ONS. Which is your vision of these assets for the first quarter and the rest of the year 2024?

Eduardo Takamori

Well, historically, we have followed up on our assets. And yes, we have seen the entry of new assets, such as the Atlas operations. We are monitoring the expectation for those new assets. These are solar assets. And in the region, we had wind assets that were somewhat different, and we do see a very good performance of these projects, and we're assessing that for the future. And we have good expectations for the year 2024.

But yes, they were more affected in the recent past. We remind you that we have just taken on these assets. We're still digesting the information if this can be said, and we remind you, Taka that to have a diversified portfolio with different sources, the ability to have a more seasonal energy in a differentiated way will serve as protection at moments where we have low generation. If this were not the case, we would have to go to the market to purchase energy to comply with our contracts.

Adriana Wagner

A complement of Andre Sampaio from Santander regarding the question that was asked, which is the expectation of curtailment in the long term for renewable energy?

Eduardo Takamori

Very good question. Our vision here for some time already is that this curtailment is here to stay. We imagine this would be due only to the restrictions for transmission in the Northeast. But for some time, we have come to realize that it's not only an issue of retransmission but the capacity of the load to absorb the solar and wind energy, especially solar energy. We're speaking here not only a centralized solar and wind energy, we have an expressive amount that entered our system in the last years, perhaps in a hyperbolic fashion. Because of the subsidies we have tried to warn on this distribution policy. But unfortunately, we're not successful.

So this curtailment, especially in solar energy is the direct impact of these policies that have remained for more time that they should have. And even in the medium term, we will continue to achieve this containment on weekends when the load tends to be lower. So it's here to stay for some years. And we remind you that this information, this perception had already been expressed by the teams during the acquisition of Atlas and the investment in solar energy. We've had this perception for some time already.

Adriana Wagner

The next question comes from Henrique Peretti, an analyst at JPMorgan regarding the greenfield projects that are awaiting better market conditions. What are you waiting for to start up with the projects? The perception is that price will continue to fluctuate on an annual base.

Eduardo Takamori

Henrique, I think it's all a matter of priority. If you follow-up on our operation, we are about to implement several projects. We're releveraging the company. And of course, it would not be the right time to increase our exposure of uncontracted energy. We do have other priorities. So this year, the focus is to deliver Assurua Wind itself in accordance with the CapEx and the quality of the programs that we have, and this will guarantee the acceptance of our shareholders.

We do monitor M&A opportunities in the market constantly. If anything interesting comes in, we have an eye on this, but we do want to create value and respect the minimum return, our indebtedness profile. So we tend to act somewhat more on the state side instead of making higher investments at this point. Henrique, we're part of a global group that has that audacious goal of getting to 30 gigawatts of renewable energy.

Engie is already making its contribution through Santo Agostinho, Assurua Wind itself. We have no strategic need to delve into a greenfield project at this moment. Of course, if there is an opportunity of uncontracted energy, we will observe it and perhaps think of carrying out a project in the short term.

For the rest, we continue with our mission of working with a 100% renewable energy with good quality and contracting this with greater ease to bring in income and leave some energy for the timely opportunities. But to summarize, this is not the time to begin working on a new front.

Adriana Wagner

Well, thank you. At this point, we would like to end the list of questions. We reinforce that the IR team of the company is at your entire disposal should you have further questions. I would like to return the floor to Rafael and Takamori for their closing remarks.

Eduardo Takamori

Well, thank you. Thank you. I reinforce what Adriana said. The IR area is at your entire disposal, should you have more questions. Once again, thank you for your attendance. We reached more than 215 participants during the call. Thank you for your interest, for your attendance and for those who connected in the middle of the call.

What I said first was to contribute directly towards minimizing the impacts of the tragedy of the severe flooding in Rio Grande do Sul. There are several official channels to do this. And we should act with our close groups, our friends and companies and also attempt to contribute to minimize the problem. Please take sides and act now.

Adriana Wagner

It has concluded that these fees are legitimate.

The authority said the ""terugleverkosten"" fees depend on higher purchasing costs, higher imbalance costs, and the net-metering costs that the energy suppliers have to deal with when their customers own and operate rooftop PV systems.

It added that the fees are not a source of profits, as the funds collected with them compensate the lower tariffs paid to consumers who do not own PV installations.

The competition regulator also said that PV system owners currently have to deal with complicated contracts offered by the energy suppliers, which makes it difficult to compare them and choose the best option.

""The ACM calls on suppliers and energy comparators to make efforts to improve the comparability of contracts,"" the authority said in a statement.

According to www.keuze.nl, a Dutch online platform that allows consumers to compare commercial offers of different kinds, the grid fees could vary between €100 ($107.81) and €697, depending on system size.

The Dutch solar market gained 4.82 GW of new PV capacity in 2023, according to the ""Nationaal Solar Trendrapport 2023"" study, which was recently published by consultancy Dutch New Energy (DNE) Research.

Spudding of the gas well is expected to occur next week, subject to rig acceptance and weather conditions.

Odin-2 is located 1.1 kilometres north-east of the Odin-1 appraisal well that commenced gas production in September.

The well is feeding the Pelican Point power station in South Australia under a sales agreement that extends to December 2026.

Pelican is a joint venture between Engie Services Australia and New Zealand (72% equity) and Mitsui Group (28%).

If drilling is successful, Vintage expects to complete and connect Odin-2 to Pelican Point, with gas being sold to the power station under the existing contract.

The Odin field has become a flagship asset for Vintage and contributed to a 96% in sales revenue for the company for the three months to December.

The addition of production from the Odin-1 well saw the company increase its gas output by 60% for the same period.

The company said Odin-1 had performed ""steadily and strongly"" since coming onstream, reinforcing the field's potential.

Odin-1 and Odin-2 sit within the ATP 2021 joint venture (JV) in which Vintage holds 50% equity alongside Metgasco (ASX: MEL) and Bridgeport (Cooper Basin), each of which owns 25%.

The wells are located in production licence PRL 211, which also contains the western part of the Odin field discovered by the same JV partners in 2021.

The eastern portion of the field is mapped to extend into ATP 2021.

In March, Vintage completed an $8 million capital raising to help bring in new gas production from the Odin field.

The raising was comprised of a $1.3m private placement to institutional investors and a $6.7m accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer.

In April, Vintage signed a farm-out agreement with Sabre Energy whereby Sabre will acquire a 50% interest in the PEL 679 exploration licence, also in the Cooper Basin.

Under the terms, Sabre will fund a 150 square kilometre 3D seismic survey and pay Vintage $200,000 as reimbursement of its share of costs incurred to the time the permit is granted.

Comprising a total area of 393 sq km, PEL 679 is located on the western flank of the basin, south-west of the Worrior field owned by Bass Oil (ASX: BAS).

The field has produced more than 4.5 million barrels of oil since production commenced in December 2003.",smallcaps.com.au,news,Small Caps,Imelda Cotton,0.3725490196078431,452916655,1,https://smallcapsau.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Vintage-Energy-ASX-VEN-Odin-2-rig-spudding.jpg,

Egypt is preparing to become one of Africa's leaders in wind energy. To achieve this, Cairo will be relying primarily on private investment. As part of this strategy, the New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) has just granted land for two projects led by private companies.

The signing ceremony took place recently in the presence of Mohamed Shaker, Egypt's Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, and Hilde Klemetsdal, Norway's Ambassador to Egypt. Together with Scatec, NREA Chairman Mohamed El-Khayat signed the land permit for the development of 5 GW of wind power generation capacity. Egypt's flagship Orascam Construction has signed a contract for 3 GW of wind power, which it will develop as part of a consortium that also includes French energy company Engie and Japan's Eurus Energy.

These two projects could inject a combined capacity of 8 GW into the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) grid. According to NREA, the two projects, which represent an investment of $9 billion, will also offset the emissions of 17 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year.

It marks the days since her cousin was taken hostage by Hamas.

Dariel campaigns almost daily with her mother Rebecca, demanding a deal to bring the dozens of Israelis seized by Hamas during the group's Oct. 7 terrorist attack back home. But it hasn't been easy.

In the days immediately after the attack, Rebecca thought her daughter needed help.

""I spoke with her teacher right away, and we agreed that she should meet with the school counselor -- and the school counselor is Arab, and I don't know her,"" recalled the mother. ""Is that complicated? Will it be complicated?""

Dariel goes to one of only six schools in Israel that is not segregated into Arab and Jewish students.

""That night, the school counselor wrote to me,"" recalled Rebecca. ""She said: ""My heart is with you.'""

""It was like this wave of feeling felt and heard and seen, and completely secure and confident,"" she said.

At the Hand in Hand school in Jerusalem, children learn both Arabic and Hebrew. History is taught by two teachers -- one Jewish and one Palestinian.

Hanin Dabash also sends her children to the school. She told CBS News it gives them ""the opportunity to say what they think -- to talk about their fears, their future, their misunderstanding of what is happening... I think the kids are normalized to listen to each other.""

""We have family members of students in Gaza that were killed. We have teachers that send their children to the army in Gaza,"" said Principal Efrat Meyer. ""And we pay attention to everyone.""

Meyer, who is Jewish, is in charge of the remarkable experiment. She told CBS News that the laser focus on simply listening to one another stems from several core goals.

""We want our students first not to be racists,"" she said. ""To acknowledge the different histories and the sufferings of both cultures, and we know that students that graduate from here behave differently in society later.""

To get them to that point, no topic can be taboo.

""We talk about our fear,"" explained Deputy Principal Engie Wattad, ""and when we see the other side understanding and putting themselves in our shoes... it's deeply comforting.""

For students like Dariel, that means having difficult conversations.

""I've learned that it's hard for us to speak, because a lot of us are scared to share our thoughts,"" she admitted. ""But we need to.""

Principal Meyer doesn't attempt to portray her school's work -- or any aspect of life in the heart of the troubled Middle East -- as easy, but she said it helps to know that she and her colleagues are working to create a brighter future.

""The situation in Israel, it's not easy,"" she said. ""I think that it's easier when you know that you are part of the solution... It's easier that you know that what you do now affects the lives and souls of students. It's easier when you talk about it, when you expand your knowledge. I find it harder to be outside of this school right now.""

She knows peace may be far away for her country and for all of her students and their families. But they are prepared.

""When peace will be here, for us, it's not going to be a big change,"" Meyer said. ""We have the skills, we practice it. We'll be able to teach other people how to do it.""

Until then, she and her colleagues at Hand in Hand will continue arming their students with a weapon more powerful than guns or bombs: Empathy.",cbsnews.com,news,CBS News,,-0.0980392156862745,452874672,1,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/08/318044c8-947a-4afc-a29c-f994b1c1d349/thumbnail/1200x630/985997081e75332031559e8d4f6a0722/hand-in-hand-school-class-1.jpg?v=3a71db5e6dd1c027f95668a1c7b6fcaf,

MIAMI and HOUSTON, May 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Institute of Contemporary Art Miami (ICA) and a subsidiary of ENGIE North America (ENGIE) announced today an innovative new collaboration that advances an emerging renewable energy solution and expands the museum's sustainability efforts. Under the terms of a five-year agreement with ENGIE Resources LLC, ICA Miami will procure Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from ENGIE's Priddy Wind Project (Mills County, Texas) to match 100% of the museum's forecast electricity consumption. As the first renewable energy agreement in Florida for ENGIE Resources, the collaboration represents increasing interest for similar solutions in markets that are not yet open to retail power competition.

A leading contemporary art museum in the U.S. and globally, ICA Miami is recognized for promoting continuous experimentation and embracing innovative practices, through its exhibitions and programs and in its operations and practices. In 2020, the museum was among the original grantees for the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation's sustainability funding and has since implemented carbon offsets and sustainable shipping practices for major exhibitions. With this energy agreement, ICA Miami is matching 100% of its electricity consumption for the building and museum operations with project-specific Green-e® certified RECs that avoid the greenhouse gas emissions of 1,352 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.*

Commercial and industrial customers from any market can support sustainability efforts by sourcing project-specific RECs, but interest is in its early stages. ""Customer understanding and adoption of RECs takes time,"" said Brad McIntyre, business development manager at ENGIE Resources. ""ICA Miami is a great jumping-off point for us in the South Florida market,"" said McIntyre. ""RECs provide sustainable solutions for developers to invest in new assets and we expect this agreement to accelerate the impact of renewables in this and other similar markets.""

""ICA Miami has long been committed to adopting best practices for sustainability and reducing the museum's carbon footprint. Our alliance with ENGIE not only supports the museum's ongoing sustainability efforts, but also contributes to an emerging renewable energy solution that is not yet prevalent in South Florida. We are excited to be a part of bringing these kinds of solutions to our community and to continue expanding on this work,"" said Alex Gartenfeld, ICA Miami Irma and Norman Braman artistic director.

Acting as an advisor on the agreement is Industrial Energy (Fort Lauderdale, FL). ""It is exciting to be at the forefront of a solution that promotes planet-friendly power in a market that is not yet open to retail choice,"" said Christian Amabile, executive vice president. It's a privilege to work with an organization that plays such an important role in the social landscape.""

Green-e® RECs are certified by the nonprofit Center for Resource Solutions. Certification ensures that RECs are properly accounted for and that no double counting takes place.

A growing number of companies are encouraging their employees to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams in-house - a trend known as intrapreneurship. Some managers do this by providing workers with the financial, human and material resources required for innovation. For example, Google has long encouraged employees to devote 20% of their working hours to side projects unrelated to their daily jobs. Others firms unleash workplace creativity by clearly stating the types of innovations they're after.

Encouraging measured risks

Another less obvious and yet potentially game-changing method consists in tolerating, if not celebrating, failure. It's common sense that rewards can act as ""carrots"" to encourage intrapreneurship - a concept we associate with success. But what if failure were just as important?

To create an organisational culture that encourages an innovative intrapreneurial process, tolerating failure can be a first step. This can encourage employees to be more confidence and to take measured risks - provided that this tolerance is made explicit to employees.

It's also about encouraging the idea that learning can come from failure. Every stumble can be transformed into an opportunity because it led to the discovery of new problems or different perspectives. An intrapreneur faced with an impasse acquires knowledge that she or he would not otherwise have been able to obtain. If someone else took over the project, they wouldn't have been exposed to the same challenges, nor have the same learning as the original person.

Pitching a failure

It is possible to go even further. In a case study on the French energy company Engie, we looked at their decision to give ""best failed ideas"" awards to employees who dared - and failed - to realize their innovative ideas.

We analysed how Engie began to consider failed projects, not just to show a form of tolerance, but also to promote them within the company so that everyone can learn from them.

Despite being based on good ideas, some projects end up failing. They can be seen as quasi-successes, however, because sometimes it's the company that decides to call them to an end. These are neither failures nor successes. Instead, they're near-successes, also known as ""nearlings"". These projects did not achieve the desired results for the firm, particularly in terms of profitability, but when carried out rigorously, they provided learning opportunities for the whole company.

The energy giant has taken up the original idea of creating a category within its ""innovation trophies"" called ""best failed idea"". The practice was already popularised by Ratan Tata, head of a major Indian industrial group. It was an initiative by the company's innovation manager to reward the best ideas that had ""failed"", and the group experimented with the scheme from 2016 to 2020.

The selection procedure was not the same as for the other trophy categories, where project leaders apply spontaneously. Instead, the group's innovation director canvassed candidates directly, acknowledging that presenting a failure was not easy.

The eventual winner of the ""best failed idea"" prize had a project whose development potential the company doubted and thus wasn't financed. In a three-minute pitch, he was able to highlight what he had learned from the process, and the jury found his perseverance convincing. One of the members of the jury, a senior executive in the group, invited him to a private meeting - he had the intuition that while the idea had not been retained in its original context, it could be of use to his product line. Without this trophy category, the director would probably never have heard of the project.

""Best Nearling""

And what if this type of initiative were to become widespread? These approaches to rewarding failure, which go beyond simply celebrating mistakes, are being deployed by large companies such as Google, Australia's MacQuarie Telecom, the US accounting firm Intuit, the chemical firm Huntsman and the textile giant WLGore. Perhaps the name could be changed to ""Best Nearling"" to reassure employees who are reluctant to tell top management that they have failed, even if for the right reasons.",theconversation.com,news,The Conversation,,0.4588235294117646,452779450,6,https://images.theconversation.com/files/592226/original/file-20240327-18-cu1qya.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=16%2C0%2C5118%2C2559&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,

Under the PPA, CTA supplies 1,000 GWh of electricity to Codelco's Gabriel Mistral Division mine and part of the Chuquicamata mine until 2032. Among the modified terms is the switch from coal to renewables from January 1, 2026.

It was this revised PPA that enabled Codelco to reach the goal of 100% green electricity before 2030.

Cerilon's facility will be the first of its kind globally to utilize large-scale carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology. This cutting-edge approach aims to minimize the project's environmental footprint.

The GTL plant will transform natural gas into approximately 24,000 barrels daily of high-quality synthetic products, including advanced lubricants, ultra-low sulfur diesel, and naphtha.

Notably, the project will establish a domestic source for Group III+ base oils, which are currently primarily imported.

Worley plans to leverage a standardized design approach for this project, enabling efficient replication in the future.

The company considers this contract ""sustainable work"" according to its internal classification system.

Worley has already completed the preliminary engineering phase (pre-FEED) for the GTL project.

This new agreement signifies the official start of the FEED stage. The engineering services will be delivered from Worley's Calgary office, Canada, with additional support from their global network, including integrated delivery teams.

""We look forward to continuing to support Cerilon as they produce lower carbon products and energy, consistent with our purpose of delivering a more sustainable world,"" commented Chris Ashton, CEO of Worley.

This marks Worley's second recent project win. In addition to the US GTL project, Worley also secured a contract to bolster natural gas infrastructure in Mexico.

This project involves expanding Engie's Energia Mayakan pipeline located in the Yucatan peninsula. The expansion aims to significantly boost the pipeline's capacity, from 250 million cubic feet of gas per day to 567 MMcfd.

This increase is intended to address the rising demand for natural gas for power generation and general use within the region.

Worley was chosen as the owner's engineer for this project based on their successful completion of the FEED (front-end engineering and design) phase.

These data releases will significantly impact trading and highlight broader economic trends.

Companies scheduled to release earnings today include Engie Brasil, BRF, Carrefour Brasil, Embraer, Telefonica Brasil, Raia Drogasil, Prio, and GPA.

Analysts expect Telefonica Brasil, known for its Vivo brand, to report promising first-quarter results with higher profit margins, as it continues to expand its customer base.

Financial analysts offer projections for Telefonica Brasil's EBITDA and recurring net profit.

Bank of America forecasts EBITDA to increase 8.1% to R$5.34 billion and net profit to rise 23.7% to R$1.03 billion.

Itaú BBA similarly predicts EBITDA to grow 9.4% to R$5.41 billion, and recurring net profit to expand by 27% to R$1.06 billion.

All eyes now turn to the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) meeting, where members will determine the country's base interest rate, currently at 13.75%.

While analysts anticipate a modest 0.25% reduction in the Selic rate, opinions differ on the long-term trajectory.

This decision will shape the economic outlook and influence financial market movements. In the U.S., Wall Street extended its recent rally after last week's employment data.

The Dow Jones closed up 0.46% at 38,852.27 points, S&P 500 gained 1.03% to 5,180.74 points, and Nasdaq advanced 1.19% to 16,349.24 points.

Investor optimism centers on potential Federal Reserve rate cuts following a noticeable slowdown in U.S. employment growth.

Meanwhile, the Brazilian Ibovespa index dipped slightly by 0.03% to 128,465 points, while the U.S. dollar appreciated 0.07%, reaching R$5.0735.

Market participants remain cautiously optimistic, assessing emerging corporate earnings amid potential shifts in monetary policy.

The company's shares fell 4.5% in early trade.

""Bouygues Immobilier will continue to face a challenging market environment, with low visibility on the timetable for recovery,"" the company said in a statement.

Bouygues announced plans last month to lay off more than a fifth of its real estate staff in France as the construction market weakens.

The family-owned group posted first quarter current operating profit from activities (COPA) of 26 million euros ($28 million), missing a forecast of 34 million euros in a company compiled consensus where estimates ranged from a loss of 17 million euros to a profit of 59 million.

Group sales totalled 12.31 billion euros, broadly in line with the consensus of 12.18 billion, thanks to a 5% increase at energy arm Equans and a 6% jump at its construction unit.

Bouygues, which also operates in civil engineering and the media and telecoms sectors, acquired Equans from French power group Engie in October 2022 as it looked to grow through the energy transition and services.

Equans was combined with Bouygues' existing energy and services business to contribute more than 37% of the group's first quarter sales.

Bouygues said momentum for data centres, smart buildings, solar farms, gigafactories and biotechnology sites remained solid, mainly in Europe and the United States.

However, Equans' backlog was down 2% year-on-year because of the gradual exit from the UK new-build business, notably social housing, due to unfavourable market conditions.

One of the blessings of being a market-leading brand is the ability to activate at scale. The downside is that often, this opportunity is an expectation. Whether developing new products, services or comms, market leaders feel compelled to create with an audience of millions in mind. Within these organisations, experience has shown me that even the edgy, agile, 'test and learn' initiatives carved out to the side are taken on with the knowledge that if they 'work', they'll be rolled out more broadly.

One of the most significant advantages of market leadership is the mindset and ability to operate' at scale'. It's also what makes leading brands so difficult to chase down. While it has its benefits, the 'pursue only that which scales' mindset also has its drawbacks, especially in comms. For one, actions at scale tend to create, by definition, smaller impacts on larger groups of people. For challenger brands, who are not wedded to this approach, there's an opportunity to invert this thinking.

What if you set out to create a tremendous impact on a relatively small group of people, knowing full well that it could never scale beyond that? Sure, it feels almost blasphemous even typing that when so much of what we're taught is about going big or going home.

Love it or hate it, the marketing funnel is still discussed in more presentations than we care to admit. Like the food pyramid, the funnel clearly illustrates where we're meant to focus our attention: smash the carbs and spend big on awareness.

However, instead of focusing on broad-reaching awareness (an expensive strategy that challenger brands can never afford to win) and obsessing about our own sales goals, what if we flipped the funnel and focused on ways of becoming more valuable, impactful and meaningful for a small group of customers?

This notion also forces us to think deeply about our customers' problems and how we can solve them, sending you back down the path of 'extreme value creation'. Something most successful businesses obsess over in their early days but tend to forget about as they scale.

Naturally, it needs to have the right kind of impact on the right sort of customers to reinforce your brand platform in a compelling or dramatic way. It also needs to be financially viable and create talkability, even if only initially amongst the group you're 'unscaling' for.

But challenger brands who can pull off the unscalable are up for more reward than they might anticipate. Human nature dictates that extreme value creation is a two-way street. Going above and beyond for one customer group often results in a sense of obligation from those customers to reciprocate the favour.

This mindset is deeply rooted in reciprocity bias. Behavioural science has proven that humans have an innate desire to help those who've helped them. To understand this behavioural bias, remember an awkward moment when you were given an unexpected gift and didn't have one to exchange in return.

This deeply uncomfortable feeling is the manifestation of reciprocity bias, which also compels us to pay buskers, argue over who pays the bill, and buy a case of wine after a cellar door experience.

It is also why unscalable initiatives are a staple of luxury brands, where margins are high and switching costs are low. For example, Maserati knows that buying one of their cars this time doesn't automatically mean you'll buy one next time. So, the carmaker spends an estimated 25 percent of its marketing budget on the top five percent of its customers.

A new Maserati owner's journey doesn't end with the sale; it signals an entrée into a super exclusive club. New buyers join the Maserati family or La Familia and are invited to special dinners to network with other high-flying owners. They also receive exclusive access to money-can't-buy events and experiences, such as racetrack days and sitting in on rehearsals with the Australian Chamber Orchestra. Beyond the car itself, the value that the La Familia membership creates provides a compelling reason for customers to keep buying Maseratis over Porsches.

Taking it from the high end to the high street, an unassuming pub in the outer suburbs of Melbourne runs one of the best 'unscalable' initiatives I've seen. Watsonia RSL, a favourite of locals since 1952, runs a courtesy bus seven days a week. Every hour on the hour, the bus leaves the pub's front entrance to pick up and drop off patrons within a 10km radius. While it would never be feasible to scale up this service for all pub clientele, it does make a massive difference for the people who use it, including many retired service people.

Many years ago, I learned the power of unscalable moments when our agency worked with PFD, the biggest challenger brand in the foodservice category. Our initial brief was overhauling their online ordering system and helping turbocharge growth through digital channels. We built a magnificent digital experience where customers could browse, search, filter, favourite, re-order from previous transactions and get recommendations based on the ordering patterns of similar businesses. While it worked beautifully for most of PFD's client base, a group of high volume, high-value customers showed almost zero uptake.

Through interviews and site visits, we identified that this group was comprised of very long-term customers who were well-versed with the stock codes and quantities required for everything they needed to order. Searching and filtering were painful and unnecessary for them. In truth, all they wanted was a text box where they could punch in their desired stock codes and quantities, hit enter, and be done with it.

From a technical perspective, this feature was an easy addition. We also knew that it was irrelevant and/or impossible to use for most of PFD's customers. However, for this small, valuable audience, it proved to be the great unlock for adoption and a highly effective way to fend off competitor activity.

Lululemon's Sweat Collective zeroes in on fitness professionals, instructors, and coaches, providing a unique discount program access and specialised training programs and events. This drives direct sales and builds community, and the brand gets a disproportionate upside when all the gym trainers are decked out in Lululemon.

Meanwhile, KFC struck PR gold when it created a secret menu in its mobile app to engage its most hardcore users. Unless you were in the know, namely KFC loyalists, gamers, and 'herbalists', you wouldn't know to scroll down to refresh and hold the screen until a secret menu option appeared. Within it, you'll find custom, weird, wonderful and super generously portioned meals, including fries loaded with popcorn chicken, for just $5.95. While these menu items are limited in their appeal (and commercial viability), certain pockets of the KFC customer base just can't get enough, driving a wave of positive PR.

A similar approach was taken by Simply Energy (now ENGIE) in 2023 when it recognised that more customers would increasingly face financial challenges due to skyrocketing interest rates and a changing economic climate. Many of these customers were facing financial hardship for the first time and Simply Energy figured that these customers may be too proud, or not know how to access help. Simply Energy built a multi-million dollar matching fund and expanded its program of help and support to include content, flexible payment options, and referrals to financial counselling services. Simply's empathy and generosity had a massive impact on a small group of people at a time when they needed it most. It also created positive press and inspired the creation of similar programs in other energy retailers across the country.

The ultimate goal of an 'unscalable' approach is to have a disproportionately large impact on a relatively small group of customers by asking where a little extra effort could go a long way. When done well, this might just leave those customers telling anyone who'll listen that choosing your brand was one of their best decisions.

To get started, consider all the traditional and non-traditional ways of splitting your customer base. Sure, there's age, location and household income, but working with our clients has already turned up many more interesting opportunities; people who visit a university's website between midnight and 2 am. Customers of a pharmacy group who are concerned about their kids vaping. Members of an industry association who also sit on boards of NFPs.

Creating initiatives specifically for these groups costs way less than producing far-reaching TVCs, and we can already see how the impact can be tremendous.",mumbrella.com.au,news,Mumbrella,Lauren McNamara,0.2705882352941176,452725418,1,https://mumbrella.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CC5-e1714990968266.jpg,

Helping businesses make the switch to electric energy. This is the mission given to the start-up Load Stations, based in Nîmes, and hosted at the city's incubator, Bic Innovup. The start-up was created in 2022 by two former engineers from Engie Énergie, after three years of development.

""We are above all a software publisher, and offer companies global management solutions for electric mobility explains co-founder and CEO of the company, Virgile Arène. Our software allows you to connect and manage the company's fleet on all the charging stations for electric vehicles available on the market, whether at the company or at home collaborators.""

Concretely, the company has invented a connected socket which adapts to a normal socket, and allows the employer to reimburse only the current spent by this recharge at the home of the collaborater. This allows him to avoid installing a terminal at the employee's home, and maintain an overall vision of his network. ""By using our connected home socket solutions, large groups divide their costs by 10 and gain flexibility. In fact, the installation of electrical terminals at home would cost them 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to make a big saving.""

The company publishes an application which allows employees of its client companies to edit expense reports resulting from recharges carried out on their vehicle. ""Our software above all allows you to interconnect charging stations, including those which are public, in a car park or a service station for example, and require payment. The employer thus maintains a view of the management of pricing, whether by credit card or any other device.""

The company, which currently has 8 employees, announced last February that it had raised 1.2 million euros in funds. For this, business angels contributed 670,000 euros; in the capital of the company, sum supplemented by a loan of 200,000,000 euros; carried out by the innovation branch of Crédit Agricole, and another of 300,000,000 euros; from BPI France. A sum that will allow the company to recruit, in its city and elsewhere, for its software development and commercial services. This will bring its number to 14 by the end of the semester.

A new, larger fundraising should take place by the end of the year. It will enable the company to achieve its international ambitions. ""The electric market is far from being saturated, we are only at the beginning"", assure the founders, confident in their integrated solution. This allows them to project their business in North America and Morocco, the first country they target for their marketing.",bobrtimes.com,news,bobrtimes.com,,0.1450980392156862,452713787,1,,

8114067960,eng,False,2024-05-06,15:40:14,2024-05-06T15:40:14Z,2024-05-06T15:39:46Z,news,0.0,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4689781-orsted-breezing-past-challenges,Orsted A/S: Finally Some Good News (OTCMKTS:DNNGY),"Despite setbacks, Ørsted delivered solid Q1 2024 results, with higher offshore earnings and progress on projects under construction.

Saying that renewable energy investors have had quite a roller-coaster experience is an understatement. The zero interest rate environment and strong government support made the sector surge after the Covid pandemic, but higher interest rates, supply chain issues, and other headwinds have resulted in a massive correction. After roughly tripling in price, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) is now showing a total return of approximately 41% over the past five years. This is less than half compared to the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE), which focuses on oil and gas companies. Ørsted A/S (OTCPK:DNNGY)(OTCPK:DOGEF), which is arguably the global leader in offshore wind, is actually trading at a lower price compared to five years ago. This is in part the result of massive write-downs it was forced to take related to some of its U.S. projects, where higher interest rates, inflation, and supply issues made the economics of the projects no longer viable.

Still, we have previously argued that this temporary setback probably offers a good buying opportunity to long-term investors. The company has adjusted its business plan to ensure sustainable growth and profitability in the long term, and improved its risk management. While it is disappointing that the dividend has been paused for the next three years, it is a relief that the company has decided not to issue equity at current low prices. In this article, we will review the recently reported Q1 results for financial year 2024, and analyze whether the company is on track to return to profitable growth.

Ørsted delivered a solid first quarter for fiscal year 2024, sharing results on May 2nd. Some of the key takeaways include EBITDA in-line with average analyst expectations, the 924 MW Sunrise Wind project being chosen in New York's fourth offshore wind solicitation which resulted in a partial impairment reversal, and confirmation of their previous 2024 EBITDA guidance.

EBITDA excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees for the first quarter amounted to close to DKK 7.5 billion, DKK 0.6 billion higher than in the same period last year. This was mostly the result of higher offshore earnings, which were DKK 1.1 billion higher compared to the same period the previous year. The increase was thanks to higher wind speeds, ramp-up of Greater Changhua 1 and 2a and South Fork, and higher prices on inflation-indexed contracts.

It was refreshing to see the company deliver a solid quarter, where things appear to be going according to plan. In addition to the impairment reversal related to the Sunrise Wind project, the company reported it has now completed construction of South Fork (130 MW) in the U.S. and Greater Changhua 1 and 2a (900 MW) in Taiwan. The final commissioning of both projects is expected to occur in Q2 2024.

While average onshore wind speeds were slightly below those of a 'normal wind year', this was more than compensated by above average wind speeds in the offshore segment, as can be seen in the graph below.

During the most recent earnings call, the company confirmed things are progressing well in relation to its projects under construction. It has taken some mitigation actions regarding monopile manufacturing, and securing additional installation vessel availability.

During Q1, the company was working on the construction of an impressive 7.6 GW of offshore wind across three regions, and 1.6 GW of onshore projects. To put this in perspective, the company ended the first quarter with installed renewable capacity of 15.7 GW, and the sum of installed, final investment decision made (FID'ed), and awarded/contracted capacity was a total of 27.7 GW. In other words, the company has line-of-sight to almost doubling its energy generation capacity. Some of these projects will probably start contributing to earnings as soon as this year.

Despite last year's setbacks, Ørsted has retained solid credit ratings. The decision to suspend the dividend for three years, and the issuance of hybrid securities must have helped to retain solid credit ratings. The company has a 'BBB' rating from S&P Global (SPGI) with a stable outlook, and a 'Baa1' rating from Moody's (MCO) with a negative outlook. For its part, Fitch Ratings gives the company a 'BBB+' rating with a stable outlook.

Part of the strategy to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating while continuing to invest in new projects, is to finance part of this spending by recycling mature assets. The company reported progress in this respect, selling part of four operational U.S. onshore wind projects to Stonepeak, and selling its French onshore operations to Engie SA (OTCPK:ENGIY).

The company has one of the longest debt maturity schedules we have ever seen, with negligible debt maturing in the next two years, and most debt due after 2030.

While its average effective interest rate costs have gone up slightly in recent years, they remain quite low at roughly 3.3% considering the European Central Bank's key rate is currently at 4%. Ørsted also uses hybrid capital, which are similar to preferred shares, to strengthen its balance sheet, usually with long-term durations of 1,000 years, and where the company has discretion to defer coupon payments without triggering a credit default.

Even after last year's impairments, the company still has a solid debt to assets ratio, and we would expect this to improve once the company starts commissioning projects currently under construction.

One day before announcing earnings, Ørsted shared that it had secured licenses to develop large-scale offshore wind projects in Australia. While this is probably not going to have a meaningful impact any time soon, we did find the news interesting for several reasons. First, it shows the company is once again playing offense, and looking for future growth opportunities, after having had to retrench following the U.S. projects setbacks. Second, it shows that offshore wind opportunities are emerging in new places, and that the company can leverage its experience and learnings as competitive advantages.

In fact, we found one of the most interesting questions asked during the recent earnings call to be regarding potential future developments in Australia. The analyst asking the question remarked that Australia is a relatively immature offshore wind market, and if there is a risk of a similar situation to what happened in the U.S. from happening again. Below, we include CEO Mads Nipper's reply to the analyst.

[...] So this is not a market where you should be concerned that we'll end up in a U.S. situation, both because we have learned the entire industry have learned that it is certainly a challenge to build a new industry entirely from scratch. And I think both we and the entire industry are taking those learnings. We do think it is really important for companies like ours to build the long-term opportunity pipeline. And we do see Australia as a long-term opportunity in offshore.

Specifically, this is an area where, for example, the grid connections due to decommissioned coal power plants in the area where we would likely interconnect. A lot of the infrastructure is already there, but we will go with very open eyes as to what are the risks that would come with an entirely new market and also potentially building a new supply chain in there. So it's not something we will jump on to. We will take a risk-based approach, but we do firmly believe that the long-term potential of the Australian offshore market is attractive.

The outlook for 2024 remains positive, with the company confirming previous guidance of EBITDA excluding new partnership agreements and impacts from potential cancellation fees relating to ceasing the development of Ocean Wind 1, expected in the range of DKK 23 to DKK 26 billion. The company is currently trading with a market cap of DKK 170 billion, and an enterprise value of roughly DKK 246 billion, this puts the forward EV/EBITDA ratio at approximately 10x, which we see as an attractive valuation considering the amount of growth that has been secured.

The company is planning gross investments in 2024 to amount to DKK 48 billion to DKK 52 billion. As we previously mentioned, the company has an enormous project pipeline, with line-of-sight to almost doubling current installed capacity. If that were not enough, the company is already exploring future opportunities like the one recently announced regarding Australia, which could one day exceed 4.8 GW.

Ørsted's valuation has significantly compressed as a result of macroeconomic headwinds, as well as mistakes made by the company. Despite the company having stepped-up its project risk management, it will probably take some time before investors are comfortable assigning higher valuation multiples.

In any case, we find the current valuation attractive, especially when taking into consideration the massive expected growth in installed generation capacity in the coming years. If the company is able to avoid major issues, this should result in very high EBITDA growth for several years.

We currently find the entire sector attractive, and Ørsted has one of the lowest forward EV/EBITDA multiples in the sector. One drawback is that the company has suspended the dividend for three years, while its peers currently have very attractive yields. The closest peer is probably Northland Power (OTCPK:NPIFF), given its high exposure to offshore wind. Brookfield Renewable (BEP)(BEPC) and Innergex (OTCPK:INGXF) have significant hydro power exposure, which we find attractive. Meanwhile, Atlantica Yield (AY) currently has the highest dividend yield, and it is rumored that it could receive a takeover offer soon.

According to the average price target, which can be checked using the ratings tab on Seeking Alpha, there is close to a 17% upside to the average one year analyst price target. We find this target achievable if the company delivers on its guidance and if economic conditions don't materially deteriorate. More importantly, we believe the company can deliver attractive returns to long-term investors, as offshore wind power is expected to continue growing rapidly despite some headwinds.

As we saw with the massive impairments Ørsted took last year, the most significant risks for the company are related to investments made before attractive contracts have been secured. Ørsted has to take these impairments due to higher interest rates, inflation, supply chain issues, and customers that were not willing to adjust their purchase prices to reflect the higher costs needed to complete these projects. Fortunately, once projects are completed, and purchase agreements in place, risks are relatively low and mostly related to wind speeds or potential transmission issues. Risks are mitigated by Ørsted's strong balance sheet, and its willingness to take more preventive measures in the future, even if it means incurring some additional costs.

After reviewing the most recent financial results and guidance from Ørsted, we continue to see shares as materially undervalued. While there are important risks to consider, we believe current prices are below the company's intrinsic value. Analysts on average seem to agree, as the potential return to their one year targets is almost 17%. It was refreshing to have a drama-free earnings report from Ørsted, after the difficult 2023 the company experienced. We also like that the company is once again looking for opportunities, as seen by the recent announcement of a major Australian offshore wind licenses.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,,0.3019607843137255,452706014,1,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1219214553/image_1219214553.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

Ocean Winds was granted the feasibility licence through its bidding company High Sea Wind Pty Ltd. The High Sea Wind project will represent an installed capacity of 1.3 GW, the equivalent of a year of electricity for 1 million Victorian households, avoiding up to 5.3 million tpy of carbon dioxide emissions.

The High Sea Wind project will be delivered with support of Ocean Winds' expertise, which includes about 18 GW of offshore wind projects worldwide (in operations, under construction or secured), and the local footprint of ENGIE. ENGIE has been operating in Australia since 1996 and is deeply involved in the country's energy transition, with 315 MW of renewable energy and storage solutions in operation and more than 3 GW under development.

Paulo ALMIRANTE, ENGIE Senior Executive Vice President Renewables & Energy Management, said: ""This new success, benefitting from and strengthening our position in Australia, is based on Ocean Winds' pioneer role and expertise.

Oil advanced after a weekly drop as Saudi Arabia's price hikes for Asia signaled confidence in the outlook, while Israel's latest moves in the Gaza Strip put the focus back on tensions in the region.

Brent climbed toward US$84 a barrel after posting the biggest weekly loss since February. Saudi Aramco hiked selling prices of all its grades to Asia for June, with the key Arab Light variety raised by more than some refiners estimated. In the Middle East, Israel's military has begun moving civilians out of Rafah, a possible prelude to a long-expected attack on the Gazan city.

That's providing some support for oil after it declined in three of the last four weeks. OPEC and its allies are widely expected to press on with supply cuts in the second half of this year in an attempt to prevent a surplus. The group's laggards Iraq and Kazakhstan have outlined plans on how they will curb flows to compensate for producing above their quotas earlier in the year.

""Crude is trading higher on a combination of renewed Middle East concerns adding some premium back to prices and Saudi signaling robust demand after hiking prices to Asia,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S.

The operation in Rafah comes after talks over the weekend on a potential truce between Israel and Hamas in Cairo broke up inconclusively. ""There are no immediate consequences for the oil market, but the geopolitical risk premium is shifting slightly,"" Engie EnergyScan said in a note.

Options markets, meanwhile, have shed the risk premium as fears of a wider, regional war dissipate. Brent skews are at their most bearish in nearly two months, with the discount of bullish calls to puts at the widest since March.

Brent's prompt spread -- the difference between its two nearest contracts -- has also eased in recent weeks, but remains in a positive, backwardated structure with near-term barrels more costly than those further out. The gap was 56 cents a barrel, down from 93 cents two weeks ago.",bnnbloomberg.ca,news,BNN,,-0.1294117647058823,452695951,1,http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2069088!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/an-employee-walks-along-transport-pipes-leading-to-oil-storage-tanks-at-the-juaymah-tank-farm-at-saudi-aramco-s-ras-tanura-oil-refinery-and-oil-terminal-in-ras-tanura-saudi-arabia-on-monday-oct-1-2018-saudi-aramco-aims-to-become-a-global-refiner-and-chemical-maker-seeking-to-profit-from-parts-of-the-oil-industry-where-demand-is-growing-the-fastest-while-also-underpinning-the-kingdom-s-economic-diversification-photographer-simon-dawson-bloomberg.jpg,eng-9541784

ACCIONA, a global company and a leader in the provision of regenerative solutions for a decarbonized economy, held its first panel discussion in its series of Talks designed to promote regenerative and sustainable solutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The event took place at the Spanish Embassy in Riyadh last Sunday 28th of April and brought together a range of leading figures from across the water field, government, and business to showcase the importance of reverse osmosis technology in the water cycle.

The Riyadh event follows an inaugural panel discussion of its series entitled The Saudi solution for water sustainability: reverse osmosis desalination which explored the winning formula for achieving water sustainability in the Kingdom thanks to the reverse osmosis technology.

Panelists who participated in the event included: Mr. Khaled Al Qourashi (SWPC CEO); Mr. Khalid Al Habib (Chief Investment Officer WTTCO), Mr. Mohammed Alhajjaj (ENGIE KSA CEO) and Manuel Manjon, CEO of ACCIONA's Water business line. The Talk was moderated by Julio de la Rosa, Middle East Business Development Director for the Water Business of ACCIONA. The participants shared their experience in the water field and explained the importance of managing water resources efficiently to meet the needs of the growing population and expanding economy without compromising future generations' ability to access clean water. Also given its arid climate and limited freshwater resources, Saudi Arabia relies heavily on desalination plants to meet its water needs. The speakers emphasized as well how the Saudi Vision 2030 gives the importance of investing in desalination technology such as reverse osmosis, and expanding the capacity of existing desalination plants to ensure a reliable supply of freshwater for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use.

Javier Nieto, KSA Director for the Water business of ACCIONA who participated as the keynote speaker, said that ""ACCIONA's expertise is directly relevant to the Kingdom's Vision 2030 programs and goals. We see ourselves as partners that can enable the Kingdom to realize its vision of creating a vibrant, diversified and more sustainable economy and society. For example, the seven desalinations and wastewater treatment plants that we are building -and the two desalination plants that we have recently completed- will improve the water security of 8.3 million people and make the country more resilient to climate shocks"".

Saudi Arabia is one of the world's largest producers of desalinated water, with numerous desalination plants along its coastline. Reverse osmosis technology plays a vital role in addressing water scarcity challenges in the Kingdom by providing a sustainable and reliable source of clean water for different sectors and applications, contributing to the country's economic development, environmental sustainability, and social well-being.

Total desalinated water production in the Middle East will be 13 times higher in 2040 than it was in 2014, according to the latest ACCIONA Sustainability Report. In a region with acute water scarcity, demand for desalinated water is being driven by climate change and population growth. Saudi Arabia, which has a population of about 33.4 million, is the world's third largest per capita consumer of water after the United States and Canada.

ACCIONA desalinates water using the most efficient reverse osmosis technology. The use of this technology emits 6.5 times fewer greenhouse gases than thermal desalination technologies.",smartwatermagazine.com,news,Smart Water Magazine,,0.3803921568627451,452684458,1,https://smartwatermagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/share-tw-830x415/public/acciona_saudi_arabia.jpg?itok=u37YSIsV,

The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub was up 0.71 euros at 30.85 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) at 0841 GMT, LSEG data showed.

""We consider sideways trading as the most likely scenario again today,"" analysts at Energi Danmark said in a morning report.

Supply in Europe remains healthy and while geopolitical tensions surrounding the Middle East and Ukraine remain a concern, they appeared not quite as high on the agenda compared with a few weeks ago, they added.

In the Middle East, Israel started evacuations of parts of Rafah on Monday ahead of a long-threatened assault on Hamas holdouts, and in Ukraine, Russia kept up its attacks on energy infrastructure.

However, gas storage levels in Europe remain comfortable, with prices for the moment having no reason to rise to or above the one-year average, Engie EnergyScan said in its daily market report.

The TTF front month has averaged around 34 euros/MWh over the past year, according to LSEG data.

Europe's gas storage sites were last seen 63.3% full, Gas Infrastructure Europe data shows.

""So, the market seems to have good reasons to maintain a wait-and-see position,"" Engie EnergyScan said.

Further in, the Dutch day-head contract was up by 0.78 euros at 30.88 euros/MWh.

The British market is closed for a national holiday.

Below normal wind power generation is increasing gas demand from the power sector, LSEG data showed.

Meanwhile, the weather over the next two weeks will be ""slightly unsettled with near or above normal temperatures and no longer lasting dry spells"", LSEG meteorologist Georg Mueller said.

In 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that between 2020 and 2030, Africa is likely to see its energy demand jump by a third, putting pressure on the continent's governments to expand their power-generation facilities.

With this in mind, the most recent edition of the Africa Solar Industry Association's (AFSIA) annual report on the state of the continent's solar sector makes for some encouraging reading. In 2023, Africa added 3.7GW of new solar capacity in 2023, a record figure. This marks four consecutive years of growth in the African solar sector, from 0.9GW of capacity additions in 2020 to 1.1GW in 2021 and 3.1GW in 2022, and suggests that there is interest both in agreeing to build, and actually breaking ground, on new solar projects in the continent.

However, with many of the obvious challenges present for such a rapidly developing power sector, including the resilience of local power grids and the ability of various governments to effectively regulate this rapidly changing energy mix, continuing this streak of record capacity additions, and building a resilient renewables sector for Africa as a whole, loom large as challenges for the future.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of the African solar sector is the extent to which South Africa dominates the industry. In 2023, AFSIA notes that South Africa added 2.9GW of new solar capacity, pushing its total installed solar capacity above 7GW. This figure accounts for close to half of Africa's total installed solar capacity.

""We're seeing a lot of growth, especially across the largest economies, such as South Africa and Kenya,"" says James Shoetan, chief commercial officer at CrossBoundary Energy, a renewable energy developer based in Kenya with projects across a number of African markets.

This emphasis on larger markets explains much of the interest in the South African solar sector in particular, as this is a country with significant renewable power targets and robust legislation that aims to encourage investment in new clean power projects. The South African government released its Integrated Resource Plan, setting out a framework for the country's energy mix, in 2010, and the following year, new definitions for power purchase agreements and independent power producers were passed, vital steps in encouraging large-scale private investment into the South African solar sector.

""A lot of this is driven by strong solar radiation, electricity supply and cost dynamics, of which the latter tends to be the biggest driver,"" says Shoetan, who adds that, in South Africa, there is a business case for many of these investments. ""We have seen that, with solar, you can compete with the vast majority of grid prices in Africa because some of them are really high.""

South Africa also has an outsized impact on the rest of the African solar sector, as the more mature status of its market means other countries' sectors are often following in its wake.

""In South Africa, which saw more than 2GW of new commercial and industrial (C&I) capacity installed in 2023, C&I is embraced by the entire economy as a result of load-shedding, which is plaguing the country,"" says John van Zuylen, AFSIA CEO, whose organisation's report draws strong parallels between South Africa individually and the African solar sector as a whole. ""Hundreds of businesses have had no other choice but switch to solar to continue their operations.""

This relationship is perhaps the clearest in terms of capacity additions. As the graph below demonstrates, using AFSIA figures, save for a three-year period in the late 2010s, South Africa's capacity additions have been the driving force behind capacity additions in the whole of Africa, to the point where, in 2023, South Africa accounted for more than 75% of the continent's newly installed solar capacity.

However, this is not to say that the South African solar sector is not without challenges that will need to be overcome for both the benefit of South Africa, and the rest of the African solar sector, which will look to follow in its footsteps.

A key challenge is one of scale, and expanding the solar sector from one that accounts for a small portion of the country's energy mix to one that is making a significant contribution to South African power.

According to the US International Trade Administration, as of 2023, 80% of South Africa's energy demands were still met by coal-fired power plants, and addressing these macro challenges for the sector, from reducing reliance on fossil fuel generation to building the necessary grid infrastructure for renewables to take their place, hang over the industry.

""The main question is to see at what speed these grid improvements and largescale projects can be developed and built, while on the other side C&I gets cheaper every day and can be installed very rapidly,"" says Van Zuylen, pointing out that, while solar is an attractive investment, scaling up solar will have to be done quickly and effectively.

Beyond South Africa, both Shoetan and Van Zuylen suggest that solar could form part of a more diverse energy mix for the entire continent. This approach could reduce the stress on the solar sector in particular, as solar developers are not put in a position where they are expected to make up for the entirety of Africa's lost fossil fuel generation capacity, but just one part of a more diverse energy mix.

""What I think is that you will see some wind,"" says Shoetan. ""We're also doing wind, where it makes sense. One of our coolest projects is for Rio Tinto in Madagascar; what we're doing [is] wind plus solar plus batteries, all integrated with their existing generator fleet, to bring them up to 70% renewable contribution in the future.""

Thanks to new and efficient storage solutions, there is indeed hope that largescale solar-plus-storage plants can be built across the continent in the near future,"" agrees Van Zuylen. ""Without storage, it would be practically impossible to add a consequent number of large-scale solar projects in most African countries because of the weakness of the transmission and distribution grid. But storage can remedy this problem for the main part.""

Van Zuylen also suggests that many of the off-grid benefits of solar investment in South Africa are applicable to Africa more broadly, with solar an opportunity for those in countries with less developed grid infrastructure to help meet energy demand. Off-grid power supply has seen considerable domestic and international interest in recent years, with the World Bank estimating that, between 2000 and 2023, the number of mini-grids in operation across Africa has increased from 500 to 3,000.

Similarly, projects such as the European Investment Bank and ENGIE's Energy Access programme, and the USAID's Power Africa initiative, look to draw international investment towards new power programmes in Africa.

""Several regional power pools have also made significant progress recently, most notably in West Africa,"" explains Van Zuylen. ""These power pools also act as some form of grid-stabilising storage and for a better distribution of generation and consumption across the entire connected grid, therefore creating opportunities for new large-scale solar projects.""

Yet not all markets can benefit from investment in the same power generation sources, with Shoetan noting that, in the case of grid infrastructure, different countries could benefit from additional funding for their grids, versus battery facilities.

""When you have a strong grid, it doesn't make as much sense to have batteries,"" says Shoetan. ""So, for instance, you'll see, in Kenya, there aren't a lot of businesses with big batteries because the grid is pretty strong.""

The diversity of the African energy mix is perhaps most apparent in the breakdown of the continent's solar sector. AFSIA figures note that, in 2023, 65% of new capacity additions were made in the C&I sector, mirroring the sector's growth in South Africa, and continuing a trend seen in recent years. In 2022, the C&I sector added 1.6GW of new capacity, compared to 1.4GW for utility-scale deployments, and this difference jumped in 2023, with the C&I sector adding 2.4GW of new capacity, compared to just 1.2GW of utility-scale capacity.

""Based on solar projects info collected by AFSIA for projects since 2006 in Africa, there has been a phenomenal evolution of the C&I segment in Africa,"" explains Van Zuylen. ""For many years, C&I was barely existent as large-scale grid-connected projects were the norm in Africa.

""But since 2017, C&I started to grow and represent a real niche market on its own. And in 2022, C&I even became more important than large-scale across the continent, driven mostly by the tsunami of C&I installations in South Africa as a result of the load-shedding crisis.""

This ""tsunami"", as Van Zuylen puts it, comes at a time where interest in other sectors, notably, utility-scale, is cooling. According to Shoetan, the fact that utility-scale projects often require developers to work with national governments makes such projects less enticing for these developers.

""Utility-scale involves government entities ... we find can move slowly and they have a lot of levels and bureaucracy to move through,"" says Shoetan. ""Also, a lot of these are project financed, which also require you to get a shovel-ready project, and then shop it around to different investors who then have feedback on that project because it's not quite shovel-ready, and so you have this back-and-forth.""

However, the African solar sector is likely to include a combination of utility-scale projects and the booming C&I segment, with Shoetan suggesting that utility-scale will continue to play a key role in the sector.

""Every single piece has a part to play,"" Shoetan says. ""Utility-scale? We still see that happening. We'll see C&I, which generally start [with] smaller [capacity], start to catch up in some of those places now that people are seeing that it's viable [and] people are doing it.""

The graph below demonstrates how, while C&I installations have grown considerably in recent years, they are not singularly responsible for new capacity additions in Africa, and the sector is as diverse as Shoetan expects. According to AFSIA figures, between 2022 and 2023, the African mini-grid sector's annual capacity additions increased from 7.1MW to 11.7MW, while its solar home system capacity increased from 86.9MW to 90MW.

The growth of the C&I sector in particular is demonstrative of Africa as an attractive investment destination, according to Van Zuylen, who says that a demand for electricity is driving much of this transition.

""For starters, it is the overall poor service level of African utilities and grids which is creating this need,"" begins Van Zuylen. ""Businesses need electricity to operate. Most of them would prefer to work with a reliable national utility providing a regular electricity supply. But in the absence thereof, these businesses accept the imperfect situation or rely on diesel generators when the cost is viable, for example, when diesel is subsidised.""

But the falling cost of solar is now making it particularly attractive to businesses. This is echoed by a number of research organisations. The International Energy Agency (IEA), for example, notes in its latest forecasts that the cost of generating electricity from solar sources in Africa is expected to be as low as US$18-49/MWh by 2030, compared to US$33-86/MWh for onshore wind and US$30-110/MWh for gas, making solar investments attractive for developers, and solar power enticing for buyers.

""This trend is further amplified by a growing offering of financing solutions, which remove the barrier of the initial solar capex, as well as the notable example of Nigeria where the fuel subsidy has recently been removed, thereby revealing to the wider public the true cost of diesel kilowatt-hours and the fact that solar is in many cases the more economically viable option,"" adds Van Zuylen.

""We've been the first company to get licences to sell power privately across Ghana, Kenya, Sierra Leone [and] Somalia,"" adds Shoetan, also pointing to specific jurisdictions where there is potential for new solar investment. ""We leverage those licensing frameworks, that we've helped develop for the regulatory bodies, to help other countries apply those as well.

Operating in a region as diverse as Africa poses challenges for actors across the solar sector, but Shoetan is optimistic that his company's work in one region could inform work in other countries, creating the opportunity for developers in one area to learn from those in others.

""Drawing from our experiences on working with Ghana [and] Kenya across their licensing regimes, I think it was quite helpful there,"" says Shoetan. ""I think the technology is quite ubiquitous these days, it's just more about the cost curve coming down and down and down. From a technology standpoint, it's not really that different, [but] from a delivery standpoint, it's very different.""

Shoetan notes that this desire to improve, and learn from other work, could be of benefit to solar developers themselves. He described his company's work as having to become more multifaceted in recent years and that developers need expertise today that they may not have needed in earlier years, creating an opportunity for developers to learn too.

""For us, what we've had to do is develop in-house competencies across just about every single area required to make a renewable energy project happen,"" says Shoetan. ""We've had to build up and invest in our own in-house engineering, development, regulatory, finance [and] legal teams, that allow us to move very quickly.""

Ultimately, this could be of benefit for the African solar sector as a whole. There is considerable demand for new solar power, and a range of investors and developers keen to become involved in the sector. Shoetan concludes that the outlook for the African solar sector as a whole is highly encouraging.

""I think for others who are interested, there's definitely loads of room,"" Shoetan says. ""I don't think it's going to get saturated anytime soon, and given the growth, as well, there's definitely a lot to do.""",pv-tech.org,news,PV Tech,Jp Casey,0.3333333333333333,452682631,1,https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/syrah-resources.jpeg,eng-9541699

With a combined capacity of 8 gigawatts (GW), the projects represent $9bn in foreign direct investment, according to an official Cabinet statement.

These projects are a significant milestone, marking some of the largest onshore wind power developments in the Middle East and globally. Developed under a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) model, they highlight Egypt's commitment to renewable energy.

Scatec will independently develop the first project with a 5 GW capacity. The Orascom Construction-led consortium, collaborating with the New and Renewable Energy Development Authority (NREA), will independently develop the 3 GW second project in phases.

Mohamed Shaker, Egypt's Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, emphasized the projects' scale and significance. Site studies, including technical assessments, environmental impact analyses, and other crucial evaluations, are slated to begin immediately for both projects.

The land handover protocols were signed by NREA Executive Chairperson Mohamed El Khayat and Scatec CEO Terje Pilskog for the first project. Orascom Construction Executive Director Khaled El Degwy represented the consortium, which includes Electrobras (a subsidiary of France's ENGIE) and Japan's Eurus Energy Holdings Corporation.
