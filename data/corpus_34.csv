Until March, the electrical grid had largely avoided the pounding that Russian forces inflicted in 2023, which brought the country to the brink of total electrical collapse. This was thanks to an air defense system that intercepted a large number of missiles and drones.

However, due to Western delays in arms deliveries, the air defenses have run low on ammunition, and Russian missiles are increasingly hitting their targets.

In contrast to the previous campaign against Ukraine's energy sector, which focused on destroying the electrical distribution grid, Russian forces are now directly targeting thermal and hydroelectric power plants.

Consequently, Ukraine has lost 70% of its available generation capacity, with only 14 gigawatts remaining out of the previous 36.7, Olena Pavlenko, an energy expert and director of the Ukrainian think tank DiXi Group, told Euromaidan Press.

""With Ukraine having lost 70% of its electricity generation, everyone is asking what can be done. Unfortunately, we've reached a point where there is no quick and easy answer,"" says Pavlenko.

DiXi Group estimates that Ukraine's losses in thermal power generation capacity could reach up to 85%.

Euromaidan Press consulted experts to better understand the situation, the state of restoration efforts, and the specific needs.

Russian attacks have caused $12.5 billion in damage to Ukrainian energy infrastructure, according to Andrii Gerus, Chairman of the Ukrainian parliament Committee on Energy Issues.

To facilitate the restoration of Ukraine's energy system, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine and the European Commission established the Ukraine Energy Support Fund in April 2022. The Fund, managed by the Energy Community Secretariat in Vienna, Austria, allows governments, international organizations, and corporate donors to provide financial support to Ukraine's energy sector.

As of May 2024, the Fund has received approximately €400 million ($434 million), with the five largest donors being:

The Fund provides monthly procurement reports through infographics.

While Ukraine also receives assistance through embassies, charitable foundations, and organizations, there are no publicly available consolidated statistics.

It is evident that the incoming aid is insufficient compared to the losses incurred.

""Based on public information, we have no good news yet. There may be positive developments happening behind the scenes that we don't know about, but looking at the current situation, I have no reason to deliver good news,"" says Olena Pavlenko, an energy expert and director of the Ukrainian think tank DiXi Group.

The number of power stations Ukraine can restore before autumn depends on two factors.

First, the quantity and type of equipment Ukraine receives will determine its restoration capacity. If expensive turbines and other critical components are delivered quickly, Ukraine can restore some power stations, although not to pre-war levels.

Ukraine's most urgent needs are complex, as Russians target both power generation and transmission lines.

""We need everything from transformers and cables to pylons and repair vehicles for electrician crews,"" says Pavlenko.

Thermal and hydroelectric power plants require large turbines, spare generators, and even control room electronics.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private electricity company, has launched a campaign asking countries to donate used equipment they no longer need. The electricity equipment that can be used in Ukraine is primarily located in the post-Soviet countries of Eastern Europe, many of which have already started working on donating it.

The second factor is the availability of powerful air defense systems. On 11 April, Russia destroyed the giant Trypilska thermal power plant with Kh-69 cruise missiles. As President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later explained, it happened because Ukraine had completely run out of missiles for the air defense systems protecting the facility.

""Some 11 missiles were flying at the Trypilska power plant. Ukraine's air defenses destroyed the first seven, and four destroyed the plant. Why? Because we had zero missiles left. We ran out of all the missiles to protect it,"" Zelenskyy said.

He stated Ukraine urgently needs at least seven Patriot air defense systems, two of which are for the city of Kharkiv which Russia bombards daily.

Restoring large power stations without adequate protection is pointless, as Russians have demonstrated their ability to penetrate existing defenses, especially with combined attacks using drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles.

Despite the pressing need for assistance, including air defense systems, the delivery of aid has been sluggish, with Western nations attributing the delays to regulations and bureaucratic processes. However, for Ukraine, where the situation is dire, these explanations ring hollow.

""If Western countries want to play politics, follow procedures, and everything else, then they should be prepared for the situation to worsen. If they want to provide real assistance, they need to prioritize aid deliveries as quickly as possible,"" emphasizes Pavlenko.

Ukraine has suffered the most losses in thermal power generation from coal-fired plants, which were essential for balancing the entire energy system. The Russians deliberately targeted these plants, knowing their importance.

""When everyone starts turning on lights, washing machines, boilers, and kettles in the morning or evening, consumption increases significantly. Thermal power generation covered these peaks. It could be quickly started up to meet the needs. Now we can't do this, hence the blackouts,"" explains Pavlenko.

Despite a one-third decrease in overall electricity demand (16% for consumers, 45% for industry), Ukraine's energy system struggles to meet the existing needs. Consumers face daily blackouts, with the worst situation in the heavily shelled eastern regions. Ukrenergo, the state energy provider, and regional energy companies (Oblenergos) determine blackout schedules in cooperation with the Ministry of Energy.

Throughout the summer, energy deficits are expected to peak in July, according to Roman Hrabchak, Head of the Balance Reliability Department at Ukrenergo.

""July is currently considered the most challenging month. This is when there is a lack of water for hydroelectric power plants, repairs are underway, and damaged thermal power plant equipment will not yet be restored in time,"" Hrabchak explained during the presentation of a study by the DiXi Group.

Industry suffers even more from blackouts as Ukraine prioritizes consumers, threatening the already war-contracted economy. The New York Times reported that intensified Russian attacks raise concerns about power cuts affecting Ukraine's defense industry, although Ukrenergo assured that the defense industry is protected and often has autonomous power sources.

Moreover, Ukrainian consumers have already faced a 50%+ electricity price hike, yet a stable power supply remains elusive.

Nuclear power, providing half of Ukraine's electricity, keeps the country's energy system afloat alongside European imports. However, nuclear plants must undergo scheduled maintenance during the summer to ensure continuous operation in winter when demand is higher.

""The challenge is getting through the summer when nuclear plants go offline for maintenance and preparation for winter,"" says Pavlenko.

Unlike countries that are abandoning nuclear energy, Ukraine plans to expand its nuclear power plants - a decision already made by the government. However, these will be a new type of nuclear power plant.

""These are small modular reactors, modern technologies that are very different from what we are used to. They are smaller, more localized, and faster to build. But not fast enough to help us prepare for the next winter,"" Pavlenko explains.

The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) poses a separate challenge for Kyiv. The plant is connected to the Ukrainian power grid, which supplies electricity to the station's critical infrastructure.

""Ukraine feeds the ZNPP with a single power line that is constantly under fire. When cut off, the plant runs on local generators until the line is restored, which is crucial for the plant's safety and survival under occupation. We are trying to keep it in a safe mode,"" Pavlenko adds.

Hydroelectric power plants on the Dnipro and Dniester rivers are also crucial for balancing Ukraine's energy system. Despite the loss of the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station dam in Zaporizhzhia, hit by eight Russian missiles in March 2024, and the destruction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station by the Russians in 2023, other hydroelectric plants continue to operate and stabilize the energy grid.

Bohdan Sukhetskyi, Commercial Director of Ukrhydroenergo, Ukraine's main hydropower generating company, explained the challenges faced in the restoration process.

""Ukrhydroenergo uses specific equipment that requires a long manufacturing time and significant funding. At present, some of the equipment, financed by international partners, is in the process of being manufactured,"" Sukhetskyi told Euromaidan Press.

Renewable energy cannot replace lost generation on its own, as it depends on external conditions and provides power only when there is sun or wind.

Electricity imports from EU countries are another crucial factor in keeping Ukraine's energy system afloat. Initially, it was expected that Ukraine would import electricity for emergency needs - when a need arose, Ukraine would request imports, import, and then stop. Now, it is almost constant importation.

""It's uncertain how this will be managed when electricity consumption and prices rise in Europe during hot weather. It's a formula with many unknowns,"" says Pavlenko.

Ukraine imports the maximum allowed by the system - 1.7 gigawatts, about 10% of its needs. This is the capacity limit; importing more is physically impossible.

Ukraine is currently importing natural gas-powered solutions, such as gas piston units, at both the state and local levels. However, the procurement volumes are not disclosed for understandable reasons.

""I'm uncertain if we can purchase enough gas piston units to fully replace our lost thermal power generation and prepare for winter. We may cover needs in small areas, but there will likely still be territories where consumers experience shortages,"" says Pavlenko.

Gas piston units are far less powerful than thermal power plants like the massive Trypilska facility. While the Trypilska plant generated electricity and heat for three Ukrainian oblasts, gas piston units are much smaller and can only cover local needs in individual districts, towns, or villages. They cannot fully replace coal-fired generation.

Gas piston units may have been the key to Ukraine successfully navigating the winter of 2023/2024, although the exact details are unknown.

""The question remains: how many of these gas piston units and other small-scale solutions do we need to cover the entire country's needs?"" Pavlenko adds.

Despite the challenges, gas piston units are part of the solution, and Ukraine has limited alternatives.

The move enables the offshore wind research lease, located about 28 nautical miles off Maine, to advance. Maine has 30 calendar days to accept, reject or request modifications to the lease.

""Floating wind technology can make offshore wind a reality in the Gulf of Maine,"" said BOEM Director Elizabeth Klein. ""BOEM will continue to work in partnership with the state of Maine as we move forward to facilitate the responsible development of offshore wind in this region, as well as the deployment of floating offshore wind technology nationwide.""

The state requested the research lease in October 2021 to study floating offshore wind energy technology and its deployment. If developed, the site would include up to 12 floating offshore wind turbines capable of generating up to 144 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy, according to BOEM.

The U.S. aims to have 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 15 GW of floating wind capacity by 2035.

Here's a look at other renewable energy news this week.

Waga Energy and Engie signed a biomethane purchase agreement (BPA) for renewable natural gas produced at the Veolia site in Claye-Souilly near Paris, Waga said on May 29.

The 13-year contract, which is the longest BPA signed to date in France, values the biomethane at a higher price than the subsidized tariff, Waga said in a news release. ""This enables Waga Energy to secure financing for the production unit through a long-term credit facility with the banks CIC and Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels,"" the company said.

The contract took effect May 1.

Up to 120 gigawatt hours (GWh) of RNG, equivalent to the consumption of 20,000 households, is produced annually at the Veolia site, according to Waga.

""Veolia is a key player in the production of bioenergy, already producing 1.6 terawatt-hour of biogas from waste anaerobic digestion in France alone,"" Veolia CEO Estelle Brachlianoff said. ""Through this partnership with Waga Energy and Engie, we are contributing to the development of a genuine green gas production industry at the European level, essential for the ecological transformation.""

Energy storage provider Torus will provide 26 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy storage capacity across a portion of real estate developer Gardner Group's portfolio, equivalent to powering nearly 1,000 homes for a full day.

Under a landmark deal, Torus will install its Torus Station energy storage and management system at Gardner's multiple properties, the company announced May 29.

The Torus Stations will integrate ""advanced"" battery and flywheel energy storage systems with Torus' software platform.

Torus said the integration enables energy management and demand response capabilities and connects renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The systems will be manufactured at Torus' South Salt Lake City, Utah, facility and are expected to begin installation in fourth-quarter 2024 with completion by first-quarter 2026.

""Partnering with Torus allows us to optimize our energy management, reduce our carbon footprint and provide enhanced value to our tenants,"" said Christian Gardner, CEO of Gardner Group. ""We look forward to the positive impact this project will have on our properties and the broader community.""

Verbund, an Austria-based electricity company, partnered with TotalEnergies and EREN Groupe joint venture company TE H2 to study implementation of a green hydrogen project in Tunisia.

Called H2 Notos, hydrogen would be produced with electrolyzers powered by onshore wind and solar energy with desalinated sea water, TotalEnergies said May 28. Ambitions are to initially produce 200,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, potentially scaling up to 1 million tons per year.

""H2 Notos has the potential to become a significant supplier of green hydrogen for Europe while fostering significant jobs creation in Tunisia,"" said TE H2 CEO David Corchia. ""We are entering into a phase of greenfield development and major technical work to assess the feasibility of the project and we will need to further deepen the highly constructive and fruitful collaboration we have enjoyed with the national and local authorities through H2 Notos.""

The hydrogen will access the European market via the SoutH2 Corridor hydrogen pipeline, which is expected to be commissioned around 2030. The pipeline connects North Africa to Italy, Austria and Germany.

Verbund will coordinate the transport of hydrogen toward Central Europe, according to the release, while TE H2 and Verbund will jointly develop, finance, construct and operate the project, according to the release.

Italy, Germany and Austria have signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of a network to transport hydrogen from the southern Mediterranean to northern Europe, the energy ministries of the three countries said on May 30.

The official announcement marks a concrete step in the European Union's strategy to secure renewable hydrogen supplies by 2030 to help decarbonize its most polluting industries.

""The Southern Hydrogen Corridor will provide renewable hydrogen imports from North Africa via southern Italy and further connect to the major hydrogen demand hubs in Italy, Austria and Germany,"" the German ministry said in a statement.

The link dubbed SoutH2, which last year won priority status from the European Commission, is considered important to develop a European market for renewable fuel.

A group of companies, including Italian gas grid operator Snam, have teamed up to build the SoutH2 pipeline by the beginning of the next decade, with a financial commitment of more than 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).

EDP Renewables North America has completed its 175-MW Crooked Lake Solar Park in Arkansas, the company said May 29.

Located near Blytheville in Mississippi County, the solar park is expected to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 30,000 Arkansas homes annually. The solar park is the latest utility-scale addition for EDPR, which now has facilities in 19 U.S. states.

""We're proud to continue our expansion in the South with a focus on serving the clean energy needs of Arkansas,"" stated EDP Renewables North America CEO Sandhya Ganapathy. ""By providing sustainable energy to Mississippi County and the surrounding area, we are generating economic growth and grid stability for generations to come in the region.""

The solar park, located on an approximately 1,800-acre site, utilizes single-axis tracking photovoltaic panels.

Florida-based Apricus Generation has acquired a controlling interest in Nexus Renewables, a solar and energy storage developer, according to a May 29 news release.

Nexus, which has a pipeline of about 500 MW of solar and energy storage projects in North America, is the first strategic acquisition of Apricus. The holding company launched earlier this year.

""As with many independent developers, Nexus has more project opportunities than access to capital,"" said Gautam Chandra, executive chairman and co-founder of Apricus Generation. ""By joining Apricus, they now have access to capital and expertise that will allow them to execute on their pipeline.""

New Jersey officials said the state will receive $125 million from a legal settlement with Denmark's Ørsted over the company's cancellation last year of two offshore wind farm projects.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities said in a statement that the funds will be used for investments in wind component manufacturing facilities and wind farms.

The settlement comes nearly seven months after Ørsted said it would stop developing the Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects off the coast of New Jersey as it struggled with soaring costs and supply chain delays.

The cancellations triggered an angry response from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who is banking on offshore wind to help achieve the state's climate change goals.

His administration said it would speed up the state's plans to procure additional offshore wind capacity by soliciting bids for new projects in the second quarter of 2025, more than a year ahead of schedule.

The utility regulator also said it would pause an offshore wind transmission planning effort with the regional power grid operator, PJM Interconnection, while it considers the impact of a new rule from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that reforms how large power lines are approved and paid for.",hartenergy.com,news,Hart Energy,,0.2549019607843137,454876280,8,https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2024/05/et-roundup_0.jpg?itok=wJmtyrgu,

Tashkent, Uzbekistan (UzDaily.com) -- Trips of the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev to the regions are traditionally accompanied by the launch of major projects. Thus, today the construction of large energy and transport complexes has begun in Bukhara region.

Over the past five years, the volume of the processing industry in our country has increased 1.4 times, and last year alone it amounted to 553 trillion soums. In Bukhara, this figure increased 1.6 times and reached 30 trillion soums.

In the region, work is underway on 41 projects worth US$7 billion in foreign investment and 39 projects through local investment for the same amount.

It is planned to build three more large facilities - a gas chemical complex, a solar power plant and an international airport in Bukhara.

At the start of work ceremony, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev emphasized the importance of these projects.

The gas chemical complex, which will be built in the Karakul free economic zone, will be the first plant in our country operating using the methanol to olefins (MTO) technology.

The project will attract about US$5 billion in investments and advanced technologies from the USA, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Italy and China. The complex will process 1.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 430 thousand tons of naphtha per year with the production of 1.1 million tons of polymer products in demand both on the domestic and global markets. According to calculations, the added value of these products will exceed the cost of gas by five times.

The new plant will employ 2 thousand people. In addition, it will give impetus to the creation of dozens of enterprises in the construction, textile, leather and footwear, automotive, electrical and other related industries, and will lead to the creation of another 4 thousand jobs.

The launch of these projects will turn Bukhara into a ""driver"" not only of tourism, but also of industry.

Steady economic growth increases demand for electricity by an average of 6 percent per year. Therefore, new generating capacities are being created in the regions.

In recent years, 10 solar and wind power plants with a capacity of 2 gigawatts have come online with US$2 billion in foreign investment. Currently, 32 green generation facilities with a total capacity of 18.3 gigawatts worth US$19 billion are being built together with foreign partners.

The first 2.6 gigawatts of 14 solar and wind farms will come online this year. As a result, the share of renewable energy in the total electricity production in our country will increase from 9 to 15 percent. In general, by 2030 this figure is planned to increase to 40 percent.

In this, of course, sunny Bukhara occupies a special place. Currently, 9 large projects with a capacity of 4 gigawatts worth about US$4.5 billion in foreign investment are being implemented in the region.

Now they will be added to a solar power plant with a capacity of 250 megawatts, which will be built by the Masdar company from the United Arab Emirates. 648 hectares of land have been allocated for this project in the Alat region. The station is planned to be connected to the unified energy grid in December 2025.

In addition, renewable energy complexes are being built in the Bukhara region by ACWA Power from Saudi Arabia and Gezhouba from China. By 2030, the region's capacity will increase 9 times - up to 12.5 billion kilowatt-hours of green energy per year.

Another project that has started is a new international airport.

Thanks to the openness policy of our state, ties with the world are strengthening. Uzbekistan has introduced a visa-free regime for citizens of more than 90 countries.

As a result, the flow of foreign visitors has increased. Over the past 2 years, the share of tourism in exports of services has reached 40 percent. 283 hotels, 486 hostels, 1.2 thousand family guest houses were built. Tourist flow increased by 35 percent.

Thus, in 2023, about 1.4 million foreign tourists came to Bukhara.

Such factors require an increase in the number of flights at the region's international airport. Therefore, on the terms of a private partnership, it is planned to build a new international airport in the Bukhara region.

This US$226 million project will create airport infrastructure that meets international standards. Conditions are provided to serve 1.2 thousand passengers per hour. By improving the quality of service for passengers and aircraft, new international airlines will be attracted.

President Shavkat Mirziyoyev launched the construction of these complexes by pressing a symbolic button.

GGF intends to financially back renewable energy projects supported by government auctions and ones with different kinds of PPAs

""We see great potential in the renewables sector, which was over the previous period not sufficiently invested in. Serbia is one of the most important markets for us, and we will be very active here in the following period, by financing particularly the projects for renewable energy sources. They include the ones supported through the auctions organized by the government and also via different kinds of power purchase agreements"" or PPAs, he stated at the event.

""It is quite clear that the main task and the main role in the energy system of the future will be played by renewables,"" stressed Leonore Gewessler, Austria's energy minister, as she shuttled from the breakfast get-together to the wider meeting of all EU energy ministers.

In Europe, two informal blocs are waging a quiet struggle: the pro-renewables group and the pro-nuclear alliance, who each count at least 13 countries. Founded by Austria and France, respectively, the groups insist on their own energy vision for the EU.

2023 saw key gains for the nuclear alliance, having won recognition for their chosen technology in the EU's core industrial policy law, the Net-Zero Industrial Act, while the EU electricity market reform empowered Paris to subsidise their ageing reactors, too.

With the cards in Brussels are due for a shuffle following the EU election on 6-9 June, the renewables alliance is looking for ground.

""The friends of renewables are working on our priorities for the next Commission,"" Gewessler confirmed. A document is forthcoming, Euractiv understands.

Given that current Commission predictions forecast an 80% share for renewables by 2040, the goal should be to ""create positive and accelerating conditions.""

Renewables provide an ""independent, resilient, climate-friendly and cheap"" energy system which made them the ""way to go,"" Gewessler emphasised.

Spain's Energy Minister Teresa Ribera, who co-chaired the renewables gathering on Thursday, similarly stressed that ""a commitment to strategic autonomy in energy matters requires greater investment in renewable energies"".

The Spanish politician has expressed her ambition to assume the powerful energy and climate portfolio in the next Commission, and is the frontrunner for the Spanish centre-left PSOE in the EU elections.

The Czech-French-led nuclear alliance did not hold a meeting that day, although the group has traditionally sought to match meetings of their renewable rivals with meetings of their own.

Luxembourg automotive industry veteran Jean-Marc Gales is championing zero emissions public transport and believes Europe should look to hydrogen in addition to electric buses as it forges ahead with energy transition plans.

""Europe has a real opportunity, with the right industrial policy, to become a world leader in hydrogen,"" Gales told the Luxembourg Times.

Since April 2023 he has been the CEO of Northern Ireland bus maker Wrightbus, which is the UK leader in zero emissions buses and is now seeking to make inroads into Europe.

It is fair to say that Gales - the former CEO of Peugeot and Citroën who also led the successful turnaround of Lotus as CEO between 2014 and 2018 - has transformed the fortunes of Wrightbus. When he joined the company, it was producing eight vehicles a week and employed 1,000 people. In 2024, Wrightbus will double its head count as it has upped production to 22 buses a week.

This will rise even further to 26 buses a week in 2025, Gales said. ""A year ago, we had 200 zero emission buses on the road, now we have 700. In a year it's going to be 1,700.""

The company was ranked 74th in this year's Growth Index of the UK's 100 fastest growing businesses.

Electric battery buses (BEVs) currently make up 80% of Wrightbus sales. But the company is banking heavily on the future of hydrogen for the public transport sector. Gales reckons that its hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which accounted for 10% of sales in 2023, will make up 15% of the order book in 2024 and may even rise to 25% in 2026.

Owner Jo Bamford, who purchased the flailing bus maker in 2019, was called ""one of the great advocates for the future of hydrogen in British industry"" by The Times in a profile in April.

Gales, though, has his sights set on Europe and the company has already scored some significant sales in Germany in 2024. Backed by heavy subsidies from the federal government, cities like Cologne and Cottbus have been ordering hydrogen buses from the Northern Irish vehicle maker.

Closer to Gales's native Luxembourg, Saarbrücken's Saarbahn public transport operator in February placed an order for 28 for Kite Hydroliner single decker buses with the Ballymena factory, the first five of which will be delivered this year.

The German government's launch of a €350 million scheme to support the production of renewable hydrogen is encouraging and Wrightbus has recently opened an after-sales service centre in Cologne to handle its rising business in Germany.

Gales is keen to build on the success in Germany and enter other EU markets. ""We have already hired a key account manager for France, and we will do the same for the Benelux,"" he said. Austria and Switzerland are also a target, and Gales has said that an import agent for Italy has also been announced.

Further afield, the company is also going to revamp its Malaysian factory base to boost sales in Hong Kong and Singapore next year, and as a launchpad to make inroads into the Australian and New Zealand markets.

A manufacturing facility in Europe has not been ruled out, but for the moment Gales says that Wrightbus's location in Northern Ireland, which enjoys unfettered access to both the UK and EU markets, is ideal.

Zero emissions initiatives should start with public transport, Gales said. ""It's the easiest thing to do. Replacing a fossil fuel bus with an electric or hydrogen bus takes 40,000 litres of diesel off the road.""

But the CEO also warns of the danger in relying too much on electric vehicles. ""Energy grids are finite, and they are overloaded. We are putting all our eggs into one basket with electric transport, and we just don't have the capacity to meet that demand,"" he said. He also warned that Europe has limited access to battery cells, which are currently primarily made in China

Hydrogen, on the other hand can be stored and transported to where it is needed. What's more, FCEVs, working on what is termed a close-loop principle, always return to their depot to refuel, so the need for widespread charging infrastructure is kept to a minimum, he claims. They can also be charged much faster than current electric battery vehicles.

But the head of the Luxembourg City bus service (AVL) remains unconvinced by the appeal of hydrogen buses. Given the technology, the current market and the cost involved, the chances of hydrogen in the AVL's future is minimal, Lex Bentner told the Luxembourg Times.

""The efficiency of hydrogen buses is worse than diesel buses; that is under 35%,"" Bentner said. ""Whereas the efficiency of battery electric vehicles is around 90%.""

Patrick Goldschmidt, the alderman in charge of transport, has previously said that the capital city is focused on completing the transformation of its bus fleet to being 100% electric by 2025.

The national government also intends to replace the CFL's diesel bus fleet with electric buses by 2030 and set up new charging facilities for electric buses. The Ministry of Transport also cited lower initial purchase prices and operating costs for BEVs [battery electric buses] over FCEVs as the reason for this.

And the European Commission contributed €35 million to converting Luxembourg's RGTR cross-country bus network to an electric fleet as part of subsidies paid in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic

In the longer term, wherever battery electric vehicles are not feasible, the government's strategy does forecast certain volumes of hydrogen that will be needed, the Ministry of Transport told the Luxembourg Times. ""Certain routes may require longer ranges, or a swift refuelling,"" a ministry spokesperson said.

But the availability of green hydrogen - that is produced via electrolysis using electricity from renewable sources - is a problem, said Bentner ""In addition, you also have to invest in a gas station with reservoirs on site, which is technically much more complex than a pure charging station for batteries,"" the AVL boss explained.

A Eurac Research Institute for Renewable Energy study in the autumn of 2023 also found that FCEV operating costs are 2.3 times higher than those of BEVs.

Then there is the cost of the vehicles themselves, argues Bentner. Hydrogen buses are almost double the price of conventional diesel buses and almost a third as expensive again as battery electric buses.

Prices will come down with an increase in demand and the development of new technologies, Gales said. Suppliers of hydrogen cell batteries have been telling the Luxembourger that they will halve the price of their batteries next by 2026 and halve that again by 2028.",luxtimes.lu,news,Luxembourg Times,,0.2470588235294118,454826210,1,https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/fgzjac-jean-marc-gales-1.jpg/alternates/BASE_SIXTEEN_NINE/jean-marc%20Gales%201.jpg,

This project aims to export green hydrogen to Central Europe through pipelines.

The H2 Notos project plans to produce green hydrogen using electrolysers powered by large onshore wind and solar projects, supplied with desalinated sea water. In its initial phase, the project aims to produce 200,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, with the potential to scale up to one million tons per year in South Tunisia. The hydrogen will be transported to the European market via the ""SoutH2 Corridor,"" a pipeline connecting North Africa to Italy, Austria, and Germany, expected to be operational around 2030.

TE H2 and VERBUND will lead the development, financing, construction, and operation of the integrated project, covering green electricity production to green hydrogen production. VERBUND will also manage the transport of the produced hydrogen to Central Europe.

David Corchia, CEO of TE H2, emphasized the significance of this agreement: ""The signing of this MoU with the Republic of Tunisia marks the actual start of this highly ambitious project after months of work and interactions with all stakeholders. Partnering with VERBUND, we aim to support the development of this pioneering endeavor in a strategic location. H2 Notos has the potential to become a significant supplier of green hydrogen for Europe while creating substantial jobs in Tunisia. We are now entering a phase of greenfield development and major technical work to assess the project's feasibility and will deepen our collaboration with national and local authorities.""

Tunisia's Minister of Industry, Mines, and Energy, Fatma Thabet Chiboub, stated: ""This agreement with TE H2 and VERBUND marks a significant step forward in our quest for clean, sustainable energy. Tunisia, firmly committed to its energy transition, sees in this project a strategic pivot to attract foreign investment in renewable energies.""

Michael Strugl, CEO of VERBUND AG, highlighted Tunisia's importance in the green hydrogen supply chain: ""Tunisia is a particularly important upstream region in terms of scalability and competitiveness, and a significant part of VERBUND's hydrogen plans. By combining competitive hydrogen production in Tunisia and pipeline-based transportation, we can ensure a long-term supply at scale, supporting a sustainable transition for our customers to green hydrogen and fostering sustainable economic development in Tunisia. We are delighted to be working with a strong consortium and look forward to collaborating closely with the Tunisian authorities and population.""

Through hard work and dedication Schwarzenegger achieved everything he's set his mind to in his 76 years to date, from bodybuilding greatness to becoming a movie icon to being elected the governor of California.

Fans worldwide, of course, best know Schwarzenegger for his dozens of movie roles, including the 1977 documentary Pumping Iron. Thanks to early to mid-1980s films like Conan The Barbarian and its sequel, The Terminator and Commando, Schwarzenegger quickly became a bona fide action movie star whose career only got bigger as the decade unfolded.

Schwarzenegger finished out the decade with more action films like Predator and The Running Man but added a comedy wrinkle to his acting resume when he paired with longtime pal Danny DeVito on the 1998 classic Twins.

In the 1990s, Schwarzenegger hopped back and forth from action to the comedy space with high-energy films like Total Recall, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and True Lies, which were balanced by such lighthearted fare as Kindergarten Cop (""It's not a tooma!"" he famously yells) and Jingle All the Way.

Continuing with his film career in the 2000s, Schwarzenegger has appeared in more Terminator films and even teamed with his one-time action hero rival Sylvester Stallone in the Rocky legend's Escape Plan. In the second and third chapters of Stallone's Expendables movie series, Schwarzenegger even employed his gift for comedy with classic lines like, ""Get to the choppa!""

During his busy career as an athlete, actor and politician, Schwarzenegger has made several notable TV appearances that have utilized his skills as both an action and comedy movie star. Here's a look at 10 of them.

Arnold Schwarzenegger was seven years into his acting career -- which began with the 1970 movie Hercules in New York -- before he made his TV acting debut. It came in the May 5, 1977, episode in the final season of the classic police procedural The Streets of San Francisco opposite Karl Malden and Richard Hatch, since Michael Douglas left the series the year before.

In the episode Dead Lift, Schwarzenegger appropriately plays a bodybuilder named Josef Schmitt. Josef, however, uses a performance-enhancing drug that exacerbates his temper problem and leads to a murder.

On December 11, 1985, Arnold Schwarzenegger lent his celebrity to a techno jazz-infused music video sponsored by the White House and President Ronald Reagan's administration to warn people of the dangers of drug use. The We Are the World-type of video featured a wide array of hit entertainers in the day from the singing group New Edition and jazz trumpeter Herb Alpert to LA Lakers legend Kareem Abdul Jabbar and actor David Hasselhoff

Schwarzenegger only appears briefly in the Stop the Madness music video as a hard hat-wearing utility worker who flashes a smile at the camera.

While famous actors in recent years have appeared in U.S. TV commercials, many have gladly lent their talents to commercials internationally for decades.

One of them was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who in 1991 appeared in a TV spot in Japan for Nissin Cup Noodle. The spot, naturally, plays up Schwarzenegger's strongman persona, where he pounds a huge mound of dough into noodle form. Schwarzenegger doesn't speak in the spot but he ends it by consuming a cup of noodles.

Grateful to the opportunities he received after moving to the U.S. in 1968, he made a pledge to serve the citizens of his adopted home state of California and won the governorship over incumbent Governor Gray Davis in an October 7, 2003, recall election.

In a televised speech after his victory, Schwarzenegger said of the tough choices ahead (via The Associated Press), ""The first choice is the one that must determine our success. Shall we rebuild our state together or shall we fight amongst ourselves [and] create an even deeper division and fail the people of California? Well, let me tell you something. The answer is clear: 'For the people to win, politics as usual must lose.""

Schwarzenegger was reelected to his second and mandated final term as governor of California in 2006 and returned to acting in January 2011.

People capture celebrities on their cell cameras all of the time, but a video captured by YouTuber Beerdy in 2018 caught Arnold Schwarzenegger in his element at the Muscle Beach Outdoor Gym in Venice, California.

Schwarzenegger -- then 70 -- makes a surprise appearance in the video not only chatting with bodybuilders but pumping iron with them. Although the clip is less than a minute long a lot of YouTube users invested their time in it as the video was viewed 23 million times.

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Salma Hayek brought some electricity to the commercial lineup for the 2022 Super Bowl with a super-charged spot for BMW.

The spot follows Schwarzenegger's Thunder Zeus and Hayek's Goddess Hera as the Greek power couple leaves Mount Olympus for a life of retirement in Palm Springs, California. Zeus becomes frustrated when his powers are trivialized by residents in the community but Hera raises his spirits by buying him a BMW electric car.

The spot concludes with a shot of Zeus and Hera riding in the BMW iX with the Eddie Grant hit Electric Avenue playing over the speakers in their new ride.

May 25, 2023, marked a big first for Arnold Schwarzenegger with the debut of the Netflix original streaming series FUBAR, which holds the distinction of being the actor's first TV series.

FUBAR utilizes Schwarzenegger's two biggest strengths -- his action star acumen and humor -- playing Luke Brenner, a CIA Agent pulled back from retirement to rescue a fellow CIA Agent in another country who happens to be his daughter, Emma Brunner (Monica Barbaro).

The inaugural season's eighth and final episode left viewers with the promise of more FUBAR to come, but there was another Schwarzenegger project waiting in the wings at Netflix.

A mere two weeks after the debut of his TV debut with FUBAR, Arnold Schwarzenegger teamed with Netflix once again for Arnold, a three-part docuseries on the amazing life and career of the global celebrity.

Making its debut on Netflix on June 7, 2023, the Arnold docuseries chronicles three key elements of Schwarzenegger's life. The first episode, Part 1: Athlete, is a deep dive into Schwarzenegger's early life and rise as a bodybuilder, while Part 2: Actor delves into his transition into acting and also keys in on his business acumen. Part 3: American, showcases Schwarzenegger's political career and life and career after.

Several of Schwarzenegger's notable colleagues and former co-stars appear in Arnold, including James Cameron, Jamie Lee Curtis, Linda Hamilton and Danny DeVito.

In arguably one of the best commerical spots to play during the 2024 Super Bowl, State Farm Insurance recruits Arnold Schwarzenegger to star in the action movie Agent State Farm.

The production, however, keeps suffering hiccups because Schwarzenegger with his thick Austrian accent pronunciation of ""neighbor"" comes out as ""neighbaaa."" This, of course, is a problem because the company's slogan is ""Like a Good Neighbor, State Farm is There.""

The Agent State Farm Super Bowl spot not only allows Schwarzenegger to jump back into the action and comedy realm, but it also teams with his longtime friend and colleague Danny DeVito -- which leads to a very funny conclusion to the commercial.

The producers of the 2024 Oscars must have been reminded of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito's magical chemistry with the Agent State Farm ad because they recruited the dynamic duo as a pair of presenters at the Academy Awards.

Schwarzenegger and DeVito engaged in some very entertaining banter before handing out a couple of Oscars, though, as they reminisced how the Dark Knight defeated their villain characters -- Mr. Freeze and the Penguin -- in a pair of Batman movies.

Before too long, DeVito spotted Michael Keaton in the audience, who immediately snapped into his Bruce Wayne-Batman mode to give the stink-eye to the two movie villains. Schwarzenegger responded to Keaton by calling him an SOB -- twice.

Fulfilling fans' wishes, Netflix is bringing back FUBAR for a second season -- and Arnold Schwarzenegger teased how the series is coming back bigger and better than the first time around with a promotional spot from the streamer.

Schwarzenegger isn't alone in the promo, though. Apart from a shoutout about FUBAR Season 2 from co-star Fortune Feimster, Schwarzenegger is accompanied through the spot by his own 5 ½-inch tall action figure. In the spirit of the spot's bigger season promise, the production assembles a massive version of the Schwarzenegger action figure, which stands over 22 feet tall.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.3647058823529412,454795661,1,"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6658c3c9553389b303e53e2f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3510,2095,x489,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds",eng-9605919

Faux private boxes sit onstage for an imaginary audience. Members of the orchestra, donned in traditional chamber music clothes, sit in the pit--sheet music lit both by modern electricity and fake candles. The red velvet curtain hangs closed, and gilded chandeliers glimmer in the light. Once the lights dim, the Spirit (Reese Parish) leaps onstage. With three thumps of her staff, she commands the invisible magic of the theater. The curtains pull back, the chandeliers rise, and a storybook set is conjured, complete with one-dimensional trees and a puppetted dragon.

The magic of ""The Matchbox Magic Flute,"" which runs through June 16, never ceases. Adapted and directed by Mary Zimmerman, this miniature version of Mozart's monumental opera follows the prince Tamino (Billy Rude) and his goofy half-bird sidekick Papageno (Shawn Pfautsch) on their quest to save the princess Pamina (Marlene Fernandez) and find true love.

This new version borrows from the skill set of musical theater. The cast is significantly scaled down: only ten actors, supported by a mighty five-person orchestra, led by Laura Bergquist. Tactics such as double- or even triple-casting, usually impossible in operatic singing because of the strain imposed on the singer's voices, are now utilized because of the more intimate setting. Papageno now has the opportunity to improv a monologue, truly connecting with the audience in the spirit of how the original librettist Schikaneder most likely chatted with attendants each night. The mostly sung-through story interspersed with a few scenes is not minimized as a result of this miniaturization, though. Instead, every unique detail becomes even more amplified and resonant.

While retaining the traditional, extremely technical Queen of the Night arias and Papageno Papagena duet, this adaptation infuses the opera with modern humor. After all, what's Washington, D.C., regional theater without insurrection and lawyer jokes? The translation of the libretto and book from Italian allowed Zimmerman the agency to incorporate English-specific jokes, such as the ""Papageno ratatouille"" and the punnings of ""paralegal,"" ""legal"" and ""eagle."" During dance scenes, the woodland Ladies and members of Sarastro's court could be seen flossing, popping and locking, and doing the good old water sprinkler dance.

Though all the scenes were visually stunning, one scene in particular sizzled with electricity. With a rumble of thunder, the sunny forest scene dissolved as the background periaktos turned into dark ominous clouds. From the ceiling, The Queen of the Night (Emily Rohm), resplendent in a black and red ball gown, floated down with a soprano voice as furious and piercing as lightning.

Do not hesitate to go see the last few remaining performances of this truly dazzling fusion of both musical and opera.",georgetowner.com,news,The Georgetowner,,0.05882352941176472,454779066,3,https://georgetowner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MagicFlute_55.jpg,

Grow Lights Market Report Scope:

The hardware segment currently leads the grow lights market and is expected to have the largest market share in the forecast period.

Grow lights serve as supplemental lighting for indoor cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. The adjustment of bulb types, electrical power, and the distance between the lamp and the plant varies accordingly. The grow light system comprises hardware components such as bulbs, fixtures, metal reflectors, reflective films, and ballasts.

Reflectors play a pivotal role in distributing adequate light to all plants, optimizing light efficiency in indoor horticulture. They help maintain optimal light levels and prevent excessive heat or cold. Available in various types, shapes, and sizes, reflectors are mounted on lamps to reduce energy requirements. Reflective films, lining walls, floors, and ceilings in farms, enhance reflectivity and prevent energy wastage.

Ballasts are electronic devices essential for powering high intensity grow lights. Their primary functions include lamp initiation and operation control. Ballasts convert electricity into precise currents required for lamp operation, ensuring constant light output, and preventing overheating or lamp burnouts. They maintain optimal light temperatures for indoor farming.

Bulbs and fixtures are vital hardware components responsible for energy conservation. Most edible plants require a minimum of 30 watts per square foot, while fruiting species like tomatoes may need 40 to 50 watts per square foot. Due to their superior energy efficiency, full-spectrum LED bulbs and fixtures are increasingly favored by growers.

In June 2023, ams-OSRAM AG introduced the fifth generation of its OSLON Square Hyper Red horticulture LED, aimed at accelerating plant growth and facilitating optimized system costs. This iteration reflects the company's commitment to innovation driven by customer feedback, offering LED solutions with increased photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) and higher efficacy compared to the previous Hyper Red 660?nm LEDs. The new OSLON Square Hyper Red LED is suitable for various horticultural lighting applications, including greenhouse top lighting and interlighting, sole source lighting, and vertical farming.

In March 2022, MegaDrive Vertical Series from California LightWorks, was designed for indoor cultivation across multiple levels. This series combines the MegaDrive central power supply with vertical LED fixtures, offering a cost-effective solution for multi-level shelves and low ceiling grow rooms. By eliminating the need for drivers and reducing power drops, it optimizes control and minimizes installation costs.

>=300 Watts grow lights is predicted to register the highest CAGR in the forecast period.

Grow lights with >=300 watts are well-suited for various grow rooms, particularly those requiring precise care and focused light without causing tent overheating. These lights provide a full spectrum of illumination, safe for all plant growth stages. Covering an area of approximately 4×4 square meters and reaching a height of about 6.5 feet, they deliver a broad range of light that stimulates photosynthesis consistently, promoting rapid plant growth. Equipped with high-quality fans and aluminum heat sinks, these lights ensure efficient heat dissipation and prolonged lifespan.

Market leaders such as Signify Holding, ams-OSRAM AG, Gavita International B.V., Heliospectra, and California LightWorks offer grow lights exceeding 300 watts. Signify Holding, for instance, introduced the innovative Philips GreenPower LED production module 3.0, ranging from 49 to 635 watts, designed to assist growers in optimizing multilayer crop cultivation. This module enables growers to easily adjust the color spectrum to meet the specific needs of various crops and growth phases, including lettuce, leafy greens, herbs, soft fruits, and young plants.

After months of planning, you've just arrived at your luxurious hotel in a scenic European destination. It's all you've hoped for -- a beautiful setting, cozy bed with soft linens, excellent service, fine dining, a high-end spa, outdoor activities, expansive grounds. What you didn't realize is that the hotel you've chosen may be contributing to global warming, hurting the local economy, damaging the ecological balance of the region, exposing guests to a toxic environment, adding to the overflowing landfill, and serving food filled with artificial additives. Booking a hotel that is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable is easy, but there is far more at stake.

According to the World Sustainable Hospitality Alliance, the hospitality industry contributes one percent of global carbon emissions, can use up to eight times more water per person than the local community, and is a primary consumer of single-use plastics. And according to thinkbefore.eu, products that are used as part of hotel operations can pose potential hazards to human health.

You can protect yourself, the planet, and the local residents by staying at a sustainability-focused hotel. There are a number of hotels in Europe that are certified as BIO HOTELS®. These 100 percent organic establishments feature innovative architectural designs, farm-to-table dining, sustainable recreation, eco-conscious amenities, and green electricity. They are are not just places to rest one's head but are pioneers in the hospitality industry - redefining luxury and comfort with a commitment to environmental conservation and community engagement and support.

According to a report by Future Marketing Insights, increased awareness about sustainability among the younger generation is expected to drive the global tourism market, which is estimated to reach a net revenue of nearly $13 million, with green tourism forecast to capture 35.7 percent of the total market revenue in 2024. A recent Virtuoso sustainability survey also reports that ""45 percent of respondents agree that traveling sustainably enhances their experience.""

It's no wonder that BIO HOTELs, such as Land Gut Höhne in Germany, have committed to practices and amenities that include using natural building materials, separating waste, offering electric car charging stations, and implementing sustainable energy practices.

In addition to the 44 certified BIO HOTELS (as well as home rentals), there are also numerous other European resorts that are supporting sustainable tourism while providing guests with a remarkable experience.

The 400-year-old Stanglwirt in Kitzbühel, Austria is a luxury hotel-meets-organic farm type of property that includes a children's farm and pools, a biomass power plant, the largest salt water pool in Europe, antibacterial floors, and five types of sauna. Visitors at this five-star resort can focus on their wellness while enjoying views of the picturesque Kaiser Mountains, drinking pristine water from the Kaiser spring, dining on dairy products produced from the on-property farm, and indulging in a treatment at the family-friendly spa. Owner Balthasar Hauser says, ""Our family knows that this place is a center of natural power. Our values, our traditions, our family history - our whole world is reflected in every corner.""

Another five-star eco-property is the newly opened opulent Hotel Maria in Helsinki, Finland that minimizes their environmental impact through reducing energy and water consumption, monitoring food waste, supporting local suppliers, and featuring seasonal, organic produce. They have been awarded with a Green Key certificate for their sustainability efforts. The hotel is housed in restored historical buildings that are protected by the Finnish Heritage agency. General manager Katriina Moksi told greenlodgingnews that ""In selecting partners and making purchases, we always consider various aspects of sustainability, and we are pleased to be generating an increased demand for high-quality, sustainably produced local goods and services in Finland.""

On Loch Lomond in Scotland, guests of the Cameron House can enjoy the natural beauty surrounding the property, view Eurasian otters and red squirrels, see the Hobbit House in the Enchanted Forest, explore Trossachs National Park, play golf on an 18-hole championship course, visit the spa's rasul mud chamber, or meander through a field of wildflowers in the Untidy Garden. The resort was recently awarded a silver designation at the Greengage Awards for their aggressive land management, rewilding, and carbon reduction efforts.

With a focus on nature, the luxurious Cali Mykonos in Greece implements responsible practices through initiatives such as using sustainably sourced building materials, preserving fresh water by having seawater swimming pools, providing insulation through green roofs, and honoring local history and culture. Enjoy an endless summer on this sun-soaked island at a hotel that is flooded with natural light, features art and furniture from local purveyors, and was built with materials that reflect the surrounding landscape.

There are several resources available to find a hotel that aligns with sustainability values but doesn't sacrifice comfort or luxury. In addition to the 50 listings on the BIO HOTELS website, you can also book certified sustainable hotels through online travel agencies recommended by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council. Beyond Green is another place to search for hotels that are striving to protect the planet while providing meaningful experiences.

In recent years, TECNALIA has been working on a technological solution based on decentralised heat pumps for the refurbishment of the energy system of buildings. It is a concept based on cascade heat pumps, which are hybridised with locally produced renewable energy, mainly solar. Heat for heating and DHW services is generated in two stages:

This solution, developed in the framework of the European HAPPENING project, enables a considerable fraction of renewable energy. The technological solution is coupled with virtually no planning, implementation and operation processes, which ensures a quality installation and reduces the effort required and costs of the renovation project.

Buildings currently account for 40% of the demand for energy and 36% of CO2 in Europe. This demand mainly stems from heating, cooling and DHW systems.

In this context, heat pumps are a key technology when it comes to introducing renewables into the heat supply of buildings, especially in combination with onsite renewable electricity production, e.g. photovoltaic energy.

The solutions developed as part of the HAPPENING initiative have been tested in three real use cases, in buildings in Pasaia (Gipuzkoa), Italy and Austria. With this new system, the self-sufficiency of the building has been maximised, residents have saved money on their energy bills, and the environmental impact has been reduced.

Several European organisations have collaborated with the HAPPENING project: TECNALIA, Accademia Europea di Bolzano (EURAC), Tecnozenith, Innova SRL, AEE - Institut für nachhaltige technologien, GWS, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, RINA Consulting S.p.A, Green Building Council-España, Asociación Nacional de Empresas de Servicios Energéticos (ANESE), CARTIF, ALOKABIDE.

On 14 June, TECNALIA will be holding a conference in Donostia/San Sebastián to present solutions for the electrification of heating and cooling in buildings installed in real cases, both in single-family houses and in blocks of flats, and in new-builds and refurbishments.

This event will cover the entire heat pump value chain, from the manufacturer, installation and maintenance, to the end user.",tecnalia.com,news,Tecnalia,,0.2313725490196079,454770214,1,https://cms.tecnalia.com/uploads/2024/05/desarbonizacion-energia-edificios.jpg,

According to energy sector experts, although a significant dent has been made from the REPowerEU plan, more yet is needed, Yusuf Latief reports.

It's been little over two years since the European Commission adopted the REPowerEU plan - the Union's bid to distance itself from Russian gas in the wake of the war in Ukraine.

And as with any anniversary, it becomes poignant to review. In Brescia, Italy, heat pump manufacturer Turboden and regional industrial association Confindustria Brescia did just that.

A conference gathered heating and cooling sector experts to discuss progress and the overall impression was: significant progress has been made... but more is needed.

""We have significantly reduced gas imports from Russia much faster than we have expected and we've also managed to accelerate the rollout of heat pumps in the REPowerEU plan in the first three years, well over five million units were installed in Europe,"" said Hans Rhein, CINEA's Head of Unit for the LIFE programme.

""The REPowerEU plan has also really been a key driver to accelerate the pace of the Green Deal and the pace of the decarbonisation of the European economy.""

Indeed, when announced back in February 2022, the plan was welcomed both as a well-timed response to the Russian-sparked energy crisis while also ticking the box of promoting renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures.

Have you read:

Call for action on heating and cooling in Europe

Landmark talks to decarbonise heating and cooling held in Brescia

A call for implementation

Specifically, REPowerEU calls for frontloading investments in renewables and energy efficiency, aiming to reduce fossil fuel imports, double the deployment rates of heat pumps in buildings and speed up deployment of large district heating and cooling network heat pumps.

""This is very important - setting new targets and additional targets in our green transition. And heating and cooling is probably the largest consumer of energy in the EU, with about 50% of energy consumed.

""The building sector alone consumes approxiately 40% of energy - that's an important source of emissions and we need really to work on this area to achieve our 2030 and 2050 targets,"" added Rhein, who said that although progress has been seen, more implementation is needed.

""In the last five years the legislative framework has been set to achieve the Green Deal targets. Now is really the time for implementation and it will be a challenging time for heating and cooling.""

Adding urgency to his sentiment, Rhein cited data showing that we are already poised to surpass the 1.5 degree Celsius target and that in Europe, ""the environment is heating up much faster that the rest of the world.""

Thus, ""in Europe, we have a particular interest to accelerate our green transition and to remain the front runners.""

Over 130GW in renewables deployed

Prior to the event in Brescia, Kadri Simson in a release noted valuable milestones of the REPowerEU plan.

According to the European Commissioner for Energy, over the last two years ago, there has deployment of 130GW of renewable energy, or 24bcm.

Said Simson: ""Last year, Europe generated more electricity from wind than from gas, as wind power grew by a record 55TWh from 2022 levels.

""Results are even more telling when you look back to the start of the mandate. Solar installation volumes soared from 16.8GW in 2019 to 55.9GW last year. The renewables increase was especially visible in the electricity sector.

""Here the share of renewables in the electricity generation mix jumped from 30% in 2019 to 38% in 2022 and to more than 40% last year.

""Biogas and biomethane production are on the rise everywhere in Europe. Renewables, with their low cost, and storage, by reducing energy waste, have contributed to bringing electricity prices back to pre-war levels.""

Avoiding siloes

Of course, more is needed and according to Maria Velkova of DG CLIMA, key to ensuring Rhein's called on implementation will be to avoid working in siloes.

Velkova, who is Deputy Head of Unit for Research and Low Carbon Technology Development, addressed attendees during the conference in Brescia - consisting of project developers and other sector stakeholders - encouraging them to share and collaborate.

""You're involved in many different types of projects, developing technologies, best practices, strategies and all these are important.

""With these knowledge sharing events, we hope to speed up the transition to reduce the cost, because there's no point that everybody works on their own and struggles with the same type of barriers.

""Whether you're installing renewable energy or heat pumps, here in Italy, Austria or in Sweden, there are many things that can happen in the same way and with the same type of barriers.""

Said Simson: ""We have halved our energy import bill - and I truly believe we will never again be vulnerable to energy blackmail by Russia.

""Together, we need to tell this story loud and clear. Renewables are at the heart of REPowerEU and are Europe's energy future.""",powerengineeringint.com,news,Power Engineering International,Yusuf Latief,0.1058823529411765,454760698,6,https://www.powerengineeringint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rhein-1.jpg,

Financing hydrogen production in Emerging Markets and Developing Countries (EMDC) is an even bigger one, yet vitally important for supplying richer nations with hydrogen while creating new industries in the EMDC. This month, the World Bank Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) together with the Government of the Netherlands and Invest International organised a Financing Forum during the World Hydrogen summit in Rotterdam. The Forum brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including project developers, development financing institutions, commercial banks, and investors. Carolina Lopez Rocha, Dolf Gielen and Chandrasekar Govindarajalu at the World Bank Group summarise the insights and conclusions of the discussions. They look at the risks and risk mitigation strategies essential for financing hydrogen projects. Governments, investors, banks and insurers all have a role to play, as do the wide range of tools available to them from incentives and subsidies through to concessionary financing. Some lessons can be learned from the European and H2Global auction schemes, but risks are much higher for EMDC. And unanswered questions still remain (e.g. will genuine demand going forward match hydrogen production ambitions), adding to the risks. It's why the World Bank has created the ""10 GW Lighthouse Initiative"" to drive progress in renewable hydrogen project development in EMDC, say the authors.

World Bank, OECD, Hydrogen Council and Global Infrastructure Facility highlighted in their joint report Scaling Hydrogen Financing for Development a pressing issue: Emerging Markets and Developing Countries (EMDC) need approximately US$ 100 billion annually for hydrogen investments between now and 2030. Around half of that amount is for renewable power generation. Electrolysers, downstream processing and enabling infrastructure account for the remainder.

Despite the growing recognition of the clean hydrogen potential to help achieve Paris targets, the current investment levels are far below what is required. BNEF has calculated that out of total global energy transition investments of US$ 1,769 billion, clean hydrogen investments amounted to US$10.4 billion in 2023, primarily in USA, Europe and China. Inclusion of the renewable energy component for hydrogen production could triple this figure but it is still a small share of total energy transition investments and an order of magnitude below EMDC investment needs. Thus, investment volumes fall short.

Clean hydrogen can be categorised into two main types: low-carbon hydrogen and renewable hydrogen. Low-carbon hydrogen is produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS), whereas renewable hydrogen is produced from water electrolysis using renewable power sources like wind or solar energy. It is expected that renewable hydrogen will account for the major share. However, despite its environmental benefits, renewable hydrogen remains more expensive to produce than conventional hydrogen. This cost disparity poses a significant challenge for its widespread adoption and underscores the need for innovative financing solutions.

The production costs are determined by the capital intensity of the projects and the cost of financing. Our rule-of-thumb is 1-10-20-30: a million tonne per year of renewable hydrogen production capacity requires 10 GW electrolysers capacity, 20 GW renewable power and US$ 30 billion of investments.

Developing quality projects takes time. This was discussed in the forum. For example, the selected bidders participating in the H2Global's pilot tender asked for more time than originally anticipated to submit their final bids. The quality and maturity of today's projects varies widely, and this impacts the speed at which renewable hydrogen can be rolled out.

The production cost of renewable hydrogen is a critical factor in its economic viability. Currently, the production cost stands at around US$3 per kilogram in the very best locations, which is three times the cost of conventional hydrogen production in good locations.

Average cost are considerably higher, as witnessed by the recent European auction results with LCOH of 5.3 to 5.8 EUR/kg (6 US$/kg) in Greece, Sweden and Spain and 11 to 13.5 EUR/kg (12 US$/kg) in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany and Poland. The competitiveness of renewable hydrogen varies widely by country and even by location and it is influenced by factors such as natural gas prices and the availability of subsidies.

Conventional hydrogen production costs are determined by the natural gas price. Whereas natural gas feedstock costs 2 USD/GJ in the USA, the price is 8-15 USD/GJ in Europe or Japan. The geographical spread of successful European offers in the recent Hydrogen Bank auction reflects the importance of renewable resource quality for the production cost.

Also, subsidies and tax breaks can impact the project economics and production cost of renewable hydrogen substantially. In the US up to 3 US$/kg tax breaks will be provided for renewable hydrogen production, though the specific rules that apply are still debated. Globally around US$ 350 billion in hydrogen subsidies have been announced, according to BNEF. These subsidies are dominated by OECD countries and China.

Other EMDC do not have the same budgetary space. It is therefore no surprise that EMDC projects with Final Investment Decision (FID) account for less than 1 Mt annual production (Figure 1). According to the Hydrogen Council and McKinsey, 234 projects are in preparation in EMDCs, with LAC leading, followed by MENA, China, Africa and India. The size and the project types vary widely.

Policies and regulations can impact the project investment needs. For example, hourly matching of renewable power supply and electrolysers operation requires the deployment of a mix of renewables including more costly supply options and possibly investments in electricity storage, or it can impact the number of operating hours of the electrolysers. Spatial matching of renewable power generation and electrolysis may require investments into more costly supply options. For example, offshore wind is twice as expensive as onshore wind, and onshore wind in good locations is again twice as expensive as solar PV per kWh of electricity produced. Further amendments and clarifications to the rules and regulations could improve uptake.

Technology cost reduction will be critical to reduce hydrogen production cost. Chinese alkaline electrolysers sell at 962-1113 USD/1000 m3 (around 200 US/kW), PEM at roughly three times that price. Comparable uninstalled US PEM price is currently US$ 1000/kW, twice as much for installed systems. In the current geopolitical climate such differences may give rise to protectionism as countries vie for manufacturing market share. However innovation is another way to close the cost cap and accelerate renewable hydrogen deployment. The US government plans to drive the cost of PEM electrolysers to a quarter of their current cost within two years, targeting an uninstalled capital cost of US$250/kW for PEM by 2026 and US$100/kW by 2029-2036.

Renewable power costs determine renewable hydrogen costs. The capital intensity of wind and solar in combination with increasing financing costs have increased Power Purchasing Agreement prices in recent years. Whereas wind has seen significant cost increases as basic materials such as steel have increased in price, the cost of solar PV panels has continued to fall. In quarter one of 2024, PPA prices in Europe declined again by 5%. Further cost reductions will be critical. Falling electrolyser cost may allow in the future a daytime only operation mode so low-cost solar PV can become the main energy source. Limited opportunities exist elsewhere to deploy low-cost surplus hydropower, for example in the case of Paraguay.

In conclusion a wait-and-see approach will not get us the hydrogen deployment that we need. We also need learning-by-doing, which requires active support for initial projects and upscaling. And we need continued innovation to drive down technology costs.

Renewable hydrogen projects are very capital intensive and have limited operating costs (if the renewable power supply is included in the project scope). The high CAPEX results in large upfront financing needs. As a consequence, the cost of financing is a critical factor that has a large impact on the production cost. The following discussion will focus on this specific factor.

Two types of projects can be identified: those that are on the books of large companies (corporate financing) and those that deploy a special purpose vehicle (SPV). An SPV is a subsidiary created by a parent company to isolate financial risk. This structure is widely used for energy projects and is considered the preferred approach for hydrogen projects. SPV's economic and financial viability depends on the revenue stream and the offtake contract is therefore critical. However, SPVs require higher returns due to the perceived risks including those associated with new technologies and the nascent hydrogen sector.

Any new technology is considered risky and therefore faces elevated cost of financing. This is reflected in the debt-equity ratio that tends to be lower for new technologies. Whereas a solar PV project may be financed with 90% debt and 10% equity, a hydrogen project may require a 60% debt and 40% equity ratio. Equity is considerably more expensive than debt because of the elevated risk in terms of variable returns and the potential loss of the invested funds in case of default. Yet a minimum share of equity is determined by the project capability to meet debt servicing requirements from the revenue stream. In a developing country context debt may be priced at 8-10% while equity is priced at twice the price at 15-20%. A much higher cost of debt can occur in case of economic or political instability: the yield on sovereign bonds - generally seen as a lower bound for the cost of debt - can rise to 50% in countries that face a financial crisis.

Risks can be split into country specific risks common to all large infrastructure projects in EMDC and unique hydrogen specific risks. A renewable hydrogen project is especially sensitive to country risk because of its capital intensity. Once a hydrogen project is established, it is very costly to walk away or stop operating. The sensitivity to country specific risk factors is thus high. Guarantees can be deployed to reduce country risks. This is a well-established practice in other sectors.

Most early hydrogen projects have some kind of government involvement. EMDC government loan default rates have mostly been in the range of 2-4%, indicating the risks of lending to emerging markets are low. Moreover, recovery rates for private lenders in case of default were 74.7% between 1994 and 2022.

Most of the residual risks beyond the overall country risk are policy derived. Governments can mitigate such risks, using concessional financing or budget resources, through offtake agreements, demand guarantees, regulatory policy guarantees etc. But the prevalence of such structures is rare. A key explanation is that the guarantee needed to leverage the private sector is expensive.

Several risks influence the cost of capital for clean hydrogen projects. These specific risks centre on engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) overruns, offtake default, technology nonperformance, withdrawal of regulatory incentives, and exchange rates. Implementing cost-effective and efficient de-risking mechanisms could substantially decrease the weighted average cost of capital, making projects economically viable, which will accelerate their deployment and reduce the financing gap.

During the Finance Forum, commercial banks reported their participation in the syndicated loans for NEOM in Saudi Arabia an H2GreenSteel in Sweden, two large renewable hydrogen projects that have reached FID. The syndication spreads out risks allowing a large number of financing institutions to get comfortable with hydrogen projects. The World Bank and OECD have performed a robust market sounding among financiers and developers around the world to map the main risks hindering the financing for clean hydrogen projects in EMDCs. The results show the prevalence of six subcategories of risks. In order of priority: offtake risks stand out, followed by equally weighted political and regulatory risks; infrastructure risks; permitting risks; technology risks; and finally macroeconomic risks. The lower sub-categories of risks are: design, construction and completion risks; operational and maintenance risks; and supply risks. In today's nascent clean hydrogen industry, the degree of a particular project's risk largely depends on the actors involved. Evaluating the credit rating, experience, and credibility of project sponsors, engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors, primary technology providers, and offtakers must feature prominently in any risk assessment. As such, it is critical that EMDC governments select reputable partners.

How risks translate into cost of financing is not entirely clear. Data for individual projects and the risk calculation behind such projects are usually confidential and there is no uniform methodology to assess risk. Financial ratings of companies and countries provide some guidance but are not always available or directly applicable. More transparency regarding financing costs can help to drive costs down.

Risk mitigation mechanisms can help large-scale clean hydrogen projects in EMDC achieve financial viability. Policy de-risking mechanisms aim at removing the root causes of risks through policy measures. They include instruments to support institutional capacity building, local skills development, the implementation of relevant laws, and the management of infrastructure assets. Financial de-risking mechanisms deploy financial measures to avoid or reduce project risk.

Governments of EMDC can collaborate with development finance institutions to devise and implement a wide spectrum of financial de-risking instruments for clean hydrogen projects, tailored to the needs and characteristics of each country. Such instruments include partial credit guarantees, partial risk guarantees, political risk insurance, liquidity reserve accounts, and local currency support.

Export credit agencies have traditionally guaranteed investments abroad and have already played a role in first projects such as NEOM in Saudi Arabia. The Dutch government commented during the Finance Forum that there is an intent to change the Dutch Export Credit Agency (ECA, Atradius) rule so having Netherlands as a target market for exports will be sufficient for the Dutch ECA to cover non-OECD risks.

Also, insurers can provide technology performance insurances and have already done so for electrolysers. They can also insure against natural disasters.

Whereas such guarantees and insurances can help to reduce the financing needs, this is not a panacea. For example, a balance needs to be struck between financing cost reductions and the cost of the risk mitigation instruments. For example, MIGA political risk insurance and credit enhancement for cross-border private sector investors and lenders is particularly relevant for investments in countries with specific credit rating.

Finally, there is a need to consider proper risk allocation. Project partners and stakeholders may play a specific role, for example in terms of offtake risk guarantee, technology performance risk and EPC wrap.

A key insight from the Rotterdam World Hydrogen Summit was that demand falls short. The Hydrogen Council presented that implementation of today's announced incentives will yield 3-7 Mt hydrogen demand while demand side policy targets add up to 27 Mt hydrogen demand. Private sector players commented during the Summit that the realisation of 20 Mt hydrogen demand in Europe seems unlikely. This puts the European 10 Mt import target into jeopardy. Given the preference for low-cost and low-carbon hydrogen in Korea and Japan - ideally from subsidised US production - this raises the question who will buy EMDC renewable hydrogen from projects that target exports.

Whereas focus is on the cost side, the revenue generated is also key for economic performance. This revenue stream depends on the offtake contract. The first European Hydrogen Bank auction has shown impressively that favorable offtake opportunities exist where even today less than 0.5 EUR/kg subsidies are needed for an economically viable project, with total production cost in the 5-6 Euro range. Some parties are thus willing to pay such an elevated price, which may help to get the market going. A recent announcement of an 'ammonia for shipping' project in Namibia illustrates the key importance of this demand sector for EMDC hydrogen development in the coming years.

H2Global has recently received 3.8 billion euros in additional funding from the German and Dutch governments and will soon launch the first results of its pilot auction. The European Hydrogen Bank relies on the member countries to shape and operationalise imports, using instruments such as H2Global.

In conclusion demand policies need to be strengthened in order to realise the desired hydrogen uptake and foster EMDC production.

One solution that is often touted is blended financing. This comes in four blending archetypes:

Concessional financing is anything below market rates. It is often viewed in Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) terms, although IBRD (World Bank financing), which is often labeled non-concessional, is also below market rates.

Yet the Independent Expert Group on Climate Finance concluded that the use of ""blended finance,"" deployed transaction-by-transaction in a bespoke fashion, has not proven scalable so far. Convergence reports that blended financing totals grew to US$15 billion in 2023, reaching a 5-year high. Commercial financing from DFIs/MDBs grew by 140% to US$4.9 billion in 2023. This is complemented with nearly US$1 billion in ODA, including funds channeled through DFI/MDBs. The use of concessional guarantees and risk insurance is on the rise -- the dollar value of concessional guarantees accounted for 43% of all concessional funding in 2023. The energy sector accounts for nearly one third of deal activity and 47% of total blended capital flows. Much of this investment targets renewable energy development.

The OECD applies a broader blended financing definition and reports thus larger sums. According to the OECD, the two leveraging mechanisms (or archetypes) that mobilised the largest volumes of private capital were direct investment in companies and project finance special purpose vehicles (SPVs) (US$13.8 billion) and guarantees (US$9.8 billion). OECD estimated a total of US$61 billion of blended finance as of 2022.

The World Bank has calculated that private sector investments in infrastructure, or private participation in infrastructure (PPI) in EMDC amounted to US$86 billion in 2023. Energy projects represent a large chunk and energy saw a threefold increase in investment levels in 2023. A fifth of the funding came from DFIs (MBDs, bilateral development agencies, ECAs), and 13 percent from public sources.

According to the Independent Expert Group the non-sovereign arms of MDBs, even with the sweeteners of donor-funded concessional finance, only mobilised 64 cents in private finance per dollar of MDB plus concessional commitments. Historically the leverage ratio of transactions is higher (2.5-5.1) when there is market-rate participation from a DFI or MDB. It is therefore evident that DFIs and MDBs, with their limited asset bases, can only drive blended finance growth so much.

Concessional resources should be used only when they create the virtuous cycle, not to ""compensate"" for bad policies. Also the level of concessionality matters. For example, the World Bank Group follows a rigorous model to ensure minimal concessionality, reducing the likelihood of market distortions.

Official non-concessional finance is the engine for scaling up sustainable development investments in middle-income countries. MDBs are the backbone of the non-concessional official financing architecture, accounting for over 60 percent of the system (around US$100 billion per year). Bilateral agencies are also important but in aggregate account for only one quarter of official non-concessional commitments.

The independent expert group called last year for a larger fraction of concessional assistance to be channeled through MDBs. MDBs should provide an incremental US$260 billion of the additional annual official financing, of which $200 billion is non-concessional lending, and help mobilise and catalyse most of the associated private finance. MDB concessional financing should grow from US$30 billion in 2019 to US$90 billion in 2030.

These numbers illustrate that US$ 100 billion annual hydrogen investments require a judicious use of scarce concessional financing, and a well-coordinated approach is needed.

It is clear that there is a need for additional concerted action to enable the proper hydrogen role for EMDC. There was a consensus during the Finance Forum that stakeholders need to cooperate more closely in order to get projects faster to FID. DFIs need to cooperate more closely to mobilise the necessary financing.

Given the finance scarcity and the number of projects in the pipeline, a careful evaluation is needed to identify projects that can reach FID in the coming years, and to design and implement the enabling measures to get them there. This will include the use of various innovative financing instruments. It is critical to learn from best practice, and identify blueprints on how to get there.

The 10 GW Lighthouse initiative, led by the World Bank Group in close cooperation with other Development Financing Institutions, was introduced and discussed during the forum. The goal is to get a significant number of mid-size hydrogen projects in EMDC to FID in the coming years. The proposed steps are illustrated in Figure 2. A similar virtuous cycle has been successfully deployed in the context of the World Bank work in scaling up clean energy to phase down coal.

The journey towards financing hydrogen projects in EMDC is fraught with challenges but also presents significant opportunities. By leveraging innovative financing solutions, de-risking strategies, and international collaboration, it is possible to bridge the financing gap and accelerate the development of clean hydrogen projects.

Fostering mutually beneficial collaboration with local and international partners and promoting knowledge transfer is critical. Better cooperation among MDBs and DFIs can maximise impact, avoid duplication of efforts and ensure complementarity of financial and technical support tools. Establishing partnerships across the entire Power-to-X value chain will accelerate deployment. The 10 GW Lighthouse initiative, along with supportive policies and technological advancements, can play a crucial role in driving the hydrogen economy forward, ensuring that EMDC can participate fully in the global energy transition.",energypost.eu,news,Energy Post,Dolf Gielen,0.05098039215686279,454748637,3,https://energypost.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Energy-Post-180524v6.jpg,eng-9602846

Europe was around seven per cent wetter than average in 2023 - during the world's hottest year on record.

Hot air retains more moisture, which increases precipitation and can cause widespread flooding. One third of rivers across Europe breached a 'high' flood threshold last year, according to the EU climate agency's latest report.

In some areas, fuller rivers strengthened the hand of one renewable: hydropower. Potential for run-of-river hydropower generation was above average across much of Europe for the year as a whole, Copernicus says.

With this form of hydropower, a portion of the river is diverted through a canal or a penstock to spin a turbine and generate electricity.

But does a wetter Europe necessarily lead to more hydropower? Here's what the experts say.

First things first, is Europe's wet weather trend expected to continue?

According to climate scientists, extreme precipitation is set to increase with global warming across most of Europe, except the Mediterranean. There will be more rainfall during northern European winters and less in Mediterranean summers.

This mixed picture emerged last year, with Spain, Portugal and southern France drier than average.

Increased rainfall and flooding is only one consequence of throwing our water cycle into disarray. A 1-in-500 year drought hit Europe in 2022, denting hydropower generation.

Neither extreme is good for run-of-river hydropower. Low flow conditions mean there is too little water to generate sufficient electricity, while flood events risk damaging the equipment.

But, explains Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) scientist Shaun Harrigan, ""in regions and seasons where river flow increases moderately, then there would be increased hydropower generation potential.""

So that could mean more run-of-river hydropower - the kind that is more directly linked to climate variability - in parts of northwest Europe.

Europe's network of hydropower plants delivered 637.23 terawatt hours (TWh) of renewable energy in 2023, according to the International Hydropower Association (IHA). That's enough to cover around 163.4 million European households.

French and Portuguese utility companies Électricité de France (EDF) and Energias de Portugal (EDP) are the ""biggest hitters"" in Europe, while the UK has recently committed to developing more pumped storage hydropower (PSH).

PSH is described as the world's largest battery. It pumps water from a lower source to an upper reservoir and releases it through a turbine during times of high electricity demand. And it's this technology that the industry is investing most of its hopes in.

""The greatest challenges for the European grid are modernisation of [existing] plants and the potential for their conversion into pumped storage facilities to support management of a flexible grid powered by a mixture of hydropower, wind and solar,"" a spokesperson for IHA says.

Although there is some potential left for run-of-river systems, they say, like in the Danube River, the time is ripe for PSH growth. Austria is considered a leader in constructing these water batteries. In Albania, Norwegian energy giant Statkraft is planning to expand its hydropower fleet on the Devoll river cascade, by adding a new PSH facility.

In August last year, days of heavy rain overwhelmed the Braskereidfoss hydroelectric power plant on Norway's mighty Glåma River. Its concrete dam partially collapsed, leading to further flooding and the displacement of some 5,000 people downstream.

But the IHA maintains that hydropower is one of the most climate-resilient forms of electricity.

""In many locations, increased water flow can be better managed through powered infrastructure such as hydropower, thanks to its water retention capabilities,"" an IHA spokesperson tells Euronews Green.

""Not only are most facilities robust for many decades, most dams are built as flood and drought control plus irrigation.""

Modernisation is key, they add, as ""a more flexible plant is a more resilient one.""

In the case of the Norwegian power plant, hatches that were supposed to open automatically if too much water collected behind the dam failed to work as designed.

With climate extremes increasing in such a variable way across Europe, the required upgrades can vary even between the same type of hydropower plants in different countries.

""Modern technologies such as digitalisation, improved forecasting and satellite monitoring, hybridisation and variable speed turbines, will help the sector navigate extreme meteorological conditions,"" the IHA spokesperson explains.

""Facilities equipped with larger reservoirs, capable of storing substantial volumes of water such as reservoir and pumped storage hydropower, will play a crucial role in mitigating the effect of extreme events such as drought and flooding.""

While there might be more potential for 'water batteries', especially in northwest Europe, not everyone is convinced it's the best route to clean energy.

Environmentalists are concerned about the impact of new dams on Europe's waterways, pointing out that the ecosystems it impinges on are not renewable.

""Europe has the most fragmented rivers in the world,"" Claire Baffert, Senior Water Policy Advisor at WWF Europe previously told us, explaining that migratory fish are particularly impacted. ""And this is because of all the dams that have been built for hydropower.""

To help buff the green credentials of hydropower projects, the Hydropower Sustainability Alliance has developed a global certification scheme that the industry can check itself against.

Plans should avoid negative biodiversity impacts, for example, and take water supplies into account.

Even the best-laid plans, however, are being projected into an increasingly unstable future.

""Climate change is having a profound impact on the water cycle,"" C3S scientist Harrigan says.

""While we might be able to limit or even reverse some disruption, some changes might be irreversible - we do not yet fully understand the consequences of pushing the water cycle into unchartered territory.""",euronews.com,news,Euronews English,,0.1058823529411765,454741349,6,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/46/46/50/1200x675_cmsv2_7b1c55e2-ec12-5236-879e-080ad6a9251d-8464650.jpg,

All five are charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes.

The main accusation made by Khan and his team against the two Israelis is that they have used ""starvation as a weapon of war"" by denying Gazans food, water and fuel. Gallant made no secret of Israel's intention when on October 9th, 2023, he announced, ""I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.""

US pressure initially compelled Israel to agree to allow 100 lorry loads of aid to enter Gaza via the Rafah terminal with Egypt although before the war 500 lorry loads of aid and consumer goods had been delivered to Gaza through the Israeli Kerem Abu Salem crossing in southern Gaza. The number has increased over time and Kerem Abu Salem and Rafah crossings were partially operational, but deliveries have been slow and fitful due to obstruction from Israel. Rafah is now closed and Kerem Abu Salem risky due to Israel's military offensive on Rafah. A new crossing at Erez west in the famine-ridden north can handle limited traffic.

While ICJ judges still have to authorise warrants, legal experts argue that Khan would not have made this announcement unless this will happen. He has been criticised as this is the first time he has announced his decision before the warrants have been formally issued. Although his announcement was expected for weeks, it created a furore when he went ahead, detailing the grounds for indicting the men because levelling accusations at the two Israelis has been explosive. Until Khan took this step, Israel's rulers had enjoyed impunity and had been immune from prosecution although they had, legal experts argue, committed war crimes over many decades.

Cautious Khan provided political cover for his initiative by recruiting six international legal experts, including high profile Amal Clooney, to advise his team. Once the warrants are in place, the 124 countries which are party to the Rome statute which created the ICC will be obliged to arrest the five men if they enter these states territory. This will not affect Sinwar or Deif but could limit the travel of Netanyahu and Gallant. Among the signatories of the Rome Statute are 25 European states, including Germany, France, Austria, Ireland, Holland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Britain as well as Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

Khan has been criticised for failing to tackle Israel's leaders earlier for its war on Gaza while he was ready to take action after Russia invaded Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children's Rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova. They were charged with the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia during the war. The warrants, issued a year after the conflict began, were rejected by Putin but commended by the US and Western governments which have armed and funded Ukraine's war effort.

As South Africa is among the 33 signatories from that continent, Putin was asked not to attend a 2023 summit of the BRICS grouping Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

The Russian bombing on May 25th of a DYI (Do It Yourself) store which killed 18 and wounded 48 in a Ukrainian supermarket complex in the city of Kharkiv demonstrates just how different the two situations are. Ukrainians still have supermarkets, money, homes, jobs, food, and gardens to tend. Gazans do not.

There is no comparison between the Ukraine war to the devastation and death Israel has wreaked on Gaza.

According to the most recent data on Ukraine there have been 10,582 deaths and 19,875 wounded, 4 million internally displaced, 1.9 million refugees, and 14 million in need out of 38 million. Ukrainian refugees have been welcomed and subsidised if they settle in European Union countries.

Gaza is an Israeli isolated, besieged and blockaded strip of land along the Medi terranean coast. Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians cannot leave. Some 1.7 million are refugees driven from their homes during Israel's 1948 war of establishment. Refugees live in UNRWA camps and rely on the UN for food, shelter, education, healthcare and employment. Eighty-one per cent of camp dwellers lives below the poverty line. Unemployment is over 50 per cent.

Since Israel launched its war on October 7th, Gaza has become a wasteland. The World Bank reports the level of destruction is ""unprecedented:"" 62 per cent of homes have been destroyed, rendering 1 million homeless; 19 per cent of water, health, and education infrastructure have been destroyed; and nine per cent of commercial and industrial buildings have been levelled. The Bank estimated it would cost more than $18 billion to rebuild. This sum rises day by day.

This is why the ICC and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which called on Israel to halt its Gaza offensive a week ago, should have intervened long before now. After announcing his decision to issue warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, ICC Prosecutor Khan spoke of having to deal with Israel's Western-granted impunity while defending the independence of the court. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Khan said the Gaza situation ""lives on the San Andreas Fault of international politics and strategic interests. And, of course, I've had some elected leaders speak to me who were ...very blunt"". He said that these leaders told him that,"" This court [the ICC] is built for Africa and for thugs like [Vladimir] Putin,"" rather than western leaders, including Israeli figures. Khan insisted, ""Nobody is above the law.""",jordantimes.com,news,Jordan Times,,-0.3647058823529412,454722520,1,,eng-9600101

Green hydrogen will be produced using electrolysers, powered by large onshore wind and solar projects, and supplied with desalinated sea water. The project aims to produce 200,000 tons of green hydrogen annually during its initial phase, with the potential to scale up production to one million tons per year in South Tunisia.

The project will have access to the European market through the SoutH2 Corridor, a hydrogen pipeline project connecting North Africa to Italy, Austria- and Germany, which is expected to be commissioned around 2030.

Importance of Green Hydrogen

Green hydrogen is a clean source of fuel, that is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. This green hydrogen can assist different countries to meet their decarbonization goals. The countries of Europe are also dependent on green hydrogen imports to fulfill their energy transition aspirations.

The green hydrogen production volumes in the European Union countries are expected to be much lower than demand. As a result, this new project of TotalEnergies and its partners can capitalize on the increasing demand for green hydrogen in the countries of Europe.

TotalEnergies Long-Term Plans

TotalEnergies goal is to reach net-zero emission by 2050 and has been expanding its global renewable energy portfolio through solar, wind and power storage. It will continue to expand this renewable energy generation business to reach 35 gigawatts (GW) in 2025 and more than 100 TWh of net electricity production by 2030.

The company is gradually building a portfolio of low-carbon businesses that could account for 15-20% of sales by 2040. TotalEnergies is committed to integration across the entire electricity value chain and has been investing on a regular basis to further expand its portfolio. It will integrate renewable energy and flexible power generation from natural gas and energy storage to meet its objective.

Renewable Usage on the Rise Globally

Per International Energy Agency (IEA), globally, in the next five years, 3,700 GW of new renewable capacity will come online, driven by supportive policies in more than 130 countries. Per IEA, in 2028, renewable energy sources will account for over 42% of global electricity generation.

These projections from IEA indicates a huge growth prospect for companies operating in the clean energy space. Supportive government policies, concern against emission, ongoing research and development leading to usage of new technology, development of utility-scale cost-efficient renewable projects will all contribute to achieve the target.

Clean Energy Producers to Benefit

The rising concern against emission and usage of clean energy will surely benefit the companies that are focused to generate clean energy for their customers. Companies like Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, NextEra Energy NEE and Canadian Solar CSIQ among others are going to produce clean energy and reduce emission levels.

The long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth of Constellation Energy, NextEra Energy and Canadian Solar are currently pinned at 41%, 8% and 25%, respectively.

Constellation Energy, NextEra Energy and Canadian Solar reported average earnings surprise of 49.4%, 8.8% and 58.2%, respectively, in the last four reported quarters.

He was one of the speakers on the panel titled 'Decarbonizing industry and business in response to Green Agenda and carbon pricing' at Belgrade Energy Forum. This year, BEF 2024 gathered a total of 500 participants from 30 countries.

Predojević said Elixir is the leader in the chemical industry in Southeast Europe. The company operates in Serbia in two locations - Elixir Prahovo and Elixir Zorka Šabac. In total, it produces one million tons of mineral fertilizers and phosphoric acid. Its facility in Prahovo is one of the six factories in Europe that make phosphoric acid.

Elixir will install its own batteries

""We are currently in an investment cycle of EUR 300 million, which is named Prahovo 2027 and includes four greenfield investments,"" Predojević said.

The firm intends to invest in a new phosphoric acid plant, in the production of crystalline fertilizers, in the generation of steam from non-recycled waste, and in wind and solar electricity production and energy storage.

Investing in energy should provide the company with energy, but also the possibility to balance its power generation, and prepare for the period after 2026, when the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is kicking off.

""All these investments will also create jobs, about 200 of them, with many positions for engineers,"" Elixir's top official announced.

At the panel on the decarbonization of the industry, Predojević said that the production of mineral fertilizers is another sector that would undergo major changes when the EU starts charging the CBAM carbon border tax.

Elixir started preparing for the changes a few years ago and it regularly reports on CO2 emissions. One of the reasons is that its partners from the EU need the data for their own calculations.

The aim is to set up a major green hydrogen production site in the south of the country.

The aim is to produce 200,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2030 ( i.e. around a quarter of France's annual hydrogen consumption). Ultimately, the group aims to produce 1 million tonnes a year.

Called ""H2 Notos"", the project aims to produce hydrogen through electrolysis (using desalinated seawater), using solar and wind-generated electricity. The hydrogen produced will then be exported from Tunisia to Europe through a pipeline.

A first portion will be specifically built from the production site to the north Tunisian coast. Hydrogen will then be transported via a marine pipeline that currently carries gas. According to David Corchia, Managing Director of TE H2, transport by pipeline is less expensive than a double conversion into ammonia that would require transport by ship. The hydrogen would then transit through the future SoutH2 corridor pipeline, expected to reach Europe via Italy by 2030.

This southern European country is likely to become a major hub for hydrogen imports from Africa. Italy has already signed an agreement with Algeria and is also showing an interest in hydrogen from Morocco.

It is worth noting that this hydrogen could subsequently reach other European countries such as Austria and Germany. While the European Union is aiming for a balanced mix of imports and local production, Germany is clearly banking on imports. In addition to the H2Med Project, the country is signing an increasing number of international agreements, for instance with Canada and Australia.

The multi-billion-dollar project, H2 Notos, aims to produce 200,000 metric tons of hydrogen a year using desalinated water from the Mediterranean and electricity from wind and solar farms in southern Tunisia. A ramp-up to 1 million tons per year is possible.

The hydrogen would be transported to Europe through a 3,300 km (2,050 mile) pipeline connecting Tunisia to Italy and continuing onto Austria and Germany, which is being planned by companies including Snam.

Production could begin as early as 2030, with Verbund taking some of the hydrogen and transporting it throughout Central Europe.

Why it is important?

The European Union aims to produce 10 million tons and import 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 in a bid to replace hydrocarbons, which emit planet-warming gases when burned.

European industrials are already signing hydrogen supply deals and investing to upgrade equipment to run on the green fuel, which emits water when combusted.

""What is notable about this project is its ability to transport low-cost hydrogen directly to Europe via pipeline,"" TEH2 CEO David Corchia said in a media call.

""Pipeline transport adds about 1 euro (USD 1.09) per kilo to the cost, compared with 3.5 to 4 euros per kilo when you transform hydrogen to ammonia, ship it on a boat, and re-crack it back into hydrogen.""

""The Americans are moving but haven't cracked that problem better than we have. They are still transforming it and putting on boats, it's just that they are heavily subsidized,"" Corchia added.

Some are new to the circle, like the recently promoted Portuguese minister Maria Carvalho - previously a lawmaker in the European Parliament's energy and industry committee. But most ministers know each other well after two intense years of tackling the bloc's energy crisis and actioning the EU's ambitious climate plans.

The agenda continues to be dominated by these two big-ticket items: a stock-taking of REPowerEU - the bloc's emergency plan to wean itself off Russian gas - and an assessment of the Green Deal.

While Russian coal has been entirely banished and oil relegated to a few select refineries in Eastern Europe, Russian gas remains dominant in Austria and Hungary while the Kremlin's liquified natural gas continues to arrive in Western European ports.

Berlin and Prague will push for a new high-level group to complete the EU's exit from Russian energy, Reuters reported.

Conflict ahead

The meeting will see the European Commission updating ministers on the 27 national energy and climate plans. Each EU countries must submit its final plans by 30 June and collectively, the documents will give the clearest indication yet as to whether Europe is on track to meet its 2030 climate and renewable objectives.

The plans are also expected to expose divisions within the Council.

France and Czechia lead a 14-strong alliance of pro-nuclear countries pushing for acknowledgment of low-carbon electricity equally to renewable power - and easier access to finance. They face resistence from a pro-renewables 13-country alliance led by Austria and Germany.

A whopping eight points raised by various countries will be up for discussion, a record for the term. EU diplomats attribute it to national capitals jostling to shape the next Commission's priorities.

Saying goodbye to the Belgian presidency

The meeting is the last gathering of energy ministers chaired by Belgium, who expect to conclude their biggest priority for their six-month term: following up on the EU electricity grid plan from late 2023.

The presidency has crafted a document which focuses on closing the grid investment gap, strengthening the electricity system's resilience and increasing the speed and scale of the grid expansion.

Two main barriers must be overcome: ""differences in product specifications"" across EU countries - equipment must often be tailor-made to suit the specificities of EU countries' grids - and speedier permitting.

Earlier this month, the sun unleashed the most powerful streams of plasma, known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), in 20 years, causing communication disruptions worldwide.

The sunspot that caused the chaos has swung back around and released a powerful flare toward Earth's region on Monday . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a 60 percent chance of radio blackouts on Tuesday and throughout the rest of the week.

NOAA issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch on May 11 when the same sunspot was smashing our planet with dozens of energized streams of plasma. A solar or geomagnetic storm is a major disturbance of Earth's magnetosphere - the area around Earth controlled by the planet's magnetic field. NOAA's alert was the first given since 2005 when Earth was hit with the highest dose of radiation in a half-century.

The unusual event earlier this month disrupted GPS, power grids, farming equipment and satellites in orbit - and experts are monitoring Monday's flare in preparation of the same issues. The sunspot, labeled AR3664, has released 17 flares this week, but the strongest has captured attention worldwide. 'I have not seen an explosion like this in my 40 years of observing the sun,' Amateur astronomer Michael Karrer, from Austria told SpaceWeather . 'So fast, so far out into space! It was gigantic,' he said.

Sunspot AR3664 is currently not facing directly at Earth, but data shows it will move in view by the end of the week and could unleash solar storms toward out planet. While the storms are not expected to reach levels seen earlier this month, they are expected to cause a level three (R3) radio blackout that may last from just minutes to hours and affect GPS systems and radio communication. GPS systems are disrupted because the radiation emitted from the solar flare hits the magnetic sphere surrounding Earth, causing fluctuations in the ionosphere.

The ionosphere is a layer in the upper atmosphere that absorbs and reflects signals during geomagnetic storms, causing static and disruptions in the signals received by GPS systems. Auroras are also expected to spread across northeast Canada tonight, although no official forecasts related to the solar storm have been released. The sunspot first ejected solar flares on May 10 before it rotated away, but its reemergence could mean a powerful geo-storm is heading toward earth.

Earlier this month, a powerful G5 solar storm hit earth, marking the largest outburst in 20 years that was expected to collapse US power grids and cause nationwide blackouts. There weren't significant impacts caused by the storm, although some farmers reported they lost access to their GPS systems, forcing them to pause operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that there weren't more severe problems because they were prepared.

""Simply put, the power grid operators have been busy since yesterday working to keep proper, regulated current flowing without disruption,"" Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator for the NOAA told NPR at the time. Other astronomers captured images of the sun emitting the solar flare across the world over the last two days ranging from Arizona, Virginia and countries as far away as Italy and Chile. Scientists have warned that these extreme eruptions could only be the start of more powerful solar flares that could hit Earth next year, causing the worst geo-storm in 165 years.

In 2019, the sun had zero reported visible sunspots on its surface, but the US National Space Weather Prediction Center estimated there could be up to 115 by July 2025. Astronomers worry that another extreme solar flare could mirror the 1859 Carrington Event that set telegraph wires on fire, disrupted ships' compasses and cut off communications worldwide. If an event of that magnitude occurred today, it would have much more widespread implications because of the modern-day reliance on technology for every day operations.

This would mean home medical equipment that requires electricity to function would be rendered useless and without cell phones, there would be no way to call 911 in the case of an emergency. Major geomagnetic storms can also destroy satellites by causing them to crash into other objects in space. The 2022 geomagnetic storm was the last severe storm prior to early May, which destroyed up to 40 Starlink satellites worth more than $50 million.

The humidifier is being incorporated into Konvekta's exhaust air cooling systems to help Konvekta deliver up to 92% annual energy recovery to its clients' buildings.

A Konvekta exhaust air cooling system pre-cools incoming fresh air to reduce a building's need for mechanical cooling. The Condair ME humidifier is used in this system to provide very low energy evaporative cooling to the warm air extracted from the rooms. Before the cooled extract air is vented externally, it is run through a heat recovery system and provides up to 10K of cooling to the incoming fresh air supply. A cooling effect from 32°C outside air temperature down to 22-23°C supply air temperature can be reached, without any mechanical cooling.

Amir Ibrahimagic, group business development manager at Konvekta, commented: ""Konvekta has standardised its exhaust air cooling systems on the Condair ME humidifier as its evaporative cooling solution. The reliability of the unit is second-to-none. It incorporates the highest quality components that give utmost longevity and performance to our clients. Alongside the product's USPs, Condair is also a very solutions-oriented partner. As a Konvekta energy recovery system is always custom designed for a client's needs, it's vital for us to have flexible design support from our evaporative cooling supplier.""

Ibrahimagic continued: ""As an example, a recent installation at a clinic in Tyrol, Austria, resulted in a confirmed annual energy recovery across the Konvekta systems of 92% for the building. A single Condair ME humidifier contributed more than 60,000kWh/a of cooling during this period from just 3,800kWh/a of consumed electricity. This low energy cooling significantly improved the building's overall energy efficiency and helped our client become the most sustainable clinic of its type in all of Austria.""

Konvekta is a leading global supplier of high efficiency run around energy recovery systems, with clients including MIT and Harvard University in the USA, as well as Frankfurt Airport, Germany, and Swarovski Optik in Austria. Its systems offer an average annual ROI of between three and seven years, depending on energy prices and operating hours. Alongside the highest efficiency systems on the market, the company offers a performance guarantee to clients, covering highly detailed financial and operational outcomes.

The company's Konvekta-Controller operates within a Digital Twin framework and provides net annual energy-saving calculations to design engineers early in the design phase. Following installation, the Konvekta-Controller presents current and historical performance data, allowing optimisations to be carried out to meet or exceed initial design projections.

The Condair ME in-duct adiabatic humidifier can be used to provide humidification or cooling to an air handling unit. Its evaporative matrix is located inside the duct and has water flowing down its surface. Air passing through the matrix is humidified and cooled without any aerosols being produced inside the AHU. The Condair ME has an innovative hydraulic pump module that can be located either inside the duct or externally, which allows servicing to happen without any AHU downtime. Units are available in sizes ranging from just 60x62cm to over 4x4m, with total outputs from a single unit of up to 1,200kg/h. In terms of cooling, this can equate to 822kW of adiabatic cooling from as little as 1kW of consumed electricity.

Energy sector environment

The first half of the 2023/24 financial year was again influenced by very

mild temperatures: For example, March 2024 was by far the warmest March in

Austria since the start of recording. The heating degree total - which

defines the temperature-related demand for energy - in all three EVN core

markets was clearly below the long-term average and, in each case, also

below the comparable prior year period.

Water flows were very positive during the reporting period. The respective

generation coefficients in Austria, North Macedonia and Germany were all

clearly above the long-term average. Wind flows in Austria also exceeded

the long-term average and were substantially higher year-on-year. In

Bulgaria, wind flows were lower than the previous year. The prices for

primary energy carriers and CO[2] emission certificates as well as the

market prices for base load and peak load electricity continued to decline

as a result of the weaker economy. The feed-in of renewable energies has

become a major influencing factor for the development of electricity

prices and the prices for CO₂ emission certificates.

Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT and Group net result below previous year

Revenue recorded by the EVN Group declined by 17.7% to EUR 1,805.1m in the

first half of 2023/24. This negative development resulted primarily from

the downward trend in wholesale prices for electricity and natural gas in

all three core markets as well as the resulting effects from the valuation

of hedges. Other contributing factors included the reduced use of the

Theiss power plant for network stabilisation, volume and price effects

from natural gas network sales volumes as well as the lower network

tariffs in Bulgaria which offset the overcompensation for the added costs

of network loss coverage in the previous year in accordance with the

regulation methodology. The international project business also reported a

decrease in revenue due to the largely completed wastewater treatment

plant in Kuwait. The decline in revenue was offset in part by an increase

in renewable production and higher network tariffs for electricity in

Lower Austria.

In line with the development of sales volumes and revenue, the cost of

energy purchases from third parties and primary energy expenses fell by

24.1% year-on-year to EUR 777.3m. This reduction resulted chiefly from the

decline in wholesale prices in South East Europe and lower primary energy

costs for electricity and heat generation. The cost of materials and

services fell by 20.8% to EUR 258.9m consistent with the development of

revenue in the international project business.

Personnel expenses, in contrast, rose by 16.8% year-on-year to EUR 225.7m.

The primary reasons were adjustments required by collective bargaining

agreements and an increase in the workforce to 7,496 (previous year: 7,185

employees).

Other operating expenses were 12.6% higher at EUR 113.5m. An impairment

loss of EUR 22.5m was recognised to a receivable from the wastewater

treatment plant project in Budva, Montenegro in the first quarter of

2023/24. It was based on a judgement issued by the Geneva Court of

Arbitration in January 2024 which confirmed payments totalling EUR 41.9m

received by WTE in previous years but did not recognise any further

claims. In contrast, the energy crisis levy on the surplus proceeds from

electricity generation was lower than the previous year due to the decline

in market prices and the adjustment of the deductible amount for the 2024

calendar year.

The share of results from equity accounted investees with operational

nature is still influenced by developments at the energy supply company

EVN KG, which reported a negative contribution of EUR -128.5m in the first

half of 2023/24 (previous year: EUR -223.1m). The negative valuation of

hedges as of the closing date was lower in period comparison, and

provisions recognised for contractual supply obligations were utilised.

However, intensified competition and the resulting downward trend in

natural gas tariffs led to an impairment of natural gas reserves purchased

in the past to protect supply security. The challenging framework

conditions - above all, intensified competition, energy savings by

customers and increasing feed-in from customers' own photovoltaic systems

- had an additional negative influence on electricity and natural gas

network sales and made the planning of sales volumes more difficult. In

addition, higher year-on-year contributions were received from the equity

accounted investees Burgenland Energie and Verbund Innkraftwerke. RAG, in

contrast, recorded a decline but in comparison with an above-average prior

year. In total, the share of results from equity accounted investees with

operational nature amounted to EUR -42.9m (previous year: EUR -143.3m).

Based on these developments, EBITDA recorded by the EVN Group declined by

2.9% year-on-year to EUR 453.0m in the first half of 2023/24. The higher

pace of investments led to an increase of 5.3% in scheduled depreciation

and amortisation to EUR 171.3m. In total, EBIT was 7.3% below the previous

year at EUR 281.6m.

Financial results totalled EUR -25.1m (previous year: EUR -27.5m). This

improvement reflected the better performance of the R138 fund and partly

offset the increase in interest expense. In addition, foreign exchange

developments had a stronger influence on financial results in the previous

year. The result before income tax was 7.2% lower at EUR 256.5m. After the

deduction of EUR 33.5m in income tax expense (previous year: EUR 35.2m)

and the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, Group net

result for the period equalled EUR 199.3m. That represents a year-on-year

decline of 8.3%.

Solid balance sheet structure

EVN has a solid and stable capital structure which provides a sound

foundation for the realisation of the extensive investment programme of

EUR 700 to 900m annually. These investments will continue to focus on the

network infrastructure, renewable generation and drinking water supplies;

three-fourths of them in Lower Austria. Net debt totalled EUR 1,357.6m as

of 31 March 2024 (30 September 2024: EUR 1,364.3m). In April and May 2024

both external ratings of EVN were confirmed by the rating agencies Moody's

(A1, outlook stable) and Scope Ratings (A+, outlook stable).

The syndicated credit line of EUR 400m of EVN was refinanced prematurely

at the end of April and replaced by a new syndicated sustainability-linked

credit facility of EUR 500m.

Energy. Water. Life. - Developments in the energy and environmental

services business

Energy business

EVN's electricity generation rose by 13.8 % year-on-year to 1,791 GWh in

the first six months of 2023/24. Above-average wind and water flows

combined with capacity expansion supported a 31,0 % increase in renewable

generation to 1.485 GWh. Reduced use of the Theiss power plant for network

stabilisation by the Austrian transmission network operator led to a

decline in thermal generation by 30.4 % to 306 GWh. The share of renewable

generation, in total, improved to 82.9 % (previous year: 72.0 %).

In addition to the commissioning of two wind parks in November 2023, the

commissioning of a large-scale photovoltaic plant in Dürnrohr (23.5 MWp)

took also place in the reporting period. Two further wind parks are under

construction: Sigless-Pöttelsdorf (8.4 MW; repowering) and Paasdorf (22.2

MW). Furthermore, preparations for construction of additional wind power

and photovoltaic projects were started.

Environmental and water business

The focal point of investments in drinking water supplies remains on the

planning and construction of transport and connecting pipelines to further

improve and protect supply security. Construction on the second section as

well as preparations for the third section are proceeding as planned for

the 60 km transport pipeline from Krems to Zwettl which will provide

long-term protection for water supplies in the Waldviertel and Weinviertel

regions. In the reporting period the natural filter plant in Obersulz was

completed and construction of a further plant in Reisenberg in the

Industrieviertel is in preparation.

In the international project business, WTE Wassertechnik was working on

the planning and construction of nine projects for wastewater treatment,

drinking water treatment and thermal sewage sludge utilisation in Germany,

Poland, Romania, North Macedonia, Bahrain and Kuwait as of 31 March 2024.

In the reporting period the wastewater plant in Kuwait was completed and a

successful test run took place; about two-thirds of the wastewater

treatment infrastructure was finalised.

Confirmation of the outlook and dividend policy for the 2023/24 financial

year

EVN expects Group net result within a range of EUR 420 to 460m for the

current 2023/24 financial year under the assumption of a stable regulatory

and energy policy environment. This outlook includes the Verbund dividend

of EUR 182m received by EVN in May 2024, i.e. during the third quarter of

the 2023/24 financial year. The dividend should equal at least EUR 0.82

per share in the future, whereby EVN wants its shareholders to

appropriately participate in any additional earnings growth. A payout

ratio equalling 40% of Group net result, adjusted for extraordinary

effects, is targeted for the mid-term.

This outlook includes the Verbund dividend of EUR 182m received by EVN in May 2024, i.e. during the third quarter of the 2023/24 financial year. The dividend should equal at least EUR 0.82 per share in the future, whereby EVN wants its shareholders to appropriately participate in any additional earnings growth. A payout ratio equalling 40% of Group net result, adjusted for extraordinary effects, is targeted for the mid-term.

The first half of the 2023/24 financial year was again influenced by very mild temperatures: For example, March 2024 was by far the warmest March in Austria since the start of recording. The heating degree total - which defines the temperature-related demand for energy - in all three EVN core markets was clearly below the long-term average and, in each case, also below the comparable prior year period.

Water flows were very positive during the reporting period. The respective generation coefficients in Austria, North Macedonia and Germany were all clearly above the long-term average. Wind flows in Austria also exceeded the long-term average and were substantially higher year-on-year. In Bulgaria, wind flows were lower than the previous year. The prices for primary energy carriers and CO emission certificates as well as the market prices for base load and peak load electricity continued to decline as a result of the weaker economy. The feed-in of renewable energies has become a major influencing factor for the development of electricity prices and the prices for CO₂ emission certificates.

Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT and Group net result below previous year

Revenue recorded by the EVN Group declined by 17.7% to EUR 1,805.1m in the first half of 2023/24. This negative development resulted primarily from the downward trend in wholesale prices for electricity and natural gas in all three core markets as well as the resulting effects from the valuation of hedges. Other contributing factors included the reduced use of the Theiss power plant for network stabilisation, volume and price effects from natural gas network sales volumes as well as the lower network tariffs in Bulgaria which offset the overcompensation for the added costs of network loss coverage in the previous year in accordance with the regulation methodology. The international project business also reported a decrease in revenue due to the largely completed wastewater treatment plant in Kuwait. The decline in revenue was offset in part by an increase in renewable production and higher network tariffs for electricity in Lower Austria.

In line with the development of sales volumes and revenue, the cost of energy purchases from third parties and primary energy expenses fell by 24.1% year-on-year to EUR 777.3m. This reduction resulted chiefly from the decline in wholesale prices in South East Europe and lower primary energy costs for electricity and heat generation. The cost of materials and services fell by 20.8% to EUR 258.9m consistent with the development of revenue in the international project business.

Personnel expenses, in contrast, rose by 16.8% year-on-year to EUR 225.7m. The primary reasons were adjustments required by collective bargaining agreements and an increase in the workforce to 7,496 (previous year: 7,185 employees).

Other operating expenses were 12.6% higher at EUR 113.5m. An impairment loss of EUR 22.5m was recognised to a receivable from the wastewater treatment plant project in Budva, Montenegro in the first quarter of 2023/24. It was based on a judgement issued by the Geneva Court of Arbitration in January 2024 which confirmed payments totalling EUR 41.9m received by WTE in previous years but did not recognise any further claims. In contrast, the energy crisis levy on the surplus proceeds from electricity generation was lower than the previous year due to the decline in market prices and the adjustment of the deductible amount for the 2024 calendar year.

The share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature is still influenced by developments at the energy supply company EVN KG, which reported a negative contribution of EUR -128.5m in the first half of 2023/24 (previous year: EUR -223.1m). The negative valuation of hedges as of the closing date was lower in period comparison, and provisions recognised for contractual supply obligations were utilised. However, intensified competition and the resulting downward trend in natural gas tariffs led to an impairment of natural gas reserves purchased in the past to protect supply security. The challenging framework conditions - above all, intensified competition, energy savings by customers and increasing feed-in from customers' own photovoltaic systems - had an additional negative influence on electricity and natural gas network sales and made the planning of sales volumes more difficult. In addition, higher year-on-year contributions were received from the equity accounted investees Burgenland Energie and Verbund Innkraftwerke. RAG, in contrast, recorded a decline but in comparison with an above-average prior year. In total, the share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature amounted to EUR -42.9m (previous year: EUR -143.3m).

Based on these developments, EBITDA recorded by the EVN Group declined by 2.9% year-on-year to EUR 453.0m in the first half of 2023/24. The higher pace of investments led to an increase of 5.3% in scheduled depreciation and amortisation to EUR 171.3m. In total, EBIT was 7.3% below the previous year at EUR 281.6m.

Financial results totalled EUR -25.1m (previous year: EUR -27.5m). This improvement reflected the better performance of the R138 fund and partly offset the increase in interest expense. In addition, foreign exchange developments had a stronger influence on financial results in the previous year. The result before income tax was 7.2% lower at EUR 256.5m. After the deduction of EUR 33.5m in income tax expense (previous year: EUR 35.2m) and the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, Group net result for the period equalled EUR 199.3m. That represents a year-on-year decline of 8.3%.

EVN has a solid and stable capital structure which provides a sound foundation for the realisation of the extensive investment programme of EUR 700 to 900m annually. These investments will continue to focus on the network infrastructure, renewable generation and drinking water supplies; three-fourths of them in Lower Austria. Net debt totalled EUR 1,357.6m as of 31 March 2024 (30 September 2024: EUR 1,364.3m). In April and May 2024 both external ratings of EVN were confirmed by the rating agencies Moody's (A1, outlook stable) and Scope Ratings (A+, outlook stable).

The syndicated credit line of EUR 400m of EVN was refinanced prematurely at the end of April and replaced by a new syndicated sustainability-linked credit facility of EUR 500m.

Energy. Water. Life. - Developments in the energy and environmental services business

Energy business

EVN's electricity generation rose by 13.8 % year-on-year to 1,791 GWh in the first six months of 2023/24. Above-average wind and water flows combined with capacity expansion supported a 31,0 % increase in renewable generation to 1.485 GWh. Reduced use of the Theiss power plant for network stabilisation by the Austrian transmission network operator led to a decline in thermal generation by 30.4 % to 306 GWh. The share of renewable generation, in total, improved to 82.9 % (previous year: 72.0 %).

In addition to the commissioning of two wind parks in November 2023, the commissioning of a large-scale photovoltaic plant in Dürnrohr (23.5 MWp) took also place in the reporting period. Two further wind parks are under construction: Sigless-Pöttelsdorf (8.4 MW; repowering) and Paasdorf (22.2 MW). Furthermore, preparations for construction of additional wind power and photovoltaic projects were started.

Environmental and water business

The focal point of investments in drinking water supplies remains on the planning and construction of transport and connecting pipelines to further improve and protect supply security. Construction on the second section as well as preparations for the third section are proceeding as planned for the 60 km transport pipeline from Krems to Zwettl which will provide long-term protection for water supplies in the Waldviertel and Weinviertel regions. In the reporting period the natural filter plant in Obersulz was completed and construction of a further plant in Reisenberg in the Industrieviertel is in preparation.

In the international project business, WTE Wassertechnik was working on the planning and construction of nine projects for wastewater treatment, drinking water treatment and thermal sewage sludge utilisation in Germany, Poland, Romania, North Macedonia, Bahrain and Kuwait as of 31 March 2024. In the reporting period the wastewater plant in Kuwait was completed and a successful test run took place; about two-thirds of the wastewater treatment infrastructure was finalised.

In a statement, the bank said it is currently implementing a mechanism to calculate its operational emissions across all its branches and offices to determine innovative opportunities for operational emissions reduction.

""First Bank is intentional about redefining its climate footprint. We are identifying opportunities in climate finance to improve our portfolio and reduce the carbon emissions associated with our processes and operations,"" Patrick Akhidenor, Ag. chief risk officer of FirstBank said in the statement.

""The bank is executing a financed emissions calculation mechanism as well as creating climate finance opportunities, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency products for our customers,"" he added.

According to the multinational bank and financial services company, it is calculating operational emissions across its branches and offices which includes calculating data on electricity use, diesel use, water consumption, waste management approach, fuel consumption, and business travels, to determine the bank's emission baseline and innovative opportunities for operational emissions reduction.

The bank, in a two-day partnership strategy workshop session with IPC and Valoris, consultants from Austria were engaged by Proparco in the climate mainstreaming project.

FirstBank's climate journey across all areas of implementation was reviewed to determine progress and empower strategic departments across the bank's operations, including the credit risk teams; human capital management & development; FirstAcademy, the bank's learning institute; corporate banking; personal banking; SME banking; procurement; branch operations and general services teams to deepen the understanding of climate risks in their processes.

The six workstreams for the implementation include identification of financed and avoided emissions to support reporting; supporting the measurement and analysis of operating emissions; integration of physical climate risk assessment; opportunity analysis; climate strategy and policy development; and capacity building amongst staff to support strategy implementation.

Elad Simchayoff, Channel 12 European correspondent, filmed while he covered a massive pro-Palestinian anti-Israel demonstration, exhibited great courage in a frightening situation.

In his speech, he noted that ""history doesn't repeat itself, but there are people who choose to repeat history."" October 7 is an example and a date on which Israel and all Jews were forced to choose as they encountered verbal and physical violence ""such as we have never known before,"" he continued.

Relating to what he had witnessed abroad, Simchayoff said that Jews in the Diaspora have to choose every day to stay where they are and face hatred.

Without being judgmental, Simchayoff nevertheless implied that they would be better off in Israel. Yet for all that, he obviously understood that most of them will choose to remain in the countries in which they live. ""Because of them, we're not alone,"" he said, ""and because of us, they're not alone.""

Even though they choose to live elsewhere, Simchayoff paid tribute to Diaspora Jews as being ""tremendous patriots for Israel.""

Canaan Lidor, the Jewish World reporter for The Times of Israel, spent several years in Amsterdam, which he and his wife found to be a wonderful place, but after a decade they missed Israel, and they realized that Jewish communities in the Diaspora are living in a perilous moment, unwanted by the surrounding society.

So they came home to Israel, where the cost of living is expensive, and the quality of life is on a different level. But this does not bother them.

""We need money,"" Lidor said, speaking from a national perspective, ""but most of all we need humans, and to work creatively across the aisle."" Acknowledging that he's a Zionist, Lidor called on Diaspora Jews to come to Israel.

Veteran singer Ilanit, who sang two popular songs from her vast repertoire, was the recipient of the Naomi Shemer memorial citation for fostering Israel-Diaspora Relations through the Arts.

Her parents arrived in pre-state Israel in 1939, having left Poland just in time. The family later moved to Brazil, but after a few years returned to Israel.

Ilanit, who in 1973 was Israel's first-ever Eurovision Song Contest contestant, and later traveled widely to give performances, said that she had many opportunities to build her career in Europe, but as far as she was concerned, the only place in which she wanted to live permanently was Israel.

Among the speakers were Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli, who gave a Zionist lesson on ancient history which to some extent is paralleled by current events; and former government spokesman Eylon Levy, who urged all present to speak up for Israel and to speak out against antisemitism.

Graduation ceremonies tinged with sadness

■ COMMENCEMENT AND graduation ceremonies at institutes of higher learning are supposed to be happy affairs, but in too many cases in Israel, they are tinged with sorrow by the fact that some of the new students lost a sibling or a parent in the October 7 massacre; or a student due to graduate fell in the war against Hamas.

Cases of the latter last week cast a pall on the annual honors ceremonies at Reichman University, where the families of the late Maj. (res.) Dor Zimel and Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Joseph Gitarts were awarded the Dean's Certificate of Excellence for the academic achievements of the two fallen soldiers.

Zimel, who was 27 years old when he fell, served as a deputy company commander in the 8103rd Battalion of the IDF's Etzioni Brigade, and was a third-year law and government student at RU's Harry Radzyner Law School.

On April 17, a month before his planned wedding to his fiancée, Shir - to whom he had proposed during the war - Zimel was critically wounded in a Hezbollah drone attack on the community of Arab el-Aramshe on the Lebanese border. He succumbed to his wounds a few days later, and his family, in a noble gesture, donated his organs to save the lives of seven people whom they did not know.

Gitarts, who was 25 years old at the time of his death, immigrated to Israel from Russia at the age of 13. He was a soldier in the IDF's 179th Reserve Armored Brigade's 7029th Battalion, and a second-year computer science student at RU's Raphael Recanati International School.

On December 25 Gitarts was killed by an anti-tank missile during a battle in the southern Gaza Strip. Before entering Gaza, he had written a letter to his parents that was published after his death and moved many people with its poignant words: ""I would do the same thing if I could choose again. I came to this decision by myself and stuck with it until the end. I fell proudly for the sake of my people. I have no regrets.""

In his remarks RU President Prof. Boaz Ganor said: ""Reichman University is proud of its sons and daughters, who in one moment put everything aside and set out to fight for the defense of our homeland. Tragically, nine of our students did not return from the battlefield, and we continue to await the return of Idan Shtivi, who is being held hostage in Gaza.

""Dor and Joseph epitomize excellence and the values of Zionism, leadership, freedom, and responsibility, which are at the core of our university's ethos. There is no greater pain than knowing that they are not here to enjoy the fruits of their labor. We share in the sorrow of their families, and are grateful to them for honoring us with their presence.""

National Library of Israel holds small events

■ THE NATIONAL Library of Israel (NLI), whose official opening was postponed time and again because construction had not been completed, was finally ready for its gala series of events, with invitations sent out for the week of October 22, 2023.

But then came October 7, and the gala opening, with all that it entailed, was not just postponed but canceled.

Nonetheless, smaller events have been held to honor the many donors for whom (or in memory of their family members) various areas of the library have been named.

In mid-May, Australian-Israeli millionaire Sir Frank Lowy and sons David and Steven were joined by President Isaac Herzog and his wife, Michal, NLI chairman of the board of directors Sallai Meridor and CEO Oren Weiberg, Alrov Group founder Alfred Akirov and his wife, Chava; Ray Shipping owners Rami and Yael Unger; former prime minister Ehud Olmert and his wife, Aliza; Sir Ronald Cohen; former president and CEO of Bank Leumi Rakefet Russak-Aminoach and Reem Aminoach; economist Prof. Manuel Trajtenberg; Executive Director of the Institute for National Security Studies and former head of Military Intelligence Tamir Hayman; KPMG Somekh Chaikin chairman Gad Somekh and his wife, Nitzan; and multidisciplinary artist Sigalit Landau in dedicating the library's centerpiece - the Hugo and Ilona Lowy main reading halls.

A second space, the Hugo and Ilona Lowy Special Collections Reading Room, enables the presentation and study of archival and rare materials. This magnificent room, with its old-world feel, was designed to display the renowned Valmadonna Trust Library, a collection of 13,000 rare printed Hebrew books and manuscripts, considered the finest of its kind in the world.

The dedication ceremony also included the unveiling of a statue, Hugo, sculpted by Landau, which was commissioned by Frank Lowy, in memory of his father. Hugo Lowy was clubbed to death on the Auschwitz railway platform by an SS soldier for refusing to leave his prayer shawl and phylacteries behind. The NLI in Jerusalem is probably the most suitable place in which to honor his memory in perpetuity.

The National Library's educational programs

■ THE NATIONAL Library also conducts a variety of educational programs in conjunction with the Education Ministry and with the support of generous individuals and philanthropic foundations.

The 2024 National Library of Israel Prize for Pedagogic Excellence in memory of Canadian-Israeli architect David Azrieli was awarded earlier last month at a festive ceremony, in the presence of ministry officials, library senior executives, and distinguished representatives of the Azrieli Foundation.

Now in its third year, this prestigious award is given to teachers who have initiated significant processes to strengthen humanities education in their schools; teachers who have cultivated in their students a desire to expand knowledge and academic horizons, while emphasizing research, reading and writing skills.

Dozens of teachers across the country were nominated by students, teachers, parents and principals, and the winners were selected by a committee comprised of public and education network officials, as well as representatives from the library and the foundation.

The three prizewinners will share a NIS 115,000 monetary award made possible as part of a five-year NIS 3.75 million gift from the Azrieli Foundation for the Israel National Center for Humanities Education, Israel's training center for humanities educators, which the NLI runs in collaboration with the ministry.

This year's prizewinners are:

Efrat Amit Leibovitz - pedagogical coordinator and teacher of literature and student affairs at Tichon Hadash Tel Aviv Yitzhak Rabin, who developed a three-year program for teaching the humanities to middle school; a program about civics and Judaism; and a course for educators on the teaching of the Oral Torah.

Shay Gillis - Jewish thought studies coordinator and Oral Torah teacher at the Shalom Hartman Institute's Charles E. Smith High School for Boys in Jerusalem, for creating lesson plans, for remote and on-site teaching, self-learning tasks, and a wide selection of cultural and art sources. These lesson plans led to a profound change in the school's teaching methods.

Anat Sade-Amit - literature studies coordinator at ORT Melton, Bat Yam, a school on the social periphery with a diverse student population.

Sade-Amit believes that enjoyment and love of literature is essential, and has developed unique teaching methods and tools to enable each student to improve their skills of expression, leading to the publication of a book of poetry by her students.

Sade-Amit also initiated a learning community for students to teach other students, and formed a group of 11th graders who go once a week to study philosophy and literature at Tel Aviv University.

Honorable mentions were awarded to: Anat Mor-Eilat of Beit Yerach High School and Ruth Ash-Argyle of the Leo Baeck Education Center.

Neta Shapira, director of the NLI Education Department, notes that at complex periods of national crisis and war, the role of teachers becomes ever more important. ""Even in difficult times we know that, to endure and survive each crisis, we must continue to learn and teach.

""We are proud to honor these teachers who have accompanied thousands of teenagers through the difficult years of pandemic, crises, and war, and help them give meaning to their lives and our lives as well.""

Danna Azrieli, chairwoman of the Azrieli Foundation Israel and chairwoman of the Azrieli Group, stated that ""teachers are at the forefront of sparking curiosity in the younger generation to ask questions, be inquisitive, experience reading, and explore different worlds, both near and far. These experiences will help them grow into better people as part of a healthier and more inclusive society.""

MKs active in support of hostages families

■ TWO FORMER Labor Party MKs, Emilie Moatti and Stav Shaffir, have been extremely active in their support of the families of the hostages still in captivity in Gaza. Moatti even suggested to German Ambassador Steffen Seibert that he host a morning meeting between representatives of the hostage families and ambassadors and other senior diplomats of countries whose nationals were or are among the hostages.

Seibert, who has been a constant presence with the hostage families, readily agreed.

The meeting, which took place at the German Embassy last Friday, included ambassadors and other high-ranking diplomats from Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Portugal, Serbia, Romania, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

People from the embassies represented have been in frequent contact with the families of the hostages. At the meeting they all reiterated their call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, including the bodies of the dead, some of whom were murdered in the October 7 massacre and taken to Gaza.

Seibert tweeted afterward: ""These days have been particularly devastating for the hostages' families. I thank their representatives for their time to meet today over a dozen ambassadors and diplomats in our embassy and share their stories and demands. Our common goal, ever more important: Bring them Home.""

US Ambassador Jack Lew tweeted that he had attended a meeting with hostage families, fellow ambassadors, and representatives of 14 countries whose citizens were taken captive on October 7.

""Standing together reinforces our common efforts to free the hostages and underscores our solidarity as we work to bring them home,"" he wrote.

Moatti, in a message of appreciation that she tweeted, noted that Seibert had been involved not only with families who hold German citizenship but also with those who don't.

Ireland's recognition of a Palestinian state is no surprise

■ ISRAEL, PARTICULARLY the Foreign Ministry, should not have been the least bit surprised at Ireland's recognition of a Palestinian state. It was bound to happen eventually, given Ireland's own history of bloodshed and reconciliation - but particularly at the present time. Though Ireland has repeatedly condemned Hamas, it has long advocated for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

At the present time, Ireland's representative to the Palestinian Authority is Feilim McLaughlin, who happens to be married to Ireland's Ambassador to Israel Sonya McGuinness. There must be some very interesting conversations in their household.

■ JOSH ARONSON, Maariv's UK-based correspondent, is a die-hard fan of Manchester United Football Club, as was the late Yonatan Rapoport, a dual national citizen of the UK and Israel who was murdered at his home in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7 while protecting his two children, Yosef, nine, and Aluma, six, who survived the Hamas attack.

In a personal tribute to Rapoport, Aronson wore a T-shirt bearing Rapoport's image to the FA Cup. Aronson said that he was pleasantly surprised by the fans who saw him and sent a warm message to the families of the hostages and the State of Israel.

Great-grandson of Menachem Begin serves in Gaza

■ GRANDSON OF former minister Bennie Begin and great-grandson of the late prime minister Menachem Begin, Ariel Regev, is a paratrooper who participated in heavy fighting in Jabalya in Gaza, and he's not the only combat soldier who comes from a well-known family which could have sent him to some faraway island barely touched by civilization, but which instead supported him or her when they answered the call to duty.

Violence on Mount Meron

■ POLICE BRUTALITY is deplorable under any circumstances, but so is civilian violence and irresponsibility, especially when it comes from the ranks of the purportedly pious.

There was no excuse for police using a truncheon on a senior citizen, nor was there an excuse for the vulgar epithets hurled at police by those same pious souls who refused to accept the safety regulations that allowed limited access to Mount Meron in order to avoid repetition of the catastrophe of three years ago in which adults and children were trampled on and 45 people, including children, were killed in the crush.

Had the two chief rabbis, Rabbi David Lau and Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, together with leaders of religious political parties, held a joint press conference urging people to consciously choose life rather than endanger it, the shameful, unholy Lag Ba'omer scenes might have been avoided.

The ferocity with which some of the ultra-Orthodox attacked police was indicative that, with a little discipline, they would be of far greater use to the army than to the yeshiva or the kollel.

Grief does not distinguish between faiths and nations

■ GRIEF AND pain do not distinguish between faiths and nations. The loss of a loved one is painful at any time, but more so in circumstances of violence known to survivors in both Israel and Gaza.

Someone has to convince Benjamin Netanyahu that the longer the war goes on, the less likelihood there is of any of the hostages surviving.

Antisemitism at University of Melbourne

■ AS SOMEONE born and raised in Melbourne, I found it somewhat painful to read the riveting article about antisemitism at the University of Melbourne that was written by Tammy Reznik and published in The Jerusalem Post earlier this month.

Some of the most distinguished Australians, including many Jews, are or were alumni of the university, including an impressive number now living in Israel, such as Mark Regev, a former media adviser to Netanyahu and later an Israel ambassador to the UK.

Among those who graduated long before the establishment of the State of Israel are two former governors-general, Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir Zelman Cowen, who were each legal experts.

Isaacs, was also the first Australian-born governor-general and had previously held the post of chief justice.

Cowen, an internationally recognized expert on constitutional law, was a faculty member and a guest lecturer at many universities in Australia, England, and the United States. He also served as dean of the Law Faculty at the University of Melbourne.

Another highly distinguished Jewish alumnus was Gen. Sir John Monash. A brilliant student, he graduated from the university with bachelor's degrees in arts and law and a doctorate in engineering.

He worked as a civil engineer, and during the First World War was a brigade commander. After the war, he was put in charge of the repatriation of Australian troops from Europe.

After returning home himself, he was appointed or elected to several important posts, such as head of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria; president of the Rotary Club; and president of the Zionist Federation of Australia.

Kfar Monash, in the northern part of the Sharon, is named in his memory, as are streets, towns, and neighborhoods in Australia. But perhaps most important in today's toxic climate is Monash University, which was founded in 1958 in his native Melbourne, and which has a large Jewish student population as well as a multidisciplinary Center for Jewish Civilization.

If the university student situation in Melbourne continues to be a hotbed of fear and violence, what will happen to a university named for a Zionist Jew, with a large number of Jews among students and faculty staff, Jewish education programs, and philanthropic support from Jewish foundations and affluent Jewish individuals? Will the university change its name to Mabruk, Maheer, or Mahfuz?

More recently, the Melbourne Jewish community has been shocked by antisemitic vandalism, including death threats that were daubed on the wall of the largest campus of Mount Scopus College, the pioneer Jewish school, which this year is celebrating its 75th anniversary.

Many of its alumni, including some living in Israel, went straight through from kindergarten to high school graduation.

Decreases in demand follow the EU Council Regulation's coordinated reduction measures passed in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

As of 2022, natural gas and electricity made up two-third of the EU's energy portfolio, with renewable energy representing a growing tenth.

The EU imports 90% of its natural gas, but decreased the fuel's imports by 18.4 million terajoules last year, about 20% of 2022 rates.

A measurement of energy consumption, one terajoule equals one trillion joules.

The EU's highest producers of natural gas, the Netherlands and Romania, each produced more than 350,000 terajoules in 2023, just about enough energy to satisfy demands from Hungary or Austria. Germany produced 143,532 terajoules of natural gas last year, about 3% of its nearly 3 million terajoule demand.

The five nations that use the most natural gas all reduced consumption last year, with Germany reducing the fuel's use by 2.96 million terajoules, nearly 4% of overall demand compared with 2022. At the same tine, Italy cut its own natural gas budget by 10%, and France by nearly 12%, each adding up to more than a million terajoule reduction.

Only six member states reported increased natural gas use last year, with Finland's use jumping more than 25% and Sweden's by 11%.

In all, demand for natural gas dropped nearly 20% over the last two years, 13% in 2022 and a further 7% in 2023. The EU required 12.72 million terajoules fewer last year, compared to the year prior.

Last year's levels of natural gas demand are the lowest in a decade, and comparable to rates of usage in the mid-1990s.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.2549019607843137,454635124,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/OTg1M2QxMzEtZDZ.jpg,

By Sofia Sanchez Manzanaro

In April 2024, the trial of nine people accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the German government began in Stuttgart. The case suggests what can happen when, in extreme circumstances, people feel politically alienated.

The suspects were, in the words of German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, 'driven by hatred towards our democracy.'

Local voices

Participation by residents in local decision-making across Europe can bolster public trust in their systems of democratic rule and limit the risk that dissatisfaction with governance veers towards violence, according to James Scott, a professor of regional and border studies at the Karelian Institute of the University of Eastern Finland.

'The important thing in the process is that people are involved - that they have a sense that we are co-making a decision,' said Scott, who is also an expert on populist movements. 'Not only are we deciding on it, but we also see that these decisions lead to concrete results.'

He leads a research project that received EU funding to examine and help spur more inclusive forms of local governance in Europe. Called EUARENAS, the project began in January 2021 and is due to run through October 2024.

The project is entering its final five months as Europe gears up for EU legislative elections that take place twice a decade. On 6-9 June, voters in the 27 EU Member States will choose 720 members of the European Parliament.

Along with the Council of Ministers representing national governments, the Parliament decides on European laws covering everything from food safety and airline passenger rights to car emissions and electricity supplies.

The assembly also acts as the EU's budget authority and plays a key role in the formation of each European Commission leadership team following the legislative ballot.

Elections to the EU Parliament are in part a barometer of voter sentiment towards national governments and can trigger political changes within Member States.

In the last EU legislative ballot in 2019, voter turnout rose for the first time since the initial European Parliament elections in 1979. Europe's two main political families - the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists - saw their seat totals drop by more than 30 each.

Mind the gap

Many people in Europe view their governance system as too distant to be influenced, leading to a polarisation of public debate and a rise in anti-democratic political forces, according to Scott.

To counter this trend, EUARENAS has studied examples of social movements and local government actions to expand political participation. It also encouraged grassroots initiatives such as neighbourhood assemblies, participatory budget communities and ""citizen panels"".

The project has brought together academics, local authorities, policy experts and social activists in seven European countries: Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK.

'Many organisations are out there trying to promote a closer sense of citizen engagement, belonging and ownership of governance processes,' said Scott.

The EUARENAS team has analysed and enacted pilot programmes in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the UK.

Opening up

One initiative by the project is a housing and urban development plan involving residents of the Polish coastal city of Gdansk.

'We didn't want to create the master plan from the top down but instead to involve the communities affected by it in the decision-making process,' said Scott.

In the Italian city of Reggio Emilia, residents represented in neighbourhood panels designed an agenda to address the main challenges people face. High among their concerns was the climate crisis.

In the Estonian town of Võru, which is grappling with an exodus of young people, EUARENAS identified ways to enhance their quality of life and employment prospects.

Residents of Võru addressed education on mental health and the well-being of youngsters, with one initiative placing stickers with QR codes in two schools. The codes linked to mental health websites.

A prominent role played by young people in the area was reflected in first-hand testimonies collected by EUARENAS.

Lasse Rihard Sissas, a ninth grader from Võru, cited his strong connection to the region and its natural beauty. He recommended more learning opportunities for people his age and called for the creation of a local university.

'It would be nice if there was a university here,' Sissas said in a project video. 'Young people would stay.'

Regardless of the particular local challenges, more inclusive decision-making at that level can limit the risks of social divisions and political exploitation of them by reactionary political forces, according to Scott.

'Decision-making has to be more democratic, more open,' said Scott.

Bridge-building

In the German trial in Stuttgart, prosecutors have charged the nine suspects with plotting a coup aimed at installing an aristocrat in power. German police reportedly foiled the alleged plot during raids in 2022.

The court proceedings are among three German trials this year involving a total of 26 defendants, all of whom are accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the federal government.

One challenge in nurturing grassroots involvement in public debates is that people who harbour extreme views are more reluctant to voice them, according to Pierangelo Isernia, a professor of political science at the University of Siena in Italy.

'They think they will be exposed and attacked because of their ideas,' he said.

Isernia led another EU-funded project into how liberal democracies can tackle political polarisation through more inclusive decision-making. Called EUCOMMEET, the project wrapped up in February 2024 after three years.

Language lessons

It featured an experiment involving a total of more than 400 people in five EU countries: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Poland.

The participants exchanged views on the climate crisis - a topic that Isernia said has had an increasingly polarising effect in Europe and beyond.

Initially, the exchanges took place locally by involving people from the same city. Then the conversations became national and, finally, European with a concluding plenary session in which people from at least three countries exchanged views.

The sessions each involved eight to 10 people. In a reflection of the experiment's cross-border nature, an open-source online platform allowed the participants to communicate in their native languages.

'People could discuss in their language and understand what others were saying,' said Isernia. 'We showed that this is possible.'

A main finding of EUCOMMEET is that exchanges of these kinds among people help reduce divisions over any given topic.

Isernia said he hopes that platforms like the one developed by the project will be integrated into future EU efforts to involve the general public in policy considerations.

For instance, he recommends that the next European Commission organise 'short-term consultations' to capture evolving public opinions.

'Surveys are not enough to understand what people really think,' said Isernia. 'You need to see how a person evolves in their thinking through a conversation and deliberative processes are the best way of understanding this.'",moderndiplomacy.eu,news,Modern Diplomacy,,-0.2862745098039216,454629905,1,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/european-union.jpg,

Earlier this month, the sun unleashed the most powerful streams of plasma, known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), in 20 years, causing communication disruptions worldwide.

The sunspot that caused the chaos has swung back around and released a powerful flare toward Earth's region on Monday.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a 60 percent chance of radio blackouts on Tuesday and throughout the rest of the week.

The sun (pictured) emitted 17 small solar flares on Monday and one major X2.9 flare which is the largest class ranking

NOAA issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch on May 11 when the same sunspot was smashing our planet with dozens of energized streams of plasma.

A solar or geomagnetic storm is a major disturbance of Earth's magnetosphere - the area around Earth controlled by the planet's magnetic field.

NOAA's alert was the first given since 2005 when Earth was hit with the highest dose of radiation in a half-century.

The unusual event earlier this month disrupted GPS, power grids, farming equipment and satellites in orbit - and experts are monitoring Monday's flare in preparation of the same issues.

The sunspot, labeled AR3664, has released 17 flares this week, but the strongest has captured attention worldwide.

'I have not seen an explosion like this in my 40 years of observing the sun,' Amateur astronomer Michael Karrer, from Austria told SpaceWeather.

'So fast, so far out into space! It was gigantic,' he said.

Sunspot AR3664 is currently not facing directly at Earth, but data shows it will move in view by the end of the week and could unleash solar storms toward out planet.

While the storms are not expected to reach levels seen earlier this month, they are expected to cause a level three (R3) radio blackout that may last from just minutes to hours and affect GPS systems and radio communication.

GPS systems are disrupted because the radiation emitted from the solar flare hits the magnetic sphere surrounding Earth, causing fluctuations in the ionosphere.

The ionosphere is a layer in the upper atmosphere that absorbs and reflects signals during geomagnetic storms, causing static and disruptions in the signals received by GPS systems.

Auroras are also expected to spread across northeast Canada tonight, although no official forecasts related to the solar storm have been released.

The US could be impacted by the loss of cell phone communication, GPS signals and hour-long blackouts as a result of the solar flares. Pictured: Filtered image of the sun's solar flare from Milano, Italy

The flare first came from the old sunspot region AR3664, the same location as the May 10th storm, marking the first of its kind in 21 years. Pictured: Active region of the sun emitting solar flares

The sunspot first ejected solar flares on May 10 before it rotated away, but its reemergence could mean a powerful geo-storm is heading toward earth.

Earlier this month, a powerful G5 solar storm hit earth, marking the largest outburst in 20 years that was expected to collapse US power grids and cause nationwide blackouts.

There weren't significant impacts caused by the storm, although some farmers reported they lost access to their GPS systems, forcing them to pause operations.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that there weren't more severe problems because they were prepared.

""Simply put, the power grid operators have been busy since yesterday working to keep proper, regulated current flowing without disruption,"" Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator for the NOAA told NPR at the time.

Other astronomers captured images of the sun emitting the solar flare across the world over the last two days ranging from Arizona, Virginia and countries as far away as Italy and Chile.

Scientists have warned that these extreme eruptions could only be the start of more powerful solar flares that could hit Earth next year, causing the worst geo-storm in 165 years.

In 2019, the sun had zero reported visible sunspots on its surface, but the US National Space Weather Prediction Center estimated there could be up to 115 by July 2025.

Astronomers worry that another extreme solar flare could mirror the 1859 Carrington Event that set telegraph wires on fire, disrupted ships' compasses and cut off communications worldwide.

If an event of that magnitude occurred today, it would have much more widespread implications because of the modern-day reliance on technology for every day operations.

This would mean home medical equipment that requires electricity to function would be rendered useless and without cell phones, there would be no way to call 911 in the case of an emergency.

Major geomagnetic storms can also destroy satellites by causing them to crash into other objects in space.

The 2022 geomagnetic storm was the last severe storm prior to early May, which destroyed up to 40 Starlink satellites worth more than $50 million.",expressdigest.com,news,expressdigest.com,,0.1686274509803922,454625570,1,,

In the fourth week of May, prices in most major European electricity markets increased between Monday, May 20, and Friday, May 24. Although prices fell over the weekend, the weekly averages of all analyzed markets rose compared to the previous week. The Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries reached the highest percentage price increase, 87%. In contrast, the IPEX market of Italy and the N2EX market of the United Kingdom registered the smallest percentage increases, 0.1% and 9.7%, respectively. In the rest of the markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices rose between 30% in the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium and 71% in the MIBEL market of Portugal.

In the fourth week of May, weekly averages exceeded €45/MWh in most analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the Nordic and French markets, with averages of €24.59/MWh and €36.50/MWh, respectively. The Italian market registered the highest weekly average, €96.18/MWh. In the rest of analyzed markets, prices ranged from €46.40/MWh in the Spanish market to €89.78/MWh in the British market.

Regarding hourly prices, most analyzed European markets registered negative prices on Sunday, May 26. The exceptions were the British and Italian markets, with no negative prices in the fourth week of May. The German, Belgian and Dutch markets also reached negative prices on May 20 and the last two markets, on May 22. In the case of the Nordic market, there were negative prices on May 25 and 26.

On Sunday, May 26, from 14:00 to 15:00, the German, Belgian, French and Dutch markets reached prices below ?€23/MWh. The Dutch market registered the lowest hourly price of the fourth week of May, ?€23.89/MWh.

On the other hand, on Monday, May 27, from 20:00 to 21:00, the German market reached a price of €221.46/MWh, the highest price since early December 2023 in this market.

During the week of May 20, the rise in the average price of gas and CO emission allowances had an upward influence on European electricity market prices. In addition, in markets such as Germany, Spain or Portugal, wind energy production decreased in the fourth week of May. In the case of the British, Italian and Dutch markets, electricity demand increased, contributing to weekly prices being higher than in the previous week.

AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's price forecasts indicate that in some European electricity markets, such as the French, Spanish or Portuguese markets, prices might fall in the last week of May, influenced by the increase in wind energy production in these markets. On the other hand, in other markets such as Germany or Italy, where wind energy production might decrease, prices might continue to increase.

Brent oil futures for the Front?Month in the ICE market registered their weekly maximum settlement price, $83.71/bbl, on Monday, May 20. However, prices declined during the first four sessions of the fourth week of May. As a result, on Thursday, May 23, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, $81.36/bbl. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 2.3% lower than the previous Thursday and the lowest since the first half of February. On Friday, May 24, there was a slight recovery and the settlement price was $82.12/bbl.

In the fourth week of May, expectations that interest rates will remain high in the United States for longer due to inflation exerted a downward influence on Brent oil futures prices. In addition, US oil reserves increased.

As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front?Month, in the fourth week of May they continued with the price increases initiated in the last sessions of the previous week. On Monday, May 20, they registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €31.77/MWh, which was already 7.4% higher than the previous Monday. Price rises continued until Thursday, May 23. On that day, these futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €35.83/MWh. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was 18% higher than the previous Thursday and the highest since the first half of December 2023. On Friday, May 24, after a 4.8% decrease, the settlement price was €34.11/MWh. This was still 11% higher than the previous Friday.

In the fourth week of May, forecasts of higher demand for air conditioning, combined with lower supply, drove prices higher. Forecasts of high temperatures for the coming summer and high demand for liquefied natural gas from the Asian market might continue to exert their upward influence on TTF gas futures prices. However, European reserve levels remain high. On the other hand, news that Russian gas supplies to Austria might end this summer due to legal problems in making payments also contributed to the price increase in the fourth week of May.

As for CO emission allowance futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2024, they reached their weekly minimum settlement price, €74.22/t, on Monday, May 20. However, this price was already 5.0% higher than the last session of the previous week and 6.3% higher than the previous Monday.

Decreases in demand follow the EU Council Regulation's coordinated reduction measures passed in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

As of 2022, natural gas and electricity made up two-third of the EU's energy portfolio, with renewable energy representing a growing tenth.

The EU imports 90% of its natural gas, but decreased the fuel's imports by 18.4 million terajoules last year, about 20% of 2022 rates.

A measurement of energy consumption, one terajoule equals one trillion joules.

The EU's highest producers of natural gas, the Netherlands and Romania, each produced more than 350,000 terajoules in 2023, just about enough energy to satisfy demands from Hungary or Austria. Germany produced 143,532 terajoules of natural gas last year, about 3% of its nearly 3 million terajoule demand.

The five nations that use the most natural gas all reduced consumption last year, with Germany reducing the fuel's use by 2.96 million terajoules, nearly 4% of overall demand compared with 2022. At the same tine, Italy cut its own natural gas budget by 10%, and France by nearly 12%, each adding up to more than a million terajoule reduction.

Only six member states reported increased natural gas use last year, with Finland's use jumping more than 25% and Sweden's by 11%.

In all, demand for natural gas dropped nearly 20% over the last two years, 13% in 2022 and a further 7% in 2023. The EU required 12.72 million terajoules fewer last year, compared to the year prior.

TE H2, an 80/20 joint-venture formed by TotalEnergies and EREN Groupe, and VERBUND have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Tunisia to study the implementation of a large green hydrogen project, H2 Notos, in the North African country for export to Central Europe through pipelines.

H2 Notos is expected to produce green hydrogen using electrolyzers powered by large onshore wind and solar projects and supplied with desalinated sea water. The project aims to produce 200,000 tons of green hydrogen annually during its initial phase, with the potential to scale up production to one million tons per year in South Tunisia.

The project will have access to the European market through the SoutH2 Corridor, a hydrogen pipeline project connecting North Africa to Italy, Austria, and Germany, which is expected to be commissioned around 2030. The project is expected to utilize more than 70% repurposed infrastructure, with new pipeline segments where necessary.

""By combining competitive hydrogen production in Tunisia and pipeline-based transportation, we can ensure a long-term supply at scale to support a sustainable transition of our customers to green hydrogen as well as support a sustainable economic development in Tunisia,"" said Michael Strugl, chief executive of VERBUND.

While heavy industry and governments pin their hopes on hydrogen for faster decarbonization, and power-generating companies and oil and gas majors look to diversify into low-carbon hydrogen production, costs are still high for green hydrogen production and hold back massive deployment of projects, analysts say.

This two-part project aims to test the feasibility of integrating small-scale wind energy into urban environments. Over the next year, Luvside will collect data to assess the potential for scaling this technology and incorporating it into larger sustainability strategies.

The second part of the project is based at the Atlantis Special Greentech Economic Zone where Luvside will deploy a larger installation of its horizontal turbines.

The V&A Waterfront sees this initiative as an opportunity to raise awareness about renewable energy and demonstrate cutting-edge practices in sustainability. The wind turbines, highly visible in this often-windy location, serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting the environment for future generations.

Luvside, founded by Ralph Hoffmann, has been developing small-scale wind turbines for over a decade. Hoffmann, a passionate windsurfer with a deep connection to Cape Town, was inspired to create a sustainable solution with real-world impact.

""There was an oil company asking for this because they didn't have any power plugs, and needed independent electricity, so we took the challenge to produce something that can exist in the 200km/h North Sea winds,"" Hoffmann explains.

""All the stuff that they bought from China flew away, so we began to develop and brought a team of people from all over the world just to come in this melting point close to Munich.""

Unfortunately for the Luvside team, however, Munich is relatively windless, and they had to drive out to the mountains of Austria to test the prototypes.

The V&A Waterfront pilot project has also received support from the German Energy Agency (DENA) through its Renewable Energy Solutions Programme. This programme, funded by the German government, promotes the export of climate-friendly technologies and facilitates knowledge transfer between Germany and target markets.

Hoffmann envisions a future where small-scale wind turbines become as commonplace as solar panels, contributing significantly to the global energy transition. The company is confident that continued advancements in technology and mass production will make wind energy more accessible and affordable for everyone.

When Bizcommunity asked Rodney Love, CEO of Luvside's local partner ESA, about possible local manufacturing he limited that possibility to ""turbine blades"" claiming that the German engineering in the generators too complex to implement.

Luvside mechanical engineer Ashwin Vijay, however, explained that the specification could be made available to a local commercial partner and the company is looking towards that as a future development.",bizcommunity.com,news,Bizcommunity.com,,0.2549019607843137,454589687,1,https://biz-file.com/c/2405/738911-1200x624.jpg?5,eng-9604104

BY THE NUMBERS

The multi-billion-dollar project, H2 Notos, aims to produce 200,000 metric tons of hydrogen a year using desalinated water from the Mediterranean and electricity from wind and solar farms in southern Tunisia. A ramp-up to 1 million tons per year is possible.

The hydrogen would be transported to Europe through a 3,300 km (2,050 mile) pipeline connecting Tunisia to Italy and continuing onto Austria and Germany, which is being planned by companies including Snam.

Production could begin as early as 2030, with Verbund taking some of the hydrogen and transporting it throughout Central Europe.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

The European Union aims to produce 10 million tons and import 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 in a bid to replace hydrocarbons, which emit planet-warming gases when burned.

European industrials are already signing hydrogen supply deals and investing to upgrade equipment to run on the green fuel, which emits water when combusted.

KEY QUOTES

""What is notable about this project is its ability to transport low-cost hydrogen directly to Europe via pipeline,"" TEH2 CEO David Corchia said in a media call.

""Pipeline transport adds about 1 euro ($1.09) per kilo to the cost, compared with 3.5 to 4 euros per kilo when you transform hydrogen to ammonia, ship it on a boat, and re-crack it back into hydrogen.""

""The Americans are moving but haven't cracked that problem better than we have. They are still transforming it and putting on boats, it's just that they are heavily subsidized,"" Corchia added.

WHAT'S NEXT

A final investment decision is expected in 2027 or 2028.

The AICHELIN Group, a company of Berndorf AG, is a global market leader in the heat treatment of metals and achieved record revenue of EUR 214 million in the 2023 financial year. Despite global crises and difficult conditions in Europe, the company was able to record very good overall performance and is planning further expansion steps for 2024.

The globally positioned AICHELIN Group based in Mödling increased its turnover to EUR 214 million in 2023, an increase of 16 % after EUR 184 million in 2022. The Group grew both in its core segments of plant engineering - it produces industrial furnaces, industrial heating systems, control and automation systems as well as Industry 4.0 solutions - and in the service division, which now accounts for almost 40 % of the total sales.

The positive development reflects the geographic diversification of the Group. AICHELIN has subsidiaries in eight countries on three continents and a distribution network in 22 countries. The Group generates 45 % of its sales in the EU, 35 % in Asia and 20 % in North America.

""Our global footprint contributes significantly to our success. Our strong positioning was a key factor in our double-digit percentage growth in both revenue and earnings last year. We rely on decentralized local production facilities with a strong regional presence to respond efficiently to customer needs. This also makes us more resilient to unstable supply chains,"" says AICHELIN Group CEO Christian Grosspointner.

Focus in Europe: New Assembly Center as an opportunity in a difficult market environment

To increase its competitiveness, the AICHELIN Group is joining forces in Europe and has established a new, joint production site in Europe. The modern 4,125 m2 Assembly Center Europe was built in Celje, Slovenia, next to the existing site and has been operating since the first quarter of 2024. All European production activities are now carried out here.

""The market situation in Europe is difficult, especially in the area of new equipment. Customers are postponing investments, partly because of the difficult conditions for the industry, such as high inflation, increased energy costs and the lack of qualified personnel,"" explains Grosspointner. ""However, we have a clear commitment to the location and want to remain a strong industrial partner in Europe. With our new Assembly Center Europe, we are pooling our strengths to respond even more efficiently to our customers' needs.""

In addition, the Group is focusing on its core competencies with the sale of its subsidiary EMA Indutec GmbH, which specializes in induction heat treatment (see press release in March 2024). The proceeds will be invested in future-oriented projects such as modern furnace solutions for the heat treatment of battery powder, for example for e-mobility, the expansion of the product portfolio and in M&A projects.

Strategic investments in the global network and in new business areas

With the consistent implementation of its long-term location and growth strategy, the AICHELIN Group is expanding its branches and business areas. Investments in production capacities will strengthen the existing presence on the European, Chinese and American markets. In order to benefit even more from the positive economic environment in North America, the comprehensive modernization of the US site in Wixom (Michigan) began last year; the Group is also planning to expand its presence in this region.

In China, AICHELIN is investing in the future-oriented markets of wind energy and e-mobility, which is having a positive impact on business development. By positioning itself in these industrial sectors, the Group has been able to establish long-term partnerships to strengthen its innovative power and further expand its own market position. Business development in India is also recording robust growth, largely driven by investments in the country. In 2024, AICHELIN will expand its market presence with a new production site and increase its capacity in the Indian market.

In the area of burner systems & components, the Group entered a new segment in the aluminum sector with the acquisition of Wiedemann Industriebrenner at the beginning of 2023 and increased sales in this business area by about one third. Most recently, the Group announced its entry into the vacuum furnace segment: The joint venture agreement signed in May 2024 (see press release) with Sistem Teknik provides for the production and distribution for industrial vacuum heat treatment technologies and their services in Europe. This completes the Group's product portfolio.

Growing demand for sustainable heat treatment solutions

Driven by global requirements, the demand for energy-saving solutions and the use of alternative heating technologies such as electricity or hydrogen is also increasing significantly in the heat treatment sector. In addition to basic services such as maintenance, spare parts and safety upgrades, AICHELIN's Service business segment offers comprehensive consulting and implementation expertise for modernization to increase plant performance and reduce CO2 emissions,. The resulting savings translate into tangible cost reductions for the customer. The AICHELIN Group is also reaffirming its own commitment to sustainability; most recently by advancing the Group's ISO 14001:2015 certification for the implementation of a sustainable environmental management system.

""With our strong, international team of more than 1,000 employees and our investments, we are creating the basis for developing sustainable, environmentally friendly and resource-saving solutions for tomorrow's heat treatment together with our global customers,"" CEO Grosspointner concludes on the AICHELIN Group's future path.

This is aimed at achieving a holistic integration of climate action on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction through an articulated strategic pathway to position the Bank as an African Climate Bank.

Ag. Chief Risk Officer, FirstBank, Patrick Akhidenor while reinforcing the Bank's commitment to mainstreaming climate initiatives said, ""FirstBank is intentional about redefining its climate footprint.

""We are identifying opportunities in climate finance to improve our portfolio and reduce the carbon emissions associated with our processes and operations.

""The Bank is executing a financed emissions calculation mechanism as well as creating climate finance opportunities, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency products for our customers,"" he said.

The 130-year-old financial institution is currently implementing a mechanism to calculate its operational emissions across all its branches and offices.

This includes calculating data on electricity use, diesel use, water consumption, waste management approach, fuel consumption, business travel, etcetera to determine the Bank's emission baseline and innovative opportunities for operational emissions reduction.

First Bank is developing the required capabilities and competencies by investing in its employees and the right infrastructure for integrating climate action into the Bank.

In a two-day partnership strategy workshop session with IPC and Valoris, consultants from Austria engaged by Proparco in the climate mainstreaming project, First Bank's climate journey across all areas of implementation was reviewed to determine progress and empower strategic departments across the Bank's operations

This includes the Credit Risk teams; Human Capital Management & Development (HCMD); FirstAcademy, the Bank's learning institute; Corporate Banking; Personal Banking; SME Banking; Procurement; Branch Operations and General Services teams to deepen the understanding of climate risks in their processes.

The six workstreams for the implementation include the identification of financed and avoided emissions to support reporting; supporting the measurement and analysis of operating emissions; integration of physical climate risk assessment; opportunity analysis; climate strategy and policy development; and capacity building amongst staff to support strategy implementation.

Dr Martin Steindl, Managing Director, Valoris, Austria, said, ""Amongst our various engagements with financial institutions on climate mainstreaming, FirstBank is the only organization that has been able to provide data both on the assets' location of their portfolio and head offices of their clients. I am impressed with the progress we have collectively achieved.""

Nigeria has committed to reducing its GHG emissions to 20 per cent by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2060. While this is ambitious, it sets the tone for businesses in Nigeria to at least support their GHG emissions reduction strategy with national plans and targets.

FirstBank is committed to achieving this goal and this is evident as the bank is a signatory to the Africa Business Leaders' Climate Statement released in 2022 at COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt by the Africa Business Leaders Coalition (ABLC).(www.naija247news.com).",naija247news.com,news,Naija247news,Azonuchechi Chukwu,0.2078431372549019,454578465,3,https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/images-2024-05-28T084225.209.jpeg,

Speaking at the Public hearing on the bill organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, former Minority Leader of the Senate, Enyinnaya Abaribe and constitutional lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, warned that the issue of the National Anthem should not be treated with a legislative fiat .

Minister of Justice said as commendable as the move by both Chambers of the National Assembly may be, on enacting a law on the National Anthem or replacing the current one with the old, Nigerians must be carried along for their required ""buy in"".

He said: ""In some cases, national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration.

""The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions.

""Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone.

""Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria's National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc.

""The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.""

Abaribe, in his submission, said he was totally against the move, while explaining that the second stanza of the National Anthem is the country's national prayer.

He also revealed that his senatorial district was totally as against the move, as there are more pressing issues that require the attention of the Federal Government.

He said: ""While we support the efforts of the Federal Government under President Bola A. Tinubu to ameliorate the difficulties that Nigerians face today of biting inflation, crippling unemployment and widespread insecurity, we do not feel that it is a priority to embark on a homegrown National Anthem 46 years after its adoption by Nigerians.

""The reasons given for such unseemly haste to revert back to the colonial era anthem ark rather nebulous and mostly self-serving.

""Reverting to an anthem that harks back to our troubled past as a nation does not enhance unity. Rather it reminds us all of nomenclatures such as 'Tribes, Tongues', Natives' which divides us as a nation and which led to the unfortunate civil war.

""The present anthem has a second stanza that is used as our National Prayer. Thus, going back to the old anthem will make the nation be put even further apart as it will mean we will not have a National Prayer.

The move by the National Assembly to replace the current national anthem with the former one through an expeditious legislative process suffered a setback on Monday.

Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, who attended a public hearing on the matter organized by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, warned that the issue of the National Anthem, should not be treated with legislative fiat.

He said as commendable as the move by both Chambers of the National Assembly may be, enacting a law on National Anthem or replacing the current with the old demands that, Nigerians are carried along.

Fagbemi said: ""In some cases, national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration.

He argued that ""The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions.""

""Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone.

According to him, ""the decision to change Nigeria's National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc.

""The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.""

Former minority leader of the Senate, Eyinnaya Abaribe, said he was totally against the move because the second stanza of the National Anthem is the country's national prayer.

He also revealed that his senatorial district was totally against the move, as there are more pressing issues that require the attention of the Federal Government.

He said: ""While we support the efforts of the Federal Government under President Bola A. Tinubu to ameliorate the difficulties that Nigerians face today of biting inflation, crippling unemployment and widespread insecurity, we do not feel that it is a priority to embark on a homegrown National Anthem 46 years after its adoption by Nigerians.

""The reasons given for such unseemly haste to revert back to the colonial era anthem ark rather nebulous and mostly self-serving.

""Reverting to an anthem that harks back to our troubled past as a nation does not enhance unity. Rather it reminds us all of nomenclatures such as 'Tribes, Tongues', Natives' which divides us as a nation and which led to the unfortunate civil war.

""The present anthem has a second stanza that is used as our National Prayer. Thus, going back to the old anthem will make the nation be put even further apart as it will mean we will not have a National Prayer.

The lawmaker contended that

the present National Anthem was accompanied by a pledge which all children and patriots recite at official functions.

""Will reverting back to the old anthem not mean abrogation of the pledge since they go together? He queried.

""The peoples of Abia South Senatorial District are desirous of policies and plans to reduce the pump price of petrol from the present 1.000 naira per litre in Aba, the 224 naira per kWh of electricity, the more than 100% increase in food prices than going back to an anthem written by a colonial citizen of Britain and bequeathed to Nigerians at our independence in 1960.

Of that, the total value of exports is 5.47 billion BAM, which is 477 million BAM less or 8.03 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. Imports to Bosnia and Herzegovina amounted to 9.46 billion BAM and are higher by 491 million BAM or 5.48 percent compared to the previous year.

The annual trends in foreign trade exchange show signs of recovery, which is particularly expressed by the growth of exports in April, when there was an increase in exports compared to March this year, but also compared to April last year.

""We have a decrease in the export deficit by 93 million BAM compared to the quarterly report, and an increase in the coverage of imports by exports by one percent. We have to take negative trends in foreign trade exchange with an appropriate reserve, because the practice so far has shown a reduced volume of exports and economic activities at the beginning of the year. Additionally, the key economic projections for the year 2024 have a positive trend, so with a reduction in inflation and positive growth projections for the European economy, we can expect improvements in foreign trade during the year,"" says the analysis of VTK BiH.

From the countries of the European Union, our main trading partner, the largest drop in exports was recorded in the markets of Italy (12.4 percent), Austria (10 percent), Germany (7.5 percent), Slovenia (6.2 percent), Croatia (5 .68 percent). Among the CEFTA countries, the largest drop in exports was recorded on the Serbian market (20.8 percent). Encouraging increases in exports to the so-called other markets, where an increase in exports to the Turkish market was recorded (26.8 percent).

The movements of imports had the opposite tendency to exports, where an increase in imports was recorded from most EU countries. The most important import markets are Croatia, Serbia, Germany, Slovenia and Italy.

When it comes to products and tariffs, the biggest drop was achieved in the export of electricity. The export of electricity decreased by 281.58 million KM, which is mainly the result of lower electricity prices on the international market compared to the previous year. In the ore, metals and products sector, exports decreased by 167.1 million BAM or 14 percent, and the decrease refers mainly to the decrease in exports of iron and steel and their products. The drop in textile industry exports of 66 million BAM is also significant.

Of the products that have an increase in exports, we should mention the products of the dedicated industry, where an increase in exports of 66 million BAM was recorded in the reference period, and the highest percentage growth was achieved in the export of weapons and ammunition tariffs by 97 percent, the export of products of the agro-industrial sector in the amount of 31 million BAM or 9.35 percent, and there is an increase in the pharmaceutical sector of almost 70 percent or 17 million BAM.

""The reduced inflationary trends in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the surrounding area are encouraging, which significantly affects the stabilization of the prices of raw materials and raw materials. Projected inflation values this year are between 2.5 and three percent, which is close to the desired goals set by the leading economies of the EU and The projections of the growth of the gross domestic product and industrial production give hope that the negative trends in the foreign trade of BiH from the beginning of this year will be amortized and will have a positive effect on the level of economic activity in BiH"", according to the analysis of VTK BiH.",sarajevotimes.com,news,Sarajevo Times,,0.1137254901960785,454510891,5,https://sarajevotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/export.jpg,eng-9601297

If these plans materialise, they're likely to derail the energy transition in both countries, undermining EU efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

In Bulgaria, OMV Petrom, the Romanian subsidiary of Austrian fossil energy giant OMV, is seeking to resume exploration at the Han Asparuh offshore gas field. The project could pump 13 billion cubic metres (bcm) of fossil gas a year between 2030 and 2040, and 8 bcm a year by 2050. But the company would first need to register a discovery before its license, first granted in 2012, expires at the end of the year.

Since TotalEnergies withdrew from the project earlier this year, following Repsol's exit four years earlier, OMV Petrom is currently the project's only stakeholder. As Bankwatch previously revealed, the Bulgarian government has been actively seeking to acquire its own stake, but thus far without success.

Meanwhile, eager to push the gas project forward, Bulgarian authorities appear to be cutting corners. According to a recent report, plans are underway to 'unite exploration and production licenses under one agreement' in a bid to shorten the period between exploration and production. There are also plans to reduce the time it takes to carry out and appeal environmental impact assessments.

At the adjacent Neptun Deep field, also located in Romanian waters, OMV Petrom, together with Romanian state-owned company Romgaz, could begin drilling for gas even earlier. Set to officially start production in 2027, the project would see 100 bcm of fossil gas extracted over the next two decades. This would make Romania the EU's biggest fossil gas producer. At a time when the country - and the EU as a whole - need to slash fossil gas use, Romania's transmission system operator expects domestic gas consumption to grow significantly.

According to Romania's energy minister, an agreement reached by the Council of the European Union in March urging EU Member States to continue coordinated demand-reduction measures until April 2025 is 'more of a recommendation'. He confirmed Bucharest is intent on increasing fossil gas consumption, and to ensure demand grows, the Romanian authorities are now busy building new gas infrastructure, from power plants to distribution systems.

Although OMV Petrom is still awaiting a crucial environmental permit from the relevant authorities to go ahead with Neptun Deep, which could be issued any day, the future of both the Romanian and Bulgarian fossil gas projects remains uncertain. In Bulgaria, where fossil gas consumption is currently 3 bcm a year, any new fossil gas production would require a substantial increase in either domestic gas consumption or exports.

Yet, there is little appetite in Europe for long-term gas import deals beyond 2035. In fact, if the EU fully implements REPowerEU, its strategy aimed at weaning Europe off Russian gas imports, overall gas demand should halve by 2030. Therefore, given the estimated EUR 4 billion investment in each project, both of these ventures pose not only major climate risks but also economic risks due to the likely insufficient demand for all the gas produced.

In mid-May, the Bulgarian environment ministry held transboundary public consultations over the Neptun Deep project. Local community members, representatives of non-governmental organisations, and officials from both countries were invited to the coastal town of Kavarna to discuss the implications of the offshore gas project. Yet, the discussion was mostly dominated by OMV Petrom representatives, with little intervention from local authorities. Civil society members, including Bankwatch, raised concerns about the project's climate impact, the use of toxic chemicals, and the risk of accidents. But these concerns were largely brushed off by OMV Petrom representatives, who claim Neptun Deep will have no significant transboundary impacts. For their part, the Bulgarian authorities also expressed their agreement with the proposed measures.

Yet, both Han Asparuh and Neptun Deep pose direct threats to EU climate action. The environmental impact assessment for Neptun Deep makes the ludicrous claim that fossil gas drilling would generate 'negative emissions'. However, this claim is based on the assumption that the gas extracted would replace coal in energy production, and that Romania's operating coal capacity is three times higher than it actually is.

In reality, Neptun Deep's climate footprint over its projected 20-year lifespan, including its associated pipeline infrastructure, could reach a staggering 209 million to 227 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), primarily from gas combustion. This equates to around 10 million tCO2e per year, surpassing Romania's current annual coal industry emissions (8.6 metric tonnes in 2022, and decreasing). These findings, taken from a recent report commissioned by Greenpeace Romania, raise serious concerns about the validity of the predicted Neptun Deep figures.

For several years now, civil society have been sounding the alarm over the two projects, their climate price tag and the toll they would take on marine wildlife. In Romania, since the offshore law enabling the Neptun Deep investments was approved in 2022, environmental groups have sent open letters to the Romanian parliament, and warned on ￼￼ occasions of the project.

In late March, Greenpeace activists staged a direct action outside OMV Petrom's headquarters demanding the cancellation of Neptun Deep. A month earlier, Greenpeace filed a lawsuit against the companies behind Neptun Deep and the local environmental protection agency that had approved the project's onshore infrastructure for failing to assess the full scale of its environmental ramifications.

And it's not only activists and non-governmental organisations. Three years ago this month, the International Energy Agency warned that, if the world is to reach net zero emissions by mid-century, there can be no more new oil and fossil gas exploration and production. Failing to do so vastly increases the chances of a full-blown climate chaos. And in a recent report, the OECD concluded that Romania should not approve new oil and gas explorations, since falling gas demand in Europe after 2030 might pose a financial risk for new projects (see page 108). Yet, policymakers in Romania and Bulgaria, much like the profit-driven fossil fuel industry, are evidently looking the other way.

If realised, the Neptun Deep and Han Asparuh projects would cement both Romania's and Bulgaria's dependence on fossil fuels for far longer than the world can afford. While the Romanian government intends to use most of the Neptun Deep gas domestically, there are plans to export Black Sea fossil gas to neighbouring countries, most likely to Hungary and Austria. Under the pretext of energy security, gas exports could mean entrenching the dependence on dirty, expensive fossil gas throughout the region.

To make matters worse, Neptun Deep is being enabled by EU money. While the drilling itself might not be directly in receipt of EU funding, the supporting infrastructure - namely, the pipeline connecting the rig to the national grid, without which the project cannot function - has already received over EUR 230 million via the EU's Modernisation Fund and the European Investment Bank.

EU leaders have repeatedly been speaking of the need for the world to end fossil fuel subsidies. This was also one of the EU's priorities for the UN climate summit in Dubai in November 2023. A month earlier, however, the then Hungarian President Katalin Novak reiterated Budapest's intentions to buy fossil gas from Neptun Deep and called on the EU to finance it.

Sinking public money into any fossil fuel project is effectively stabbing the European Green Deal in the back. EU politicians and institutions should not endorse either Neptun Deep or Han Asparuh. Instead, they should call these projects out for what they really are: climate wrecking balls.

For now, the important decisions are set to be taken at the national level. Both the Romanian and Bulgarian governments need to acknowledge that pumping more fossil gas runs completely counter to the public interest and to immediately withdraw support for these planet-heating follies. In tandem, decision makers must prioritise sustainable energy for their citizens by investing in electricity grids, renewables, and energy efficiency.",bankwatch.org,news,Bankwatch,,-0.03529411764705881,454508057,1,https://bankwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WWW-Use-for-webpage-covers-blog-post-publications-PRs-1-24.png,eng-9614055

This is aimed at achieving a holistic integration of climate action on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction through an articulated strategic pathway to position the Bank as an African Climate Bank.

The 130-year-old financial institution is currently implementing a mechanism to calculate its operational emissions across all its branches and offices.

This includes calculating data on electricity use, diesel use, water consumption, waste management approach, fuel consumption, business travel, etcetera to determine the Bank's emission baseline and innovative opportunities for operational emissions reduction.

FirstBank is developing the required capabilities and competencies by investing in its employees and the right infrastructure for integrating climate action in the Bank.

In a two-day partnership strategy workshop sessions with IPC and Valoris, consultants from Austria engaged by Proparco in the climate mainstreaming project, FirstBank's climate journey across all areas of implementation was reviewed to determine progress and empower strategic departments across the Bank's operations, including the Credit Risk teams; Human Capital Management & Development (HCMD); FirstAcademy, the Bank's learning institute; Corporate Banking; Personal Banking; SME Banking; Procurement; Branch Operations and General Services teams to deepen the understanding of climate risks in their processes.

The six workstreams for the implementation include the identification of financed and avoided emissions to support reporting; supporting the measurement and analysis of operating emissions; integration of physical climate risk assessment; opportunity analysis; climate strategy and policy development; and capacity building amongst staff to support strategy implementation.

Dr Martin Steindl, Managing Director, Valoris, Austria, said, ""Amongst our various engagements with financial institutions on climate mainstreaming, FirstBank is the only organization that has been able to provide data both on the assets' location of their portfolio and head offices of their clients.

The manufacturer is launching the 22 kW wallbox in time for the launch of the E-Transit Custom. It will initially be introduced in the UK and later gradually in other European markets.

Ford states that the AC charger is aimed specifically at companies that have neither a central vehicle depot nor their own full-time fleet manager. The offer is called 'Ford Pro Home Charging' and includes a home charging solution for employees with extended functions, such as billing of charging processes, status monitoring or preconditioning. The 22 kW charging solution will initially be available in the UK in the summer of 2024 before being gradually rolled out in other European markets. Ford will not be more specific at this point.

As the US American company emphasises that the new device will accompany the launch of the E-Transit Custom, the introduction in the DACH region could follow in autumn or winter. This is because deliveries of the new e-transporter in the 1-tonne segment are expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2024 to customers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Incidentally, the E-Transit Custom is capable of AC charging with 11 kW, which should allow a full charge in 6.7 hours.

The new charger is designed for the use case where drivers charge their company car at home overnight outside of working hours. According to Ford, the charging management software included in the offer allows charging processes to be planned and programmed remotely at times with favourable electricity tariffs. The wall box charging station can also interact with the Ford Pro telematics system, which ""also simplifies the reimbursement of travel costs and compliance with accounting requirements"".

AMAG Austria Metall AG is taking further steps towards the decarbonisation of its site in Ranshofen and is thus reducing its dependence on natural gas through the increased use of green electricity. In partnership with Energie AG, the existing rooftop photovoltaic plant is being doubled in size. Once the work has been completed, this will be the largest rooftop photovoltaic plant in Austria. Construction work starts in June 2024 and commissioning will take place by the end of the year.

For the planned expansion, photovoltaic plant modules will be installed on six halls at the AMAG plant site, with 63,000 square metres of gross roof area, to supplement the existing system, which covers an area of area of 60,000 square metres. The total area of 120,000 square metres will be used to generate electricity and is similar in size to around 17 football pitches. This measure will enable annual energy production to be almost doubled from 7.3 GWh to 13.3 GWh. GWh, whereas the current annual demand is around 250 GWh. This additional amount of energy is comparable to the energy consumption of around 3,700 households per year.

The electricity generated is used exclusively for AMAG's own requirements and supplements the electricity mix, which has been 100 % renewable since 2017. With the expansion of the rooftop photovoltaic plant, AMAG is taking a further step on its path to CO neutrality, which is accompanied by ongoing technological improvements and innovations to increase energy efficiency.

""As part of our efforts to decarbonise and move away from fossil fuels, green electricity from various sources will play a key role. Therefore, the expansion of our existing rooftop photovoltaic plant is another important step that we are taking together with Energie AG,"" says Helmut Kaufmann, Chairman of the Management Board and Chief Technical Officer of AMAG Austria Metall AG.

""Solar energy is already playing a key role in sustainable and regional energy generation. With the doubling of the existing rooftop photovoltaic plant in Ranshofen, we are continuing our expansion offensive for solar power together with AMAG, thus making an active contribution to a fossil-free energy future,"" says Leonhard Schitter, CEO of Energie AG.

The head of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, Leo J. Lamberson, is in the center, with Senator Bob Wilson at the left. [MARIA HECKINGER ARCHIVE]

Dear Greece,

You are the land of my birth. Of my mother's birth, and of all the mothers that came before her.

She was unmarried when she became pregnant with me. She was from a small village in the Peloponnese and was therefore unable to keep me. She left, never to return.

I was born in December 1962 in Athens, and adopted from Mitera sometime in 1963/64. My adoptive mother was Greek but had lost her citizenship with her marriage to my adoptive father, a British citizen.

They adopted my brother Alex at the same time.

Both of us have applied to have our citizenship reinstated through our birth mothers who were Greek nationals when they gave birth to us.

My journey away from you was quick. My journey home has taken four years already and I've yet to clear the first hurdle. I submitted my application to the Greek Consulate in London in 2020. I am still waiting for an acknowledgment, for a case number.

Greece. These are my earliest memories of you.

Our house in London, full of exiles. Theodorakis, his musicians, Mercouri and countless others made stateless during the turbulent years of the junta.

I remember also all the long hot summers spent at our beach house near Halkida, where my mother, her sister and two brothers built small houses to accommodate our large extended family. All us children running between them, playing, watching wide-eyed when my uncle brought large blocks of ice wrapped in hessian sacks from the village, then chopped it into chunks and placed in the four iceboxes.

I remember too our small hands carefully carrying the empty ""stamnes"" to be filled from the well - pumped only after 5 p.m., when our sleepy community resurfaced after a seemingly never-ending ""mesimeri.""

We had no electricity back then.

At night we would sing and dance or play cards by the orange light of the oil lamps. Then to sleep in our own beds or top-to-toe if the houses were full of visiting relatives (more often than not); to be woken the following morning by a donkey braying in a far-off field, to sit drinking our milk in the cool shade of the trees, watching as Yiayia started cooking dinner, scooping out the flesh of vegetables into a large bowl, then grating onion, adding herbs, rice and mixing together with the oil harvested from the trees under which we sat.

It is there I learned what family means. What you, Greece means.

It was the summers spent diving for shells and competing to see who could go deepest, burned nut-brown by the sun that sustained, scorched and bonded us forever.

My adopted mother died when I was 14. My adopted father signed over the house to me and my brother and chose a different path, a new wife, a new life. But for us, there was only this life, this family, OUR family and it remains so to this day.

Growing up with two cultures has its challenges. Nowadays they call children like us ""third culture kids."" But then there was no word for it.

In England, we never completely fitted in. We were branded ""Greek"" at the pleasure of whoever, whenever they wanted.

""Don't let her write about Turkey."" I overheard the editor say to no one in particular in my first newsroom job at the beginning of my journalism career. ""She's Greek!""

Meant to defame I suppose, but in truth it made me love you more.

For it was as a journalist that I really got to know you outside of Athens and the community of my summer home.

Over my career I've sat with Greek officials in Phuket City Hall in Thailand, as they tirelessly waited for the handful of Greeks then unaccounted for in the days following the Boxing Day Tsunami.

I have spent weeks outside your parliament, talking to those who'd made their home in Syntagma Square, as successive governments held emergency talks late into the night on the economic crisis and what should be done.

More recently I watched as my fellow countrymen offered water, food, blankets, with an extended hand of friendship on the beach at Skala Sikamias in Lesvos, where 800,000 fleeing war arrived in rubber dinghies.

I have walked with refugees as they made their way through Idomeni, the Balkans, Hungary, Austria and Germany all the way up to northern Finland. I always asked about their journey to reach safety, how it had been, the welcome they received, or lack thereof.

""Yunan, Greece good,"" each would say with a smile and give me a thumbs-up. It filled me with pride.

Greece. Each year as spring turns towards summer my heart is pulled towards you, my homeland. Flights are booked. Friendships dusted off. ""When will you get there?"" we ask each other from across the globe, for we are part of the diaspora that each year comes home to recharge, to take stock and by doing so, live our best lives.

Dear Greece. I have always been told I'm Greek. So do you know what it's like not to be accepted by you?

It's like standing outside of a room, the door locked. I can hear voices inside. They're the voices of my country, talking in my mother tongue. I bang on the door to be let in. Inside they can hear me, but they don't open. I get angry, frustrated and bang louder.

Still nothing, just silence, as if I'm being punished for an unintended sin. So I stop banging and slump to the ground overwhelmed with grief, weeping, deflated, rejected yet again.

For yes, for those of us who are adopted, it's another rejection.

Rejected by our birth mothers, now rejected by the country which gave birth to us.

Dear Greece, agapimeni mou Ellada, I ask that you please, please recognize me as one of your own.

FirstBank is committed to achieving this goal and this is evident as the bank is a signatory to the Africa Business Leaders' Climate Statement released in 2022 at COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt by the Africa Business Leaders Coalition (ABLC).",dailytrust.com,news,Daily Trust,,0.1450980392156862,454336788,3,https://dailytrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/First-Bank-UK-573x400.jpeg,eng-9600972

THE Endeavour Housing Association was formally registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 on August 16, 1974.

There were, though, much bigger stories for The Northern Echo to report on 50 years ago.

The morning of the registration, the Echo told how Court Line, Britain's biggest holiday company, had gone bust, leaving 40,000 holidaymakers stranded abroad and 150,000 people not knowing whether their holiday would go ahead. They included Hazel Johnson, 21, of Stockton and her fiancé Kevin Feeney who were due to fly to Austria for their honeymoon.

""We'll try to go to the Lakes instead, if we can get in,"" said Hazel.

The Echo's front page also reported how an assassin had missed his target, the South Korean president Park Chung-Hee, but had shot and killed the president's wife, Yuk Young-soo, in Seoul.

Locally, the Stockton-based Fiesta nightclub chain revealed its plans to take over the ABC cinema - the famous Globe - in the town, while in Darlington, there was a strike at the Cummins engine plant over union recognition.

1974 is remembered as the year of a sugar shortage - there was a genuine shortage, but when it became known, panic-buying worsened the situation. However, on August 16, 1974, the Echo reported that the Amos Hinton chain of supermarkets was restocking its shelves with the sweet stuff, although customers were being asked to buy £1.50 worth of other goods before they were allowed to buy 2lbs of sugar.

Durham County Council was advertising for a clerk/typist to work at its headquarters on between £672 and £1,464 a year, depending on qualifications and experience. In Melsonby, a four bedroomed ""chalet-style detached house with a Tyrolean finish"" in St James Close was on the market for £20,000 - call East Layton 252 for further details said the advert.

August 16, 1974, was a Friday, so the Echo's sports pages were looking forward to the kick-off of the football season the following day, with Middlesbrough, under Jack Charlton, joining Newcastle in the First Division. However, the matches were overshadowed by football's discipline problems, as shown the week before when Liverpool's Kevin Keegan and Leeds United's Billy Bremner had been sent off for brawling at Wembley in the Charity Shield.

Dissent against referees' decisions was described as ""the curse of the modern game"", but the newly elected president of the referees' association, Pat Partridge of Cockfield, told the Echo: ""People say players become frustrated and express their anger with dissent to referees, yet one can draw a parallel to ordinary life. If a car driver is stopped by a policeman, he does not immediately kick up and rebel against authority.""",thenorthernecho.co.uk,news,The Northern Echo,,0.003921568627450966,454322020,1,https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/resources/images/17731203/,

The FTSE 100 looked to cap off the week with a worse performance.

By late trading, London's blue-chip index was down 16 points at 8,323, as gains by the likes of Ocado, M&S and B&Q owner Kingfisher failed to buoy the FTSE 100.

Energy companies and utilities were among companies to fall on Friday, with Nation Grid, Centrica, Severn Trent and United Utilities all down.

Friday's fall took the FTSE 100 down 95 points, or 1.1%, for the week.

US indices looked to fare better in the meantime, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones all up in morning trading across the Atlantic.

IG analysts noted US stocks had shrugged off ""risk-off sentiment amid this week's 'rates higher for longer' outlook"", after durable goods order data on Friday showed an unexpected rise for April.

3.41pm: US on ""unsustainable fiscal path"" - Fed governor

Federal Reserve governor Cristopher Waller has warned ""unsustainable"" borrowing by the Biden administration risks leading to higher interest rates.

""The US is on an unsustainable fiscal path,"" Waller told Iceland's Reykjavik Economic Conference on Friday.

""If the growth in the supply of US Treasuries begins to outstrip demand, this will mean lower prices and higher yields.

This would ""put upward pressure"" on the neutral rate, he warned.

President Biden had cancelled some US$7.7 billion (£6.05 billion) worth of student debt, held by 160,000 borrowers, earlier this week, taking the total amount of debt forgiveness under his administration to US$167 billion.

3.30pm: Ocado jumps as things look like only getting better for retail

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO) looked to solidify its spot as Friday's top FTSE 100 riser, climbing by 4.6% to 368.30p.

Though weak retail sales data for April looked to highlight the ongoing cost pressures consumers faced, analysts seemed optimistic things could improve for the sector soon.

""Weak retail figures shouldn't have surprised given the miserable weather we've had for much of 2024,"" AJ Bell's Russ Mould noted.

""The sooner interest rates are cut, the better, as far as investors are concerned.

""Not only should that make consumers feel a bit more confident about their finances, but it should also put businesses in a stronger position to increase investment.""

Analysts had highlighted subsiding inflation and growing wages as reasons for optimism earlier in the day.

B&Q owner Kingfisher PLC (LSE:KGF) and Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LSE:MKS) also held onto gains in late trading.

The FTSE 100 as a whole fell by 11 points to 8,327 during the day, though, weighed down by the likes of utilities.

""This comes as Severn Trent, the water utility company, reported stronger than expected earnings earlier this week,"" XTB's Kathleen Brooks explained.

""The stock rose to a 5-month high earlier this week, however, it has experienced a sharp selloff, as the market focuses once more on the challenges facing the water sector as it struggles to maintain clean rivers and waterways with the changing, wetter weather in the UK.""

3.00pm: AJ Bell slips as boss sells £28mln worth of shares

AJ Bell slipped 3% on Friday on news chief executive Andy Bell had sold £28.1 million worth of shares in the online investment company.

Bell sold 7.5 million shares at 375p each, marking a 7% discount to Thursday's closing price, a regulatory filing showed.

Bell has been left with an 18.7% stake in AJ Bell, which he founded, following the move.

This came after shares in the company jumped on Thursday following results showing a 47% jump in pre tax profit to £61.4 million, reflecting an improved margin of 46.8%.

Director Billy Mackay and chief technology officer Amber Tagari have also sold parts of their stakes in AJ Bell, another filing on Thursday showed.

Shares fell 3.9% to 387.28p.

2.43pm: Positive start on Wall Street

Wall Street enjoyed a positive start as trading got underway on Friday.

The Nasdaq was up 64 points after the opening bell, reversing falls seen on Thursday despite NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD)'s rally after beating first-quarter expectations.

The Dow Jones and S&P 500 also climbed, by 64 and 18 points respectively, after slipping alongside the Nasdaq earlier on in the week.

Thursday drop ""was triggered by expectations the Fed's first interest rate cut could [be] delayed by several further months, after a much stronger-than-expected US business activity ended a run of soft data releases,"" City Index's Fawad Razaqzada explained.

Attention turned to durable goods orders, due on Friday afternoon, while Federal Reserve governor Cristopher Waller is also set to speak later on.

""Markets [are] hoping for weakness given the 'good news is bad news' construct highlighted by yesterday's PMI release,"" Scope Markets analyst Joshua Mahony added.

""With the FOMC minutes highlighting a mixed range of views that included the potential to hike rates further, any pop in the core durable goods orders figure could further drive risk-off sentiment given the implications for monetary policy.""

1.55pm: Thames Water to wait longer for decision on bill hike plan

More on Thames Water and Ofwat has reportedly pushed back its review of the supplier's plan to hike bills.

According to the Telegraph, the date by which Ofwat will approve or block the plan has been changed from June 12 to July 11.

Such plan would see Thames Water hike bills by 45% over the coming years as it grapples with high debt and plans £19.8 billion of investment for 2025 to 2030.

Thames has appeared on the brink of collapse, with payments to bondholders being defaulted on, board members quitting and plans reportedly being drawn up to unload £500 million worth of loans onto the market most recently... Read more

1.43pm: Retailers climb despite poor April sales

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), Kingfisher PLC (LSE:KGF) and Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LSE:MKS) were among the FTSE 100's top risers into Friday afternoon.

Up 1.7%, 1.2% and 0.9%, gains came despite worse-than-expected retail sales data for April earlier in the day.

Analysts subsequently noted sales should tick up in the coming months as the likes of lower inflation and growing wages help to deepen consumer pockets.

Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES) topped the day's losers, down 2.5%, while Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY), St James's Place PLC and Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) also fell.

""European equity markets are on track for their worst weekly performance in three weeks, as risk sentiment sours and interest rate bets get pushed back once again,"" XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks said.

""Stronger than expected CPI in the UK, an increase in negotiated wage growth in the first quarter for the Eurozone, hawkish Fed minutes in the US and strong PMI data have all contributed to a 'risk off' tone to markets, even though Nvidia's monster results suggest that the AI boom still has much further to go.""

1.14pm: Wall Street to open higher

Futures contracts are pointing to a bullish start to Friday for the US markets, with the Nasdaq 100 tipped to open 54 points above yesterday's close.

The broader S&P 500 index is set to open 15 points higher at 5,283.

Following yesterday's blockbuster earnings report, chipmaker NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is expected to add another percentage point after rally to an all-time high yesterday.

Things are quieter on the company news front today, with attention turning to durable goods orders and consumer sentiment on the macroeconomic calendar.

12.57pm: Thames Water lender seeking to offload £500mln

A lender to crisis-struck utilities provider Thames Water is seeking to offload £500 million worth of loans onto the market, according to a Bloomberg report citing ""people with knowledge of the matter"".

The lender is also hoping to offload £100 million in bonds, according to the report.

Amid financial stress and a walloping £16 billion debt pile, Thames Water's bonds have plummeted to just 5.8p on the pound.

Though this presents a steal for potential buyers who may be more optimistic about Thames Water's prospects than market pricings suggest, the company's troubles are manifold.

Parent company Kemble's debt was heavily discounted after defaulting on £400 million of bonds in April, with recent turmoil among the board of directors adding to the woes.

Thames Water's largest shareholder Omers Infrastructure withdrew its board representative last week, with more board members subsequently quitting this week.

Omers fully wrote down its 31.7% stake in Kemble, calling the utility ""worthless"" and ""uninvestable"".

12.25pm: Bitcoin, Ethereum down despite landmark ETF approval

Bitcoin (BTC) fell for the fourth day in a row on Friday, wiping out the majority of the gains penned on Monday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency closed 1.7% on Thursday, with the BTC/USD pair dipping another 0.8% this morning.

Attention has firmly shifted to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, following spot-ether approvals in the US.

Speaking on the development, ETC Group suggested that the regulatory nod, which effectively brings ether to the mainstream stock market, will result in approximately $1.65 billion of ""potential"" net inflows in the first three months of trading.

""The approval marks a significant shift in sentiment within the SEC and among US regulators in general but US investors still received inferior investment vehicles compared to European vehicles,"" said ETC Group.

It may take a few months for the ETF products to officially launch, ETC Group suggested. Once they do, ETC Group suggested a potential 92% increase on the ETH/USD pair.

At the time of writing, ETH/USD was swapping for $3,706, over 22% higher week on week.

Interestingly, the pair dipped 2% following the SEC's approval, suggesting the event was already priced in.

12.03pm: Things can only get better (apart from standing charges)

D:Ream's early-90s hit found itself a new lease on life after drowning out Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's damp election announcement on Thursday, but things are getting better for personal finances too.

That's according to interactive investor's senior personal finance expert Myron Jobson, who said that Ofgem's decision to drop the energy price cap ""adds to a growing sense that things are getting better for personal finances"".

There are caveats though.

""The harsh reality is many aren't feeling it,"" stated Jobson. ""The substantial jump in the cost of renting and high mortgage rates have come at a high cost in pounds and pence terms. The savings from the fall in the energy price cap won't touch the sides of what's needed to offset the heightened housing cost burden for many households.

""Energy bills have thankfully come down after reaching record highs in 2022. However, households are still set to pay 44% more, or £484 on average, than they did three years ago in summer 2021, before the energy price shock caused mainly by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Jobson highlighted standing charges as a ""thorny issue"" affecting energy consumers. ""They are applied to gas and electricity bills regardless of whether customers have used any energy, which makes it harder for people to save money by using less energy.""

11.38am: Nvidia price cuts

Briefly looking stateside, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) has reduced prices on some of its high-end AI chips in China by up to 20%, according to an exclusive report by Reuters.

This move is seen as a strategic effort to remain competitive against Huawei, a major Chinese tech company.

The price cut specifically affects the A800 chip, which Nvidia developed as an alternative to the A100 chip.

Nvidia began shipping the A800 chip to mainland China after the Biden administration's export ban on the cutting-edge A100 chip.

US tech sanctions against China aim to curb the Communist Party's development of military-grade AI technology, but they are also causing challenges for Nvidia.

During the company's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, senior Nvidia executives cautioned about ""substantially"" lower sales in China due to the export restrictions.

""Our data center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October,"" said Colette Kress, chief financial officer. ""We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.""

Despite these challenges in China, Nvidia surpassed analysts' expectations with a significant earnings beat, boosting the chipmaking giant's valuation by hundreds of billions of dollars.

11.16am: St James's Place FTSE 100's biggest loser after Hargreaves bid-fuelled rally

St James's Place PLC emerged as the FTSE 100's biggest loser on Friday, falling 3.1% after having climbed on news of a bid for rival Hargreaves Lansdown.

Hargreaves itself was down 5% on Friday, after spiking on news of the rejected £4.7 billion bid by CVC Capital Partners, Nordic Capital and a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

The consortium subsequently said another ""possible offer"" was being considered, adding a ""further announcement will be made as and when appropriate"".

HL's second-largest individual shareholder Stephen Lansdown said the bid had ""woken the stock up"" in the meantime.

HL had jumped 14% on Thursday, while peer St James's Place gained 5%.

""It's interesting to see that third parties are now seeing the value in Hargreaves Lansdown and looking to take advantage of it,"" he added.

The FTSE 100 ticked down 28 points to 8,310, as Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES), Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY) and Experian (LSE:EXPN) PLC were among others to also fall.

11.01am: Oil slips as OPEC delays meeting

Oil prices dropped on Friday on news major oil-producing nations, or OPEC+, had pushed back their latest meeting to discuss supply cuts.

Benchmark Brent Crude fell 2% to US$80.74 a barrel, having peaked above US$90 in early April.

Having committed to cuts of around 2.2 million barrels daily collectively this year, OPEC+ delayed the date of its next meeting by a day to June 2.

This comes against the backdrop of increasing output from the United States, alongside fears over demand due to high interest rates globally.

10.33am: Consumer confidence grows in May

Consumer confidence indicators have improved this month, driven by a better outlook for personal finances, GfK has reported.

The Consumer Confidence Index climbed by two points in May to minus-17, the firm said on Friday.

This was as forecasts for personal finances over the coming year rose strongly by five points to positive seven.

""With the latest drop in headline inflation and the prospect of interest rate cuts in due course, the trend is certainly positive,"" GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said.

""All in all, consumers are clearly sensing that conditions are improving.""

He did highlight a reduction in GfK's major purchase measure, however, highlighting reduced confidence over buying big-ticket items.

""With costs still heightened and some people still having to adjust to higher mortgage costs, the challenge for consumer spending is whether any future lowering of costs ends up being saved rather than spent,"" KPMG's Linda Ellet added.

10.00am: Gas up 12% over week on supply fears

Natural gas prices have jumped 12% over the course of the last week as concern built over supply.

By Friday morning, UK gas prices had increased from 74.36p per British thermal unit to 83.29p over the week.

This follows an unplanned outage at a major Norwegian plant, with the country key in supplying the rest of Europe.

Flows from Russia to Austria, which still largely relies on Moscow's gas, have also been placed in doubt over a reported foreign court ruling banning payments to Gazprom.

9.42am: Mondi gains on €500 million Eurobond launch

Mondi PLC (LSE:MNDI) enjoyed a bright start to Friday after yesterday's announcement that it had launched a €500 million Eurobond.

""This bond will extend our debt maturity profile and further strengthen the group's liquidity position,"" chief financial officer Mike Powell said.

The bonds include a 3.75% interest rate and are set to mature in 2032.

An application will be made for the securities to be listed on the London Stock Exchange's regulated market, according to the company.

Shares climbed 2.1% to 1,607.50p on the news, placing Mondi among the FTSE 100's biggest daily risers.

The index overall fell 34 points to 8,305 in the meantime.

In a statement, abdrn said that he and the group's board had agreed the time was right for Bird to hand over the reins.

9.18am: UK economic growth to cool this quarter - analyst

UK gross domestic product (GDP) growth will likely cool between April and June against the first quarter, EY analysts say.

After retail sales data came in worse than expected on Friday, EY said GDP growth would be better than April in May but not be as strong over the second quarter, after the UK exited recession earlier this year.

""It's clear that the retail sector is still struggling to generate much momentum,"" EY economist Peter Arnold said.

Sales over the course of April fell 2.3% month-on-month, against a 0.2% decline in March and worse than expectations for a 0.4% drop.

Highlighting softer composite Purchasing Managers' Index data on Thursday, Arnold added: ""It suggests that the UK is likely to see a weaker outturn for GDP growth in Q2, after Q1's very strong performance.""

8.53am: The morning so far

The FTSE 100 index fell as much as 70 points in opening exchanges. Despite a slight recovery, the blue-chip index remained 47 points lower at 8,292 after the first hour of trades.

Retail sales data for April severely undershot forecasts, falling 2.3% month on month.

It follows a 0.2% fall in March and is much worse than the forecasted 0.4% drop, with sales volumes declining across most sectors.

On the company news front, GSK won a high-stake personal injury case in the state of Illinois, US, over its heartburn medication Zantac.

A jury determined that Zantac was not responsible for the plaintiff's colon cancer, with the judge rejecting a request for $640 million in damages. Shares added 0.2%

National Grid was the biggest faller of the morning following yesterday's heavily discounted rights issue.

Speaking of energy, regulator Ofgem has confirmed bills will fall by 7% in July, or £122 on an annualised basis.

The energy price cap will be set at £1,568 for direct debit customers from July to the end of September, down from £1,690 currently, Ofgem said on Friday.

Intertek was among the top risers after the assurance, testing, inspection and certification (ATIC) services provider Intertek provided an upbeat trading update.

The company reported like-for-like (LFL) revenue growth of 7% at constant currency for the first four months of 2024. Shares added 2.1%.

Other top risers in the opening hour included Mondi PLC (LSE:MNDI), Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) and Next plc.

8.25am: Stocks fall

The FTSE 100 index fell 66 points to 8,272 this morning, extending blue-chip losses encountered on Thursday.

National Grid was the biggest faller after Ofgem announced a drop in the energy price cap. DS Smith, St James's Place and Entain were also off.

8.18am: Intertek sent higher following upbeat trading update

Assurance, testing, inspection and certification (ATIC) services provider Intertek provided a ""typically upbeat and ebullient"" trading update today, per the words of Shore Capital Markets.

The company reported like-for-like (LFL) revenue growth of 7% at constant currency for the first four months of 2024.

Divisional growth was strong, with Consumer Products growing by 6.2%, Corporate Assurance by 7.6%, Health and Safety by 9.9%, Industry and Infrastructure by 4.2%, and World of Energy by 9.4%.

""We fundamentally like these 'ATIC' activities... being a necessary and growing element within the global economy, underpinning quality companies' operations,"" said Shore Cap.

Shares added 2.85%.

7.59am: Energy bills to fall by £122

Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed bills will fall by 7% in July, or £122 on an annualised basis.

The energy price cap will be set at £1,568 for direct debit customers from July to the end of September, down from £1,690 currently, Ofgem said on Friday.

This determines how much suppliers can charge per unit of electricity or gas, with these set to cost 22.36p and 5.48p per kilowatt-hour respectively.

Prepayment meter customers will see the cap reduced to £1,522, while it will be set at £1,668 for those on standard credit deals.

""Another fall in the price cap is good news for customers who were facing bills that were hundreds of pounds higher this time last year,"" Energy UK deputy chief executive Dhara Vya commented.

Ofgem's cap had sat at £2,074 last July, on the back of higher energy prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

7.40am: Retail sales fall far short of forecasts

Retail sales in the UK declined 2.3% month-over-month in April 2024.

This follows a 0.2% fall in March and is much worse than the forecasted 0.4% drop. This marks the biggest decrease in retail sales in four months, with sales volumes declining across most sectors.

Sales at non-food stores were down 4.1%, including clothing retailers, sports equipment, games and toys stores, and furniture stores.

Retailers reported poor weather and low footfall as the main reasons for the decline.

Additionally, automotive fuel sales showed their largest monthly fall since October 2021.

Food store sales volumes fell for the third consecutive month, mainly due to supermarkets.

7.33am: GSK wins Zantac trial

British pharmaceuticals big cap GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK) has won a high-stake personal injury case in the state of Illinois, US, over its heartburn medication Zantac.

A jury determined that Zantac was not responsible for the plaintiff's colon cancer, with the judge rejecting a request for $640 million in damages.

""This outcome is consistent with the scientific consensus that there is no consistent or reliable evidence that ranitidine increases the risk of any cancer, supported by 16 epidemiological studies looking at human data regarding the use of ranitidine,"" GSK said in a statement.

""GSK will continue to vigorously defend itself against all other claims,"" said the company.

Angela Valadez, an 89-year-old Illinois resident, claimed that prolonged use of Zantac (ranitidine) caused her to develop colorectal cancer.

The trial was one of the first to go to court among tens of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against Zantac manufacturers, including GSK and Boehringer Ingelheim.

7.18am: FTSE 100 to open lower

The FTSE 100 is set to plummet 69 points to 8,272 when markets open today, extending the 27 points worth of losses encountered on Thursday.

Retail sales severely undershot expectations in the latest quarter, falling 2.7% year on year against an expected 0.2% dip.

It marks the biggest decrease in retail sales in four months, with sales volumes declining across most sectors.

As the joint initiative just turned two, the European Commission released country reports tracking progress.

Diversifying the EU's energy supplies, speeding up the green transition and improving the bloc's energy security are the goals of the REPowerEU plan which celebrated its two-year anniversary recently.

On Tuesday, EU ministers gave final approval to the electricity market reform - also geared towards improving the bloc's energy security. The reform further promotes the expansion of renewable energies and should better protect consumers from escalating electricity prices in the future.

Two years of REPowerEU

Faced with the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022. The plan foresees energy saving goals, the production of clean energy and the diversification of energy supplies - and ultimately ending the dependency on Russian fossil fuels.

Since the adoption of the REPowerEU plan, the EU has successfully reduced gas supplies from Russia. The share of gas from Russia - by pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) - made up 45 percent of all imported gas in 2021, but only 15 percent in 2023. The Union replaced it with gas from other third countries. Norway and the USA have become the largest gas suppliers.

Seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, refined petroleum products and Russian coal imports have been banned through EU sanctions.

Natural gas consumption: How much did member states reduce?

In 27 country reports released for the two-year anniversary of REPowerEU, the European Commission compiled member states' performances between August 2022 and January 2024. Each country report includes a country-specific analysis on a range of points, for example on the key energy figures, diversification of energy supplies, energy price developments or the natural gas demand reduction.

The EU countries had agreed on a voluntary 15 percent reduction target of natural gas consumption and almost all countries have managed to lower their gas consumption. On EU level, the countries achieved a decrease of 18 percent.

21 countries lowered their gas consumption even further than the agreed-upon reduction target, including Denmark (-40%), Finland (-39%), Latvia (-30%), Sweden (-29%), Lithuania (-29%), Estonia (-28%), the Netherlands (-27%), Luxembourg (-26%), Portugal (-23%), Slovakia (-22%), France (-20%), Romania (-19%), Austria (-19%), Hungary (-18%) and Bulgaria (-18%), Italy (-17%), Croatia (-17%), Czechia (-17%), Greece (-16%), Germany (-16%) and Belgium (-16%).

According to the European Commission's data, only five countries did not meet the 15 percent reduction target. Among those are Spain (-12%), Slovenia (-10%), Poland (-8%), Ireland (-4%) and Malta, the only country which increased its gas consumption by ten percent. According to the report, Cyprus does not use natural gas.

Slovenia: Cutting down on consumption, but still reliant on Russian gas

In the case of Slovenia, the REPowerEU report pointed out that while the country 'has taken measures to strengthen alternative supplies of natural gas', it 'effectively remains reliant on Russian gas imported through Austria'.

Data by the Slovenian Energy Agency shows that in 2023 Slovenia imported 68.3 percent of gas from Austria and 28.3 percent from Algeria, through Italy. The agency cannot say with certainty how much of the gas imported from Austria is of Russian origin.

Even though gas importers have not had direct contracts for supply of gas from Russia for 2023 or 2024, the Energy Agency believes that the share of Russian gas was still predominant both in 2023 and in the first part of 2024.

Moving forward on renewables with room for improvement

The EU and its member states are continuously working towards becoming more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels. What have countries achieved so far?

In 2023, according to the European Commission, Portugal for example installed around 1.3 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity, bringing the total to 18.4 gigawatts - in comparison to 5.1 gigawatts in 2021. Additionally, the annual growth rate of installed renewable energy capacity increased to 7.6 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2021. However, the country's energy mix still included 69 percent fossil fuels in 2022.

Neighbouring Spain accelerated its transition towards a decarbonised energy system. According to Spanish grid operator Red Electrica, renewables accounted for 65.2 percent of the Spanish electricity mix in March - an all-time high. Still, the REPowerEU Spain report states that fossil fuels continue to play a central role in the country's energy system, representing 70.1 percent of primary energy imported in 2021.

Croatia quickly deduced its dependence on Russian gas imports by increasing its own production and intensifying the use of the existing LNG terminal. However, Croatia is still highly dependent on energy imports from countries outside the EU. Fossil fuels also continue to play an important role in Croatia's energy mix, as they accounted for 72 percent of gross available energy in 2022.

Moving into a greener direction, the country could soon start to produce green hydrogen: INA, the leading Croatian oil and gas company, recently signed two contracts related to renewable energy projects - one for the production of green hydrogen and the other for a bio-methane production facility. The completion of the construction of both plants is expected in 2026. The green hydrogen project, together with its solar plant and logistic capacity, will be co-financed via the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

The EU's RRF is a tool providing grants and loans to support reforms and investments in member states. It should, among other things, help member states become more sustainable, boost progress with the green and digital transition and achieve the EU target of climate neutrality by 2050.

...just hang on for a year

In Bulgaria, one of the major national energy reforms has been postponed by a year, which means the artificial maintenance of coal capacity will remain for at least another twelve months. This, in turn, could lead to the country not receiving the expected 1.3 billion BNG (around 665.15 million Euro) under the Bulgarian National Recovery and Resilience Plan which is funded under the EU's RFF. The energy reform is a mandatory requirement.

While Bulgarian MPs justified this citing a lack of readiness to switch from a regulated to a free electricity market or funds, several media outlets and experts attributed the decision mostly to pre-election populism.

A reformed energy market for security and a green future

This week, the electricity market reform took its final hurdle after representatives from EU member states and the European Parliament had signed off on the market reforms last December.

Belgium's Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten described the day as a 'milestone for the EU' on the path to a carbon-free and greener future. 'By adopting the electricity market reform, we are empowering consumers, ensuring security of supply and paving the way for a more stable, predictable and sustainable energy market.'

New long-term contracts between governments and electricity producers, under which the state would chip in if the market price drops below an agreed price, are central to the reform efforts.This is meant to incentivise domestic green and nuclear power production by ensuring a return on investments.

It also protects consumers who, in the future, have the right to both fixed-price contracts and contracts with dynamic prices. This would allow consumers to opt for both secure, long-term prices and contracts with changing prices if they want to take advantage of price fluctuations - for example, to use electricity when it is cheaper for charging electric cars or for heat pumps.

How does the electricity market work?

The electricity market in the EU works according to the merit-order principle, defining the order in which power plants connected to the electricity exchange are used to deliver energy and to determine the market price.

Those that can produce electricity at relatively low marginal cost, like wind farms, are used first to cover demand. But as demand rises beyond those initial sources' capabilities, higher marginal cost sources are used.

The final price therefore depends on which sources need to be used to meet demand, as well as fluctuations in the costs of using those sources. For example, a surge in natural gas prices raises the cost of using gas-fired power plants. (AGERPRES: RO - editors: Mariana Ionescu, Cristina Zaharia)

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO) looked to solidify its spot as Friday's top FTSE 100 riser, climbing by 4.6% to 368.30p.

Though weak retail sales data for April looked to highlight the ongoing cost pressures consumers faced, analysts seemed optimistic things could improve for the sector soon.

""Weak retail figures shouldn't have surprised given the miserable weather we've had for much of 2024,"" AJ Bell's Russ Mould noted.

""The sooner interest rates are cut, the better, as far as investors are concerned.

""Not only should that make consumers feel a bit more confident about their finances, but it should also put businesses in a stronger position to increase investment.""

Analysts had highlighted subsiding inflation and growing wages as reasons for optimism earlier in the day.

B&Q owner Kingfisher PLC (LSE:KGF) and Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LSE:MKS) also held onto gains in late trading.

The FTSE 100 as a whole fell by 11 points to 8,327 during the day, though, weighed down by the likes of utilities.

""This comes as Severn Trent, the water utility company, reported stronger than expected earnings earlier this week,"" XTB's Kathleen Brooks explained.

""The stock rose to a 5-month high earlier this week, however, it has experienced a sharp selloff, as the market focuses once more on the challenges facing the water sector as it struggles to maintain clean rivers and waterways with the changing, wetter weather in the UK.""

3.00pm: AJ Bell slips as boss sells £28mln worth of shares

AJ Bell slipped 3% on Friday on news chief executive Andy Bell had sold £28.1 million worth of shares in the online investment company.

Bell sold 7.5 million shares at 375p each, marking a 7% discount to Thursday's closing price, a regulatory filing showed.

Bell has been left with an 18.7% stake in AJ Bell, which he founded, following the move.

This came after shares in the company jumped on Thursday following results showing a 47% jump in pre tax profit to £61.4 million, reflecting an improved margin of 46.8%.

Director Billy Mackay and chief technology officer Amber Tagari have also sold parts of their stakes in AJ Bell, another filing on Thursday showed.

Shares fell 3.9% to 387.28p.

2.43pm: Positive start on Wall Street

Wall Street enjoyed a positive start as trading got underway on Friday.

The Nasdaq was up 64 points after the opening bell, reversing falls seen on Thursday despite NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD)'s rally after beating first-quarter expectations.

The Dow Jones and S&P 500 also climbed, by 64 and 18 points respectively, after slipping alongside the Nasdaq earlier on in the week.

Thursday drop ""was triggered by expectations the Fed's first interest rate cut could [be] delayed by several further months, after a much stronger-than-expected US business activity ended a run of soft data releases,"" City Index's Fawad Razaqzada explained.

Attention turned to durable goods orders, due on Friday afternoon, while Federal Reserve governor Cristopher Waller is also set to speak later on.

""Markets [are] hoping for weakness given the 'good news is bad news' construct highlighted by yesterday's PMI release,"" Scope Markets analyst Joshua Mahony added.

""With the FOMC minutes highlighting a mixed range of views that included the potential to hike rates further, any pop in the core durable goods orders figure could further drive risk-off sentiment given the implications for monetary policy.""

1.55pm: Thames Water to wait longer for decision on bill hike plan

More on Thames Water and Ofwat has reportedly pushed back its review of the supplier's plan to hike bills.

According to the Telegraph, the date by which Ofwat will approve or block the plan has been changed from June 12 to July 11.

Such plan would see Thames Water hike bills by 45% over the coming years as it grapples with high debt and plans £19.8 billion of investment for 2025 to 2030.

Thames has appeared on the brink of collapse, with payments to bondholders being defaulted on, board members quitting and plans reportedly being drawn up to unload £500 million worth of loans onto the market most recently... Read more

1.43pm: Retailers climb despite poor April sales

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), Kingfisher PLC (LSE:KGF) and Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LSE:MKS) were among the FTSE 100's top risers into Friday afternoon.

Up 1.7%, 1.2% and 0.9%, gains came despite worse-than-expected retail sales data for April earlier in the day.

Analysts subsequently noted sales should tick up in the coming months as the likes of lower inflation and growing wages help to deepen consumer pockets.

Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES) topped the day's losers, down 2.5%, while Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY), St James's Place PLC and Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) also fell.

""European equity markets are on track for their worst weekly performance in three weeks, as risk sentiment sours and interest rate bets get pushed back once again,"" XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks said.

""Stronger than expected CPI in the UK, an increase in negotiated wage growth in the first quarter for the Eurozone, hawkish Fed minutes in the US and strong PMI data have all contributed to a 'risk off' tone to markets, even though Nvidia's monster results suggest that the AI boom still has much further to go.""

1.14pm: Wall Street to open higher

Futures contracts are pointing to a bullish start to Friday for the US markets, with the Nasdaq 100 tipped to open 54 points above yesterday's close.

The broader S&P 500 index is set to open 15 points higher at 5,283.

Following yesterday's blockbuster earnings report, chipmaker NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is expected to add another percentage point after rally to an all-time high yesterday.

Things are quieter on the company news front today, with attention turning to durable goods orders and consumer sentiment on the macroeconomic calendar.

12.57pm: Thames Water lender seeking to offload £500mln

A lender to crisis-struck utilities provider Thames Water is seeking to offload £500 million worth of loans onto the market, according to a Bloomberg report citing ""people with knowledge of the matter"".

The lender is also hoping to offload £100 million in bonds, according to the report.

Amid financial stress and a walloping £16 billion debt pile, Thames Water's bonds have plummeted to just 5.8p on the pound.

Though this presents a steal for potential buyers who may be more optimistic about Thames Water's prospects than market pricings suggest, the company's troubles are manifold.

Parent company Kemble's debt was heavily discounted after defaulting on £400 million of bonds in April, with recent turmoil among the board of directors adding to the woes.

Thames Water's largest shareholder Omers Infrastructure withdrew its board representative last week, with more board members subsequently quitting this week.

Omers fully wrote down its 31.7% stake in Kemble, calling the utility ""worthless"" and ""uninvestable"".

12.25pm: Bitcoin, Ethereum down despite landmark ETF approval

Bitcoin (BTC) fell for the fourth day in a row on Friday, wiping out the majority of the gains penned on Monday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency closed 1.7% on Thursday, with the BTC/USD pair dipping another 0.8% this morning.

Attention has firmly shifted to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, following spot-ether approvals in the US.

Speaking on the development, ETC Group suggested that the regulatory nod, which effectively brings ether to the mainstream stock market, will result in approximately $1.65 billion of ""potential"" net inflows in the first three months of trading.

""The approval marks a significant shift in sentiment within the SEC and among US regulators in general but US investors still received inferior investment vehicles compared to European vehicles,"" said ETC Group.

It may take a few months for the ETF products to officially launch, ETC Group suggested. Once they do, ETC Group suggested a potential 92% increase on the ETH/USD pair.

At the time of writing, ETH/USD was swapping for $3,706, over 22% higher week on week.

Interestingly, the pair dipped 2% following the SEC's approval, suggesting the event was already priced in.

12.03pm: Things can only get better (apart from standing charges)

D:Ream's early-90s hit found itself a new lease on life after drowning out Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's damp election announcement on Thursday, but things are getting better for personal finances too.

That's according to interactive investor's senior personal finance expert Myron Jobson, who said that Ofgem's decision to drop the energy price cap ""adds to a growing sense that things are getting better for personal finances"".

There are caveats though.

""The harsh reality is many aren't feeling it,"" stated Jobson. ""The substantial jump in the cost of renting and high mortgage rates have come at a high cost in pounds and pence terms. The savings from the fall in the energy price cap won't touch the sides of what's needed to offset the heightened housing cost burden for many households.

""Energy bills have thankfully come down after reaching record highs in 2022. However, households are still set to pay 44% more, or £484 on average, than they did three years ago in summer 2021, before the energy price shock caused mainly by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Jobson highlighted standing charges as a ""thorny issue"" affecting energy consumers. ""They are applied to gas and electricity bills regardless of whether customers have used any energy, which makes it harder for people to save money by using less energy.""

11.38am: Nvidia price cuts

Briefly looking stateside, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) has reduced prices on some of its high-end AI chips in China by up to 20%, according to an exclusive report by Reuters.

This move is seen as a strategic effort to remain competitive against Huawei, a major Chinese tech company.

The price cut specifically affects the A800 chip, which Nvidia developed as an alternative to the A100 chip.

Nvidia began shipping the A800 chip to mainland China after the Biden administration's export ban on the cutting-edge A100 chip.

US tech sanctions against China aim to curb the Communist Party's development of military-grade AI technology, but they are also causing challenges for Nvidia.

During the company's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, senior Nvidia executives cautioned about ""substantially"" lower sales in China due to the export restrictions.

""Our data center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October,"" said Colette Kress, chief financial officer. ""We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.""

Despite these challenges in China, Nvidia surpassed analysts' expectations with a significant earnings beat, boosting the chipmaking giant's valuation by hundreds of billions of dollars.

11.16am: St James's Place FTSE 100's biggest loser after Hargreaves bid-fuelled rally

St James's Place PLC emerged as the FTSE 100's biggest loser on Friday, falling 3.1% after having climbed on news of a bid for rival Hargreaves Lansdown.

Hargreaves itself was down 5% on Friday, after spiking on news of the rejected £4.7 billion bid by CVC Capital Partners, Nordic Capital and a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

The consortium subsequently said another ""possible offer"" was being considered, adding a ""further announcement will be made as and when appropriate"".

HL's second-largest individual shareholder Stephen Lansdown said the bid had ""woken the stock up"" in the meantime.

HL had jumped 14% on Thursday, while peer St James's Place gained 5%.

""It's interesting to see that third parties are now seeing the value in Hargreaves Lansdown and looking to take advantage of it,"" he added.

The FTSE 100 ticked down 28 points to 8,310, as Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES), Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY) and Experian (LSE:EXPN) PLC were among others to also fall.

11.01am: Oil slips as OPEC delays meeting

Oil prices dropped on Friday on news major oil-producing nations, or OPEC+, had pushed back their latest meeting to discuss supply cuts.

Benchmark Brent Crude fell 2% to US$80.74 a barrel, having peaked above US$90 in early April.

Having committed to cuts of around 2.2 million barrels daily collectively this year, OPEC+ delayed the date of its next meeting by a day to June 2.

This comes against the backdrop of increasing output from the United States, alongside fears over demand due to high interest rates globally.

10.33am: Consumer confidence grows in May

Consumer confidence indicators have improved this month, driven by a better outlook for personal finances, GfK has reported.

The Consumer Confidence Index climbed by two points in May to minus-17, the firm said on Friday.

This was as forecasts for personal finances over the coming year rose strongly by five points to positive seven.

""With the latest drop in headline inflation and the prospect of interest rate cuts in due course, the trend is certainly positive,"" GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said.

""All in all, consumers are clearly sensing that conditions are improving.""

He did highlight a reduction in GfK's major purchase measure, however, highlighting reduced confidence over buying big-ticket items.

""With costs still heightened and some people still having to adjust to higher mortgage costs, the challenge for consumer spending is whether any future lowering of costs ends up being saved rather than spent,"" KPMG's Linda Ellet added.

10.00am: Gas up 12% over week on supply fears

Natural gas prices have jumped 12% over the course of the last week as concern built over supply.

By Friday morning, UK gas prices had increased from 74.36p per British thermal unit to 83.29p over the week.

This follows an unplanned outage at a major Norwegian plant, with the country key in supplying the rest of Europe.

Flows from Russia to Austria, which still largely relies on Moscow's gas, have also been placed in doubt over a reported foreign court ruling banning payments to Gazprom.

9.42am: Mondi gains on €500 million Eurobond launch

Mondi PLC (LSE:MNDI) enjoyed a bright start to Friday after yesterday's announcement that it had launched a €500 million Eurobond.

""This bond will extend our debt maturity profile and further strengthen the group's liquidity position,"" chief financial officer Mike Powell said.

The bonds include a 3.75% interest rate and are set to mature in 2032.

An application will be made for the securities to be listed on the London Stock Exchange's regulated market, according to the company.

Shares climbed 2.1% to 1,607.50p on the news, placing Mondi among the FTSE 100's biggest daily risers.

The index overall fell 34 points to 8,305 in the meantime.

9.18am: UK economic growth to cool this quarter - analyst

UK gross domestic product (GDP) growth will likely cool between April and June against the first quarter, EY analysts say.

After retail sales data came in worse than expected on Friday, EY said GDP growth would be better than April in May but not be as strong over the second quarter, after the UK exited recession earlier this year.

""It's clear that the retail sector is still struggling to generate much momentum,"" EY economist Peter Arnold said.

Sales over the course of April fell 2.3% month-on-month, against a 0.2% decline in March and worse than expectations for a 0.4% drop.

Highlighting softer composite Purchasing Managers' Index data on Thursday, Arnold added: ""It suggests that the UK is likely to see a weaker outturn for GDP growth in Q2, after Q1's very strong performance.""

8.53am: The morning so far

The FTSE 100 index fell as much as 70 points in opening exchanges. Despite a slight recovery, the blue-chip index remained 47 points lower at 8,292 after the first hour of trades.

Retail sales data for April severely undershot forecasts, falling 2.3% month on month.

It follows a 0.2% fall in March and is much worse than the forecasted 0.4% drop, with sales volumes declining across most sectors.

On the company news front, GSK won a high-stake personal injury case in the state of Illinois, US, over its heartburn medication Zantac.

A jury determined that Zantac was not responsible for the plaintiff's colon cancer, with the judge rejecting a request for $640 million in damages. Shares added 0.2%

National Grid was the biggest faller of the morning following yesterday's heavily discounted rights issue.

Speaking of energy, regulator Ofgem has confirmed bills will fall by 7% in July, or £122 on an annualised basis.

The energy price cap will be set at £1,568 for direct debit customers from July to the end of September, down from £1,690 currently, Ofgem said on Friday.

Intertek was among the top risers after the assurance, testing, inspection and certification (ATIC) services provider Intertek provided an upbeat trading update.

The company reported like-for-like (LFL) revenue growth of 7% at constant currency for the first four months of 2024. Shares added 2.1%.

Other top risers in the opening hour included Mondi PLC (LSE:MNDI), Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) and Next plc.

8.25am: Stocks fall

The FTSE 100 index fell 66 points to 8,272 this morning, extending blue-chip losses encountered on Thursday.

National Grid was the biggest faller after Ofgem announced a drop in the energy price cap. DS Smith, St James's Place and Entain were also off.

8.18am: Intertek sent higher following upbeat trading update

Assurance, testing, inspection and certification (ATIC) services provider Intertek provided a ""typically upbeat and ebullient"" trading update today, per the words of Shore Capital Markets.

The company reported like-for-like (LFL) revenue growth of 7% at constant currency for the first four months of 2024.

Divisional growth was strong, with Consumer Products growing by 6.2%, Corporate Assurance by 7.6%, Health and Safety by 9.9%, Industry and Infrastructure by 4.2%, and World of Energy by 9.4%.

""We fundamentally like these 'ATIC' activities... being a necessary and growing element within the global economy, underpinning quality companies' operations,"" said Shore Cap.

Shares added 2.85%.

7.59am: Energy bills to fall by £122

Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed bills will fall by 7% in July, or £122 on an annualised basis.

The energy price cap will be set at £1,568 for direct debit customers from July to the end of September, down from £1,690 currently, Ofgem said on Friday.

This determines how much suppliers can charge per unit of electricity or gas, with these set to cost 22.36p and 5.48p per kilowatt-hour respectively.

Prepayment meter customers will see the cap reduced to £1,522, while it will be set at £1,668 for those on standard credit deals.

""Another fall in the price cap is good news for customers who were facing bills that were hundreds of pounds higher this time last year,"" Energy UK deputy chief executive Dhara Vya commented.

Ofgem's cap had sat at £2,074 last July, on the back of higher energy prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

7.40am: Retail sales fall far short of forecasts

Retail sales in the UK declined 2.3% month-over-month in April 2024.

This follows a 0.2% fall in March and is much worse than the forecasted 0.4% drop. This marks the biggest decrease in retail sales in four months, with sales volumes declining across most sectors.

Sales at non-food stores were down 4.1%, including clothing retailers, sports equipment, games and toys stores, and furniture stores.

Retailers reported poor weather and low footfall as the main reasons for the decline.

Additionally, automotive fuel sales showed their largest monthly fall since October 2021.

Food store sales volumes fell for the third consecutive month, mainly due to supermarkets.

7.33am: GSK wins Zantac trial

British pharmaceuticals big cap GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK) has won a high-stake personal injury case in the state of Illinois, US, over its heartburn medication Zantac.

A jury determined that Zantac was not responsible for the plaintiff's colon cancer, with the judge rejecting a request for $640 million in damages.

""This outcome is consistent with the scientific consensus that there is no consistent or reliable evidence that ranitidine increases the risk of any cancer, supported by 16 epidemiological studies looking at human data regarding the use of ranitidine,"" GSK said in a statement.

""GSK will continue to vigorously defend itself against all other claims,"" said the company.

Angela Valadez, an 89-year-old Illinois resident, claimed that prolonged use of Zantac (ranitidine) caused her to develop colorectal cancer.

The trial was one of the first to go to court among tens of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against Zantac manufacturers, including GSK and Boehringer Ingelheim.

7.18am: FTSE 100 to open lower

The FTSE 100 is set to plummet 69 points to 8,272 when markets open today, extending the 27 points worth of losses encountered on Thursday.

Retail sales severely undershot expectations in the latest quarter, falling 2.7% year on year against an expected 0.2% dip.

It marks the biggest decrease in retail sales in four months, with sales volumes declining across most sectors.

AJ Bell slipped 3% on Friday on news chief executive Andy Bell had sold £28.1 million worth of shares in the online investment company.

Bell sold 7.5 million shares at 375p each, marking a 7% discount to Thursday's closing price, a regulatory filing showed.

Bell has been left with an 18.7% stake in AJ Bell, which he founded, following the move.

This came after shares in the company jumped on Thursday following results showing a 47% jump in pre tax profit to £61.4 million, reflecting an improved margin of 46.8%.

Director Billy Mackay and chief technology officer Amber Tagari have also sold parts of their stakes in AJ Bell, another filing on Thursday showed.

Shares fell 3.9% to 387.28p.

2.43pm: Positive start on Wall Street

Wall Street enjoyed a positive start as trading got underway on Friday.

The Nasdaq was up 64 points after the opening bell, reversing falls seen on Thursday despite NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD)'s rally after beating first-quarter expectations.

The Dow Jones and S&P 500 also climbed, by 64 and 18 points respectively, after slipping alongside the Nasdaq earlier on in the week.

Thursday drop ""was triggered by expectations the Fed's first interest rate cut could [be] delayed by several further months, after a much stronger-than-expected US business activity ended a run of soft data releases,"" City Index's Fawad Razaqzada explained.

Attention turned to durable goods orders, due on Friday afternoon, while Federal Reserve governor Cristopher Waller is also set to speak later on.

""Markets [are] hoping for weakness given the 'good news is bad news' construct highlighted by yesterday's PMI release,"" Scope Markets analyst Joshua Mahony added.

""With the FOMC minutes highlighting a mixed range of views that included the potential to hike rates further, any pop in the core durable goods orders figure could further drive risk-off sentiment given the implications for monetary policy.""

1.55pm: Thames Water to wait longer for decision on bill hike plan

More on Thames Water and Ofwat has reportedly pushed back its review of the supplier's plan to hike bills.

According to the Telegraph, the date by which Ofwat will approve or block the plan has been changed from June 12 to July 11.

Such plan would see Thames Water hike bills by 45% over the coming years as it grapples with high debt and plans £19.8 billion of investment for 2025 to 2030.

Thames has appeared on the brink of collapse, with payments to bondholders being defaulted on, board members quitting and plans reportedly being drawn up to unload £500 million worth of loans onto the market most recently... Read more

1.43pm: Retailers climb despite poor April sales

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), Kingfisher PLC (LSE:KGF) and Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LSE:MKS) were among the FTSE 100's top risers into Friday afternoon.

Up 1.7%, 1.2% and 0.9%, gains came despite worse-than-expected retail sales data for April earlier in the day.

Analysts subsequently noted sales should tick up in the coming months as the likes of lower inflation and growing wages help to deepen consumer pockets.

Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES) topped the day's losers, down 2.5%, while Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY), St James's Place PLC and Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) also fell.

""European equity markets are on track for their worst weekly performance in three weeks, as risk sentiment sours and interest rate bets get pushed back once again,"" XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks said.

""Stronger than expected CPI in the UK, an increase in negotiated wage growth in the first quarter for the Eurozone, hawkish Fed minutes in the US and strong PMI data have all contributed to a 'risk off' tone to markets, even though Nvidia's monster results suggest that the AI boom still has much further to go.""

1.14pm: Wall Street to open higher

Futures contracts are pointing to a bullish start to Friday for the US markets, with the Nasdaq 100 tipped to open 54 points above yesterday's close.

The broader S&P 500 index is set to open 15 points higher at 5,283.

Following yesterday's blockbuster earnings report, chipmaker NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is expected to add another percentage point after rally to an all-time high yesterday.

Things are quieter on the company news front today, with attention turning to durable goods orders and consumer sentiment on the macroeconomic calendar.

12.57pm: Thames Water lender seeking to offload £500mln

A lender to crisis-struck utilities provider Thames Water is seeking to offload £500 million worth of loans onto the market, according to a Bloomberg report citing ""people with knowledge of the matter"".

The lender is also hoping to offload £100 million in bonds, according to the report.

Amid financial stress and a walloping £16 billion debt pile, Thames Water's bonds have plummeted to just 5.8p on the pound.

Though this presents a steal for potential buyers who may be more optimistic about Thames Water's prospects than market pricings suggest, the company's troubles are manifold.

Parent company Kemble's debt was heavily discounted after defaulting on £400 million of bonds in April, with recent turmoil among the board of directors adding to the woes.

Thames Water's largest shareholder Omers Infrastructure withdrew its board representative last week, with more board members subsequently quitting this week.

Omers fully wrote down its 31.7% stake in Kemble, calling the utility ""worthless"" and ""uninvestable"".

12.25pm: Bitcoin, Ethereum down despite landmark ETF approval

Bitcoin (BTC) fell for the fourth day in a row on Friday, wiping out the majority of the gains penned on Monday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency closed 1.7% on Thursday, with the BTC/USD pair dipping another 0.8% this morning.

Attention has firmly shifted to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, following spot-ether approvals in the US.

Speaking on the development, ETC Group suggested that the regulatory nod, which effectively brings ether to the mainstream stock market, will result in approximately $1.65 billion of ""potential"" net inflows in the first three months of trading.

""The approval marks a significant shift in sentiment within the SEC and among US regulators in general but US investors still received inferior investment vehicles compared to European vehicles,"" said ETC Group.

It may take a few months for the ETF products to officially launch, ETC Group suggested. Once they do, ETC Group suggested a potential 92% increase on the ETH/USD pair.

At the time of writing, ETH/USD was swapping for $3,706, over 22% higher week on week.

Interestingly, the pair dipped 2% following the SEC's approval, suggesting the event was already priced in.

12.03pm: Things can only get better (apart from standing charges)

D:Ream's early-90s hit found itself a new lease on life after drowning out Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's damp election announcement on Thursday, but things are getting better for personal finances too.

That's according to interactive investor's senior personal finance expert Myron Jobson, who said that Ofgem's decision to drop the energy price cap ""adds to a growing sense that things are getting better for personal finances"".

There are caveats though.

""The harsh reality is many aren't feeling it,"" stated Jobson. ""The substantial jump in the cost of renting and high mortgage rates have come at a high cost in pounds and pence terms. The savings from the fall in the energy price cap won't touch the sides of what's needed to offset the heightened housing cost burden for many households.

""Energy bills have thankfully come down after reaching record highs in 2022. However, households are still set to pay 44% more, or £484 on average, than they did three years ago in summer 2021, before the energy price shock caused mainly by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Jobson highlighted standing charges as a ""thorny issue"" affecting energy consumers. ""They are applied to gas and electricity bills regardless of whether customers have used any energy, which makes it harder for people to save money by using less energy.""

11.38am: Nvidia price cuts

Briefly looking stateside, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) has reduced prices on some of its high-end AI chips in China by up to 20%, according to an exclusive report by Reuters.

This move is seen as a strategic effort to remain competitive against Huawei, a major Chinese tech company.

The price cut specifically affects the A800 chip, which Nvidia developed as an alternative to the A100 chip.

Nvidia began shipping the A800 chip to mainland China after the Biden administration's export ban on the cutting-edge A100 chip.

US tech sanctions against China aim to curb the Communist Party's development of military-grade AI technology, but they are also causing challenges for Nvidia.

During the company's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, senior Nvidia executives cautioned about ""substantially"" lower sales in China due to the export restrictions.

""Our data center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October,"" said Colette Kress, chief financial officer. ""We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.""

Despite these challenges in China, Nvidia surpassed analysts' expectations with a significant earnings beat, boosting the chipmaking giant's valuation by hundreds of billions of dollars.

11.16am: St James's Place FTSE 100's biggest loser after Hargreaves bid-fuelled rally

St James's Place PLC emerged as the FTSE 100's biggest loser on Friday, falling 3.1% after having climbed on news of a bid for rival Hargreaves Lansdown.

Hargreaves itself was down 5% on Friday, after spiking on news of the rejected £4.7 billion bid by CVC Capital Partners, Nordic Capital and a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

The consortium subsequently said another ""possible offer"" was being considered, adding a ""further announcement will be made as and when appropriate"".

HL's second-largest individual shareholder Stephen Lansdown said the bid had ""woken the stock up"" in the meantime.

HL had jumped 14% on Thursday, while peer St James's Place gained 5%.

""It's interesting to see that third parties are now seeing the value in Hargreaves Lansdown and looking to take advantage of it,"" he added.

The FTSE 100 ticked down 28 points to 8,310, as Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES), Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY) and Experian (LSE:EXPN) PLC were among others to also fall.

11.01am: Oil slips as OPEC delays meeting

Oil prices dropped on Friday on news major oil-producing nations, or OPEC+, had pushed back their latest meeting to discuss supply cuts.

Benchmark Brent Crude fell 2% to US$80.74 a barrel, having peaked above US$90 in early April.

Having committed to cuts of around 2.2 million barrels daily collectively this year, OPEC+ delayed the date of its next meeting by a day to June 2.

This comes against the backdrop of increasing output from the United States, alongside fears over demand due to high interest rates globally.

10.33am: Consumer confidence grows in May

Consumer confidence indicators have improved this month, driven by a better outlook for personal finances, GfK has reported.

The Consumer Confidence Index climbed by two points in May to minus-17, the firm said on Friday.

This was as forecasts for personal finances over the coming year rose strongly by five points to positive seven.

""With the latest drop in headline inflation and the prospect of interest rate cuts in due course, the trend is certainly positive,"" GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said.

""All in all, consumers are clearly sensing that conditions are improving.""

He did highlight a reduction in GfK's major purchase measure, however, highlighting reduced confidence over buying big-ticket items.

""With costs still heightened and some people still having to adjust to higher mortgage costs, the challenge for consumer spending is whether any future lowering of costs ends up being saved rather than spent,"" KPMG's Linda Ellet added.

10.00am: Gas up 12% over week on supply fears

Natural gas prices have jumped 12% over the course of the last week as concern built over supply.

By Friday morning, UK gas prices had increased from 74.36p per British thermal unit to 83.29p over the week.

This follows an unplanned outage at a major Norwegian plant, with the country key in supplying the rest of Europe.

Flows from Russia to Austria, which still largely relies on Moscow's gas, have also been placed in doubt over a reported foreign court ruling banning payments to Gazprom.

9.42am: Mondi gains on €500 million Eurobond launch

Mondi PLC (LSE:MNDI) enjoyed a bright start to Friday after yesterday's announcement that it had launched a €500 million Eurobond.

""This bond will extend our debt maturity profile and further strengthen the group's liquidity position,"" chief financial officer Mike Powell said.

The bonds include a 3.75% interest rate and are set to mature in 2032.

An application will be made for the securities to be listed on the London Stock Exchange's regulated market, according to the company.

Shares climbed 2.1% to 1,607.50p on the news, placing Mondi among the FTSE 100's biggest daily risers.

The index overall fell 34 points to 8,305 in the meantime.

9.18am: UK economic growth to cool this quarter - analyst

UK gross domestic product (GDP) growth will likely cool between April and June against the first quarter, EY analysts say.

After retail sales data came in worse than expected on Friday, EY said GDP growth would be better than April in May but not be as strong over the second quarter, after the UK exited recession earlier this year.

""It's clear that the retail sector is still struggling to generate much momentum,"" EY economist Peter Arnold said.

Sales over the course of April fell 2.3% month-on-month, against a 0.2% decline in March and worse than expectations for a 0.4% drop.

Highlighting softer composite Purchasing Managers' Index data on Thursday, Arnold added: ""It suggests that the UK is likely to see a weaker outturn for GDP growth in Q2, after Q1's very strong performance.""

8.53am: The morning so far

The FTSE 100 index fell as much as 70 points in opening exchanges. Despite a slight recovery, the blue-chip index remained 47 points lower at 8,292 after the first hour of trades.

Retail sales data for April severely undershot forecasts, falling 2.3% month on month.

It follows a 0.2% fall in March and is much worse than the forecasted 0.4% drop, with sales volumes declining across most sectors.

On the company news front, GSK won a high-stake personal injury case in the state of Illinois, US, over its heartburn medication Zantac.

8.18am: Intertek sent higher following upbeat trading update

Assurance, testing, inspection and certification (ATIC) services provider Intertek provided a ""typically upbeat and ebullient"" trading update today, per the words of Shore Capital Markets.

The company reported like-for-like (LFL) revenue growth of 7% at constant currency for the first four months of 2024.

Divisional growth was strong, with Consumer Products growing by 6.2%, Corporate Assurance by 7.6%, Health and Safety by 9.9%, Industry and Infrastructure by 4.2%, and World of Energy by 9.4%.

""We fundamentally like these 'ATIC' activities... being a necessary and growing element within the global economy, underpinning quality companies' operations,"" said Shore Cap.

Shares added 2.85%.

7.59am: Energy bills to fall by £122

Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed bills will fall by 7% in July, or £122 on an annualised basis.

The energy price cap will be set at £1,568 for direct debit customers from July to the end of September, down from £1,690 currently, Ofgem said on Friday.

This determines how much suppliers can charge per unit of electricity or gas, with these set to cost 22.36p and 5.48p per kilowatt-hour respectively.

Prepayment meter customers will see the cap reduced to £1,522, while it will be set at £1,668 for those on standard credit deals.

""Another fall in the price cap is good news for customers who were facing bills that were hundreds of pounds higher this time last year,"" Energy UK deputy chief executive Dhara Vya commented.

Ofgem's cap had sat at £2,074 last July, on the back of higher energy prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

7.40am: Retail sales fall far short of forecasts

Millions of tonnes of fossil hydrogen are produced in the European Union using natural gas as a feedstock, resulting in roughly 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions for every tonne of hydrogen. Production of hydrogen using water and renewable electricity can eliminate those emissions, but currently costs substantially more. To bridge some of that cost gap, or 'green premium', the EU has developed the European Hydrogen Bank (EHB), a subsidy mechanism to support the production of renewable hydrogen, aiming to increase private investment within the EU and globally.

The EHB is a 'pay-as-bid' auction mechanism, with prospective hydrogen producers bidding for a fixed subsidy per kilogramme of renewable hydrogen produced. Importantly, all bids must include credible evidence of preliminary contractual agreements with buyers. The first auction closed on 30 April 2024 and allocated €720 million to seven renewable hydrogen projects, with an additional €2.2 billion reserved for a second auction.

Winning bids were lower than expected. This means the EHB pot can support greater volumes than anticipated, though these volumes remain very small in the context of political targets.The low bids also imply some buyers are willing to pay a large share of the 'green premium' for renewable hydrogen over fossil hydrogen.

Notably, winning bids all originated from the Iberian Peninsula or the Nordics, areas with competitive renewable energy resources. This suggests a strong investment pull effect from renewable availability.

Political ambition exceeds joint funding reality

Assuming that winning projects go ahead and similar bids are submitted in the second auction round later this year, the EHB's endowment of €3 billion should translate into annual production of around 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of renewable hydrogen by 2030 (with 6GW of electrolyser capacity). For context, the 2020 EU Hydrogen Strategy set a target to produce 10Mt of renewable hydrogen by 2030.

Specific and binding sectoral targets were agreed by the European Council in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED, EU/2023/2413) (Robinson and Laurencin, 2023). For industry (like ammonia producers), 42.5 percent of the hydrogen supply must be renewable by 2030. Renewable hydrogen products should constitute at least 1 percent of fuel supplied to the transport sector by 2030. We calculate that these obligations amount to roughly 4Mt of clean hydrogen demand, based on current fuel demand in these sectors.

Large private companies' willingness to pay for renewable hydrogen

The cost of producing renewable hydrogen in Europe exceeds that of fossil (natural gas-based) hydrogen by between €4 and €6 per kilogramme. The EHB set a first-round subsidy ceiling price of €4.50/kg, roughly equivalent to the green premium needed for the most competitive projects. However, the winning bids were less than 10 percent of this, at an average of €0.40/kg, meaning that the remaining 90 percent of the green premium is being covered by the end consumer and some other supply-side support we will discuss later. We can infer from these results that some European buyers are willing to pay a substantial premium for renewable hydrogen over fossil hydrogen.

This is good news for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that renewable hydrogen does not need to reach price parity with fossil hydrogen (or even close) to begin displacing meaningful volumes of the fossil incumbent. Second, the burden of narrowing that cost gap does not need to be carried solely by public funds.

For context, the winning bid prices in the EHB auction were a fraction of the roughly €11/kg subsidy for winning bids in the UK's latest renewable hydrogen auction round, and well below the United States tax credit of $3/kg, which was created under the Inflation Reduction Act. This preliminary information suggests that the EU is getting very good value from its limited funds. The use of a competitive auction design helps, with projects receiving what they 'need' rather than what they 'want'. Regulations that require existing fossil hydrogen consumers to switch to renewable hydrogen (ie the RED) also help.

Two caveats apply here. First, European projects receive further non-Hydrogen Bank financial support. From 2025, renewable hydrogen producers will be considered like their fossil counterparts in the EU emissions trading system (ETS). Consequently, they will receive a share of free carbon allowances. Fossil hydrogen producers must use the allowances to compensate for their carbon emissions, but for renewable producers with no emissions to declare, these allowances can be sold for profit. The action is intended to create a level playing field whilst allowing the carbon price to function. We calculate that these could be worth roughly €0.7/kg based on recent ETS prices, although the number of free credits allocated will already begin to be phased down from 2026.

Second, the winning bids from this first auction round should be operational by 2028 and therefore exempt for 10 years from the obligation to comply with the 'additionality' principle for renewable electricity generation. The exemption allows projects to use previously subsidised renewable electricity capacity, which comprises a large share of the capital investment for a renewable hydrogen project. This additional cost will be relevant for future projects (though second-round winners are also likely to be exempt).

Renewable pressures for the map of industrial geography

The most competitive bids were clustered in the northernmost and southernmost regions of the EU, where renewable electricity is the cheapest. This supports the 'renewable pull' hypothesis for energy-intensive manufacturing industries, for which theoretical evidence is provided by Verpoort et al (2024).

The disbursement of EU support for clean technologies is geo-agnostic and driven by techno-economic analysis to identify the most competitive projects. That is the case both for the EHB and the broader Innovation Fund, which supports green tech. If competitiveness is increasingly determined by a 'renewable pull', difficulties will arise in reconciling European economic efficiency with national political interest.

An innovative feature of the EHB is its offer for 'auctions-as-a-service'. Participating countries can contribute domestic funds to the wider European auction, which are then used to support their most competitive domestic bids that did not clear under the European-wide budget threshold. This financial support benefits from special treatment under state aid procedures (European Commission, 2024).

The EHB auctions-as-a-service mechanism means countries can use national subsidies to protect or grow domestic hydrogen production. Germany is the sole country to have used this feature so far, contributing €350 million through auctions-as-a-service to support 0.09 GW of domestic projects in the first round. The same €350 million distributed to the most efficient European project would have supported approximately 0.7 GW or around eight times more capacity. Austria is reportedly also poised to contribute €400 million to clear domestic projects at a similar bid price to Germany.

A tension may emerge between regions with natural competitiveness for renewably fuelled energy-intensive sectors and fiscally powerful countries with existing competitiveness in fossil-fuelled energy-intensive sectors. Striking the correct balance between exploiting areas of renewable abundance while managing existing areas of industrial agglomeration, across the European Union, will be essential. Nevertheless, the results of the first EHB auction were as positive as could have been hoped for the EU's clean hydrogen goals.

More on Thames Water and Ofwat has reportedly pushed back its review of the supplier's plan to hike bills.

According to the Telegraph, the date by which Ofwat will approve or block the plan has been changed from June 12 to July 11.

Such plan would see Thames Water hike bills by 45% over the coming years as it grapples with high debt and plans £19.8 billion of investment for 2025 to 2030.

Thames has appeared on the brink of collapse, with payments to bondholders being defaulted on, board members quitting and plans reportedly being drawn up to unload £500 million worth of loans onto the market most recently... Read more

1.43pm: Retailers climb despite poor April sales

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO), Kingfisher PLC (LSE:KGF) and Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LSE:MKS) were among the FTSE 100's top risers into Friday afternoon.

Up 1.7%, 1.2% and 0.9%, gains came despite worse-than-expected retail sales data for April earlier in the day.

Analysts subsequently noted sales should tick up in the coming months as the likes of lower inflation and growing wages help to deepen consumer pockets.

Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES) topped the day's losers, down 2.5%, while Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY), St James's Place PLC and Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) also fell.

""European equity markets are on track for their worst weekly performance in three weeks, as risk sentiment sours and interest rate bets get pushed back once again,"" XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks said.

""Stronger than expected CPI in the UK, an increase in negotiated wage growth in the first quarter for the Eurozone, hawkish Fed minutes in the US and strong PMI data have all contributed to a 'risk off' tone to markets, even though Nvidia's monster results suggest that the AI boom still has much further to go.""

1.14pm: Wall Street to open higher

Futures contracts are pointing to a bullish start to Friday for the US markets, with the Nasdaq 100 tipped to open 54 points above yesterday's close.

The broader S&P 500 index is set to open 15 points higher at 5,283.

Following yesterday's blockbuster earnings report, chipmaker Nvidia Corp is expected to add another percentage point after rally to an all-time high yesterday.

Things are quieter on the company news front today, with attention turning to durable goods orders and consumer sentiment on the macroeconomic calendar.

12.57pm: Thames Water lender seeking to offload £500mln

A lender to crisis-struck utilities provider Thames Water is seeking to offload £500 million worth of loans onto the market, according to a Bloomberg report citing ""people with knowledge of the matter"".

The lender is also hoping to offload £100 million in bonds, according to the report.

Amid financial stress and a walloping £16 billion debt pile, Thames Water's bonds have plummeted to just 5.8p on the pound.

Though this presents a steal for potential buyers who may be more optimistic about Thames Water's prospects than market pricings suggest, the company's troubles are manifold.

Parent company Kemble's debt was heavily discounted after defaulting on £400 million of bonds in April, with recent turmoil among the board of directors adding to the woes.

Thames Water's largest shareholder Omers Infrastructure withdrew its board representative last week, with more board members subsequently quitting this week.

Omers fully wrote down its 31.7% stake in Kemble, calling the utility ""worthless"" and ""uninvestable"".

12.25pm: Bitcoin, Ethereum down despite landmark ETF approval

Bitcoin (BTC) fell for the fourth day in a row on Friday, wiping out the majority of the gains penned on Monday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency closed 1.7% on Thursday, with the BTC/USD pair dipping another 0.8% this morning.

Attention has firmly shifted to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, following spot-ether approvals in the US.

Speaking on the development, ETC Group suggested that the regulatory nod, which effectively brings ether to the mainstream stock market, will result in approximately $1.65 billion of ""potential"" net inflows in the first three months of trading.

""The approval marks a significant shift in sentiment within the SEC and among US regulators in general but US investors still received inferior investment vehicles compared to European vehicles,"" said ETC Group.

It may take a few months for the ETF products to officially launch, ETC Group suggested. Once they do, ETC Group suggested a potential 92% increase on the ETH/USD pair.

At the time of writing, ETH/USD was swapping for $3,706, over 22% higher week on week.

Interestingly, the pair dipped 2% following the SEC's approval, suggesting the event was already priced in.

12.03pm: Things can only get better (apart from standing charges)

D:Ream's early-90s hit found itself a new lease on life after drowning out Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's damp election announcement on Thursday, but things are getting better for personal finances too.

That's according to interactive investor's senior personal finance expert Myron Jobson, who said that Ofgem's decision to drop the energy price cap ""adds to a growing sense that things are getting better for personal finances"".

There are caveats though.

""The harsh reality is many aren't feeling it,"" stated Jobson. ""The substantial jump in the cost of renting and high mortgage rates have come at a high cost in pounds and pence terms. The savings from the fall in the energy price cap won't touch the sides of what's needed to offset the heightened housing cost burden for many households.

""Energy bills have thankfully come down after reaching record highs in 2022. However, households are still set to pay 44% more, or £484 on average, than they did three years ago in summer 2021, before the energy price shock caused mainly by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Jobson highlighted standing charges as a ""thorny issue"" affecting energy consumers. ""They are applied to gas and electricity bills regardless of whether customers have used any energy, which makes it harder for people to save money by using less energy.""

11.38am: Nvidia price cuts

Briefly looking stateside, Nvidia Corp has reduced prices on some of its high-end AI chips in China by up to 20%, according to an exclusive report by Reuters.

This move is seen as a strategic effort to remain competitive against Huawei, a major Chinese tech company.

The price cut specifically affects the A800 chip, which Nvidia developed as an alternative to the A100 chip.

Nvidia began shipping the A800 chip to mainland China after the Biden administration's export ban on the cutting-edge A100 chip.

US tech sanctions against China aim to curb the Communist Party's development of military-grade AI technology, but they are also causing challenges for Nvidia.

During the company's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, senior Nvidia executives cautioned about ""substantially"" lower sales in China due to the export restrictions.

""Our data center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October,"" said Colette Kress, chief financial officer. ""We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.""

Despite these challenges in China, Nvidia surpassed analysts' expectations with a significant earnings beat, boosting the chipmaking giant's valuation by hundreds of billions of dollars.

11.16am: St James's Place FTSE 100's biggest loser after Hargreaves bid-fuelled rally

St James's Place PLC emerged as the FTSE 100's biggest loser on Friday, falling 3.1% after having climbed on news of a bid for rival Hargreaves Lansdown.

Hargreaves itself was down 5% on Friday, after spiking on news of the rejected £4.7 billion bid by CVC Capital Partners, Nordic Capital and a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

The consortium subsequently said another ""possible offer"" was being considered, adding a ""further announcement will be made as and when appropriate"".

HL's second-largest individual shareholder Stephen Lansdown said the bid had ""woken the stock up"" in the meantime.

HL had jumped 14% on Thursday, while peer St James's Place gained 5%.

""It's interesting to see that third parties are now seeing the value in Hargreaves Lansdown and looking to take advantage of it,"" he added.

The FTSE 100 ticked down 28 points to 8,310, as Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES), Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY) and Experian (LSE:EXPN) PLC were among others to also fall.

11.01am: Oil slips as OPEC delays meeting

Oil prices dropped on Friday on news major oil-producing nations, or OPEC+, had pushed back their latest meeting to discuss supply cuts.

Benchmark Brent Crude fell 2% to US$80.74 a barrel, having peaked above US$90 in early April.

Having committed to cuts of around 2.2 million barrels daily collectively this year, OPEC+ delayed the date of its next meeting by a day to June 2.

This comes against the backdrop of increasing output from the United States, alongside fears over demand due to high interest rates globally.

10.33am: Consumer confidence grows in May

Consumer confidence indicators have improved this month, driven by a better outlook for personal finances, GfK has reported.

The Consumer Confidence Index climbed by two points in May to minus-17, the firm said on Friday.

This was as forecasts for personal finances over the coming year rose strongly by five points to positive seven.

""With the latest drop in headline inflation and the prospect of interest rate cuts in due course, the trend is certainly positive,"" GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said.

""All in all, consumers are clearly sensing that conditions are improving.""

He did highlight a reduction in GfK's major purchase measure, however, highlighting reduced confidence over buying big-ticket items.

""With costs still heightened and some people still having to adjust to higher mortgage costs, the challenge for consumer spending is whether any future lowering of costs ends up being saved rather than spent,"" KPMG's Linda Ellet added.

10.00am: Gas up 12% over week on supply fears

Natural gas prices have jumped 12% over the course of the last week as concern built over supply.

By Friday morning, UK gas prices had increased from 74.36p per British thermal unit to 83.29p over the week.

This follows an unplanned outage at a major Norwegian plant, with the country key in supplying the rest of Europe.

Flows from Russia to Austria, which still largely relies on Moscow's gas, have also been placed in doubt over a reported foreign court ruling banning payments to Gazprom.

9.42am: Mondi gains on €500 million Eurobond launch

Mondi PLC (LSE:MNDI) enjoyed a bright start to Friday after yesterday's announcement that it had launched a €500 million Eurobond.

The bonds include a 3.75% interest rate and are set to mature in 2032.

An application will be made for the securities to be listed on the London Stock Exchange's regulated market, according to the company.

Shares climbed 2.1% to 1,607.50p on the news, placing Mondi among the FTSE 100's biggest daily risers.

The index overall fell 34 points to 8,305 in the meantime.

9.18am: UK economic growth to cool this quarter - analyst

UK gross domestic product (GDP) growth will likely cool between April and June against the first quarter, EY analysts say.

After retail sales data came in worse than expected on Friday, EY said GDP growth would be better than April in May but not be as strong over the second quarter, after the UK exited recession earlier this year.

""It's clear that the retail sector is still struggling to generate much momentum,"" EY economist Peter Arnold said.

Sales over the course of April fell 2.3% month-on-month, against a 0.2% decline in March and worse than expectations for a 0.4% drop.

Highlighting softer composite Purchasing Managers' Index data on Thursday, Arnold added: ""It suggests that the UK is likely to see a weaker outturn for GDP growth in Q2, after Q1's very strong performance.""

8.53am: The morning so far

The FTSE 100 index fell as much as 70 points in opening exchanges. Despite a slight recovery, the blue-chip index remained 47 points lower at 8,292 after the first hour of trades.

Retail sales data for April severely undershot forecasts, falling 2.3% month on month.

It follows a 0.2% fall in March and is much worse than the forecasted 0.4% drop, with sales volumes declining across most sectors.

On the company news front, GSK won a high-stake personal injury case in the state of Illinois, US, over its heartburn medication Zantac.

A jury determined that Zantac was not responsible for the plaintiff's colon cancer, with the judge rejecting a request for $640 million in damages. Shares added 0.2%

National Grid was the biggest faller of the morning following yesterday's heavily discounted rights issue.

Speaking of energy, regulator Ofgem has confirmed bills will fall by 7% in July, or £122 on an annualised basis.

The energy price cap will be set at £1,568 for direct debit customers from July to the end of September, down from £1,690 currently, Ofgem said on Friday.

Intertek was among the top risers after the assurance, testing, inspection and certification (ATIC) services provider Intertek provided an upbeat trading update.

The company reported like-for-like (LFL) revenue growth of 7% at constant currency for the first four months of 2024. Shares added 2.1%.

Divisional growth was strong, with Consumer Products growing by 6.2%, Corporate Assurance by 7.6%, Health and Safety by 9.9%, Industry and Infrastructure by 4.2%, and World of Energy by 9.4%.

""We fundamentally like these 'ATIC' activities... being a necessary and growing element within the global economy, underpinning quality companies' operations,"" said Shore Cap.

Shares added 2.85%.

7.59am: Energy bills to fall by £122

Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed bills will fall by 7% in July, or £122 on an annualised basis.

The energy price cap will be set at £1,568 for direct debit customers from July to the end of September, down from £1,690 currently, Ofgem said on Friday.

This determines how much suppliers can charge per unit of electricity or gas, with these set to cost 22.36p and 5.48p per kilowatt-hour respectively.

Prepayment meter customers will see the cap reduced to £1,522, while it will be set at £1,668 for those on standard credit deals.

""Another fall in the price cap is good news for customers who were facing bills that were hundreds of pounds higher this time last year,"" Energy UK deputy chief executive Dhara Vya commented.

Ofgem's cap had sat at £2,074 last July, on the back of higher energy prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Sales at non-food stores were down 4.1%, including clothing retailers, sports equipment, games and toys stores, and furniture stores.

Retailers reported poor weather and low footfall as the main reasons for the decline.

Additionally, automotive fuel sales showed their largest monthly fall since October 2021.

Food store sales volumes fell for the third consecutive month, mainly due to supermarkets.

7.33am: GSK wins Zantac trial

British pharmaceuticals big cap GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK) has won a high-stake personal injury case in the state of Illinois, US, over its heartburn medication Zantac.

A jury determined that Zantac was not responsible for the plaintiff's colon cancer, with the judge rejecting a request for $640 million in damages.

""This outcome is consistent with the scientific consensus that there is no consistent or reliable evidence that ranitidine increases the risk of any cancer, supported by 16 epidemiological studies looking at human data regarding the use of ranitidine,"" GSK said in a statement.

""GSK will continue to vigorously defend itself against all other claims,"" said the company.

Angela Valadez, an 89-year-old Illinois resident, claimed that prolonged use of Zantac (ranitidine) caused her to develop colorectal cancer.

The trial was one of the first to go to court among tens of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against Zantac manufacturers, including GSK and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Italian officials privately met with the executives behind the so-called Medlink project, in a sign that Rome would be willing to throw its political weight behind the plan, people familiar with the matter said.

The project calls for setting up installations including solar panels in Tunisia and Algeria, with the energy produced then exported to the Italian regions of Tuscany and Liguria via subsea lines, according to a confidential project document viewed by Bloomberg News.

The proposal was drawn up by Zhero, a company launched by former executives at gas network operator Snam SpA that recently completed financing of over €100 million ($108 million) for its start-up phase.

Zhero will need to reach about €5 billion to put the plan into action, the people said, asking not to be named discussing confidential deliberations. This poses a financing challenge to the feasibility of the project as, according to the document, development costs will have be covered by customers who book and buy electricity.

Medlink has some support at European level, having been included in the Entso-e long-term plan for the bloc's power transmission operators, and it's been integrated into Meloni's broader program for Africa that Rome says will foster growth and reduce migrant arrivals by sea.

Energy generated for Medlink could eventually account for 8% of Italy's annual electricity consumption, according to the document, which also says that providing significant new volumes of supply to the continent could make the country an ""energy hub for Europe.""

That would fit well with Meloni's plan for the region, which she has personally visited at least three times since taking office in 2022. The initative, dubbed the Mattei plan, is aimed at fostering development in the region and reducing migrant arrivals by sea.

Meloni's government has already authorized another subsea cable project linking Tunisia and southern Italy. That project, known as Elmed, will be led by state-controlled power grid operator Terna SpA and Société Tunisienne de l'Electricité et du Gaz, according to a May 15 statement.

The new link could give the premier a tangible chance to showcase her commitment to the region and to energy security to European allies as she pushes to elevate Italy's standing internationally, people familiar with the matter said.

The Tunisia and Algeria-based windmills, solar panels and battery storage sites under Medlink could account for a total of 10 GW installed capacity to deliver up to 28 TW per year of energy to northern Italy via two high-voltage offshore cables, according to the document.

The project, which is scheduled to start operations in 2030, would also aim to export power to Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

For industry (like ammonia producers), 42.5 percent of the hydrogen supply must be renewable by 2030. Renewable hydrogen products should constitute at least 1 percent of fuel supplied to the transport sector by 2030. We calculate that these obligations amount to roughly 4Mt of clean hydrogen demand, based on current fuel demand in these sectors. Figure 1 illustrates that the EHB alone is insufficient for reaching those targets.

Large private companies' willingness to pay for renewable hydrogen

The cost of producing renewable hydrogen in Europe exceeds that of fossil (natural gas-based) hydrogen by between €4 and €6 per kilogramme. The EHB set a first-round subsidy ceiling price of €4.50/kg, roughly equivalent to the green premium needed for the most competitive projects. However, the winning bids were less than 10 percent of this, at an average of €0.40/kg, meaning that the remaining 90 percent of the green premium is being covered by the end consumer and some other supply-side support we will discuss later. We can infer from these results that some European buyers are willing to pay a substantial premium for renewable hydrogen over fossil hydrogen (the blue box in Figure 2 is tall relative to the overall cost indicated in green).

This is good news for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that renewable hydrogen does not need to reach price parity with fossil hydrogen (or even close) to begin displacing meaningful volumes of the fossil incumbent. Second, the burden of narrowing that cost gap does not need to be carried solely by public funds.

Figure 2: Logic of the renewable hydrogen premium and public subsidy

For context, the winning bid prices in the EHB auction were a fraction of the roughly €11/kg subsidy for winning bids in the UK's latest renewable hydrogen auction round, and well below the United States tax credit of $3/kg, which was created under the Inflation Reduction Act. This preliminary information suggests that the EU is getting very good value from its limited funds. The use of a competitive auction design helps, with projects receiving what they 'need' rather than what they 'want'. Regulations that require existing fossil hydrogen consumers to switch to renewable hydrogen (ie the RED) also help.

Two caveats apply here. First, European projects receive further non-Hydrogen Bank financial support. From 2025, renewable hydrogen producers will be considered like their fossil counterparts in the EU emissions trading system (ETS). Consequently, they will receive a share of free carbon allowances. Fossil hydrogen producers must use the allowances to compensate for their carbon emissions, but for renewable producers with no emissions to declare, these allowances can be sold for profit. The action is intended to create a level playing field whilst allowing the carbon price to function. We calculate that these could be worth roughly €0.7/kg based on recent ETS prices, although the number of free credits allocated will already begin to be phased down from 2026.

Second, the winning bids from this first auction round should be operational by 2028 and therefore exempt for 10 years from the obligation to comply with the 'additionality' principle for renewable electricity generation . The exemption allows projects to use previously subsidised renewable electricity capacity, which comprises a large share of the capital investment for a renewable hydrogen project. This additional cost will be relevant for future projects (though second-round winners are also likely to be exempt).

Renewable pressures for the map of industrial geography

The most competitive bids were clustered in the northernmost and southernmost regions of the EU (illustrated by darker green shading in Figure 3), where renewable electricity is the cheapest. This supports the 'renewable pull' hypothesis for energy-intensive manufacturing industries, for which theoretical evidence is provided by Verpoort et al (2024).

Figure 3: Average cost of hydrogen (€/kg) implied from Hydrogen Bank bids

The disbursement of EU support for clean technologies is geo-agnostic and driven by techno-economic analysis to identify the most competitive projects. That is the case both for the EHB and the broader Innovation Fund, which supports green tech . If competitiveness is increasingly determined by a 'renewable pull', difficulties will arise in reconciling European economic efficiency with national political interest.

An innovative feature of the EHB is its offer for 'auctions-as-a-service'. Participating countries can contribute domestic funds to the wider European auction, which are then used to support their most competitive domestic bids that did not clear under the European-wide budget threshold. This financial support benefits from special treatment under state aid procedures (European Commission, 2024).

The EHB auctions-as-a-service mechanism means countries can use national subsidies to protect or grow domestic hydrogen production. Germany is the sole country to have used this feature so far, contributing €350 million through auctions-as-a-service to support 0.09 GW of domestic projects in the first round. The same €350 million distributed to the most efficient European project would have supported approximately 0.7 GW or around eight times more capacity. Austria is reportedly also poised to contribute €400 million to clear domestic projects at a similar bid price to Germany.

A tension may emerge between regions with natural competitiveness for renewably fuelled energy-intensive sectors and fiscally powerful countries with existing competitiveness in fossil-fuelled energy-intensive sectors. Striking the correct balance between exploiting areas of renewable abundance while managing existing areas of industrial agglomeration, across the European Union, will be essential. Nevertheless, the results of the first EHB auction were as positive as could have been hoped for the EU's clean hydrogen goals.

Zelenskiy said the need for improved air defense systems was discussed at a special meeting on Ukrainian arms production and countermeasures against Russian guided aerial bombs.

""This is a challenging topic, and while we see some good progress on electronic warfare, drones, and the missile program, there is still a lot of work to be done to counter Russian bombs,"" he said in a summary posted at his website.

He said Ukraine needs systems and tactics that will allow it to protect its troop positions and cities and other communities from the bombs, which he said are the ""main instrument of Russian terror and the advance of the occupier.""

Zelenskiy's comments came after a Russian air attack on Kharkiv injured at least nine people and set fire to a residential building, local officials said.

""One of the guided aerial bombs, according to preliminary data, hit a cafe. It is very close to a multistory residential building,"" Serhiy Bolvinov, the head of the investigative department of the regional police, told Ukrainian television.

Zelenskiy said earlier this month that Russia used more than 3,200 guided bombs against Ukrainian targets in April. Russia has increasingly resorted to these bombs, which are directed to a target by a guidance system, have great destructive potential, and pose fewer risks to air crews delivering them.

Commenting on the situation at the front, Zelenskiy said border issues are receiving maximum attention not only in the Kharkiv region but also in the Sumy region.

The areas of the main battles have not changed and remain primarily Pokrovsk and other areas in the Donetsk region and in the area around Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region.

The Ukrainian Air Force said earlier on May 22 that its air defenses shot down all 24 drones launched by Russia at targets on Ukraine's territory early in the say.

""The drones were destroyed over the Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, Donetsk, Sumy, and Odesa regions,"" the air force command said in a statement.

Separately, the Sumy city council said power lines and water pipes were damaged by falling drone debris and that the power supply to the city was disrupted. It said work was already under way to restore water and electricity to the city's inhabitants.

Zelenskiy also announced in his address that four more countries -- Albania, Austria, Chile, and Mozambique -- had agreed to attend a peace summit in Switzerland in June. The aim of the meeting is to create a broad front to oblige Russia to agree to a peace settlement under the terms of the UN Charter.

""Russian aggression has tried to turn the UN Charter into a museum exhibit,"" Zelenskiy said. ""Our peace summit...can restore the full effectiveness and full protection of the UN Charter to every nation.""

Zelenskiy's peace plan calls for the withdrawal of all Russian forces and the restoration of Ukraine's 1991 borders.

Russia, which rejects the plan, has not been invited to the summit and has dismissed any discussion of the conflict without its participation as pointless.

Labour and the Conservatives will go head-to-head on a range of divisive issues over the next six weeks as the general election campaign gets underway.

A rain-sodden Rishi Sunak announced the date of the vote as July 4 in a surprise address from Downing Street this afternoon.

'Now is the moment for Britain to decide its future,' the Prime Minister told voters.

The state of the economy, immigration - including migrant deportation flights to Rwanda - and the NHS are all set to be key issues during the election campaign.

But there will also be fights over other topics such as defence spending, the environment, and Britain's attitude to the war in Gaza.

It is expected to be a dirty fight with Mr Sunak having already made clear he will paint Labour's Sir Keir Starmer as a danger to the economy and national security.

The economy

Taxes, economic growth and the cost-of-living crisis are expected to be at the front and centre of the general election battle between the two main parties.

The country has been through a massive period of turmoil since Boris Johnson won the last general election in December 2019: Brexit, Covid and then the shocks of the short-lived Liz Truss premiership.

But Mr Sunak's decision to go to the polls in July is based largely on the idea that the economy has bounced back and that voters can now trust the Conservatives more than they can Labour.

Rumours of an impending general election announcement gathered pace after Mr Sunak hailed a 'major milestone' with inflation tumbling to the lowest level in nearly three years.

In latest figures announced this morning, the headline CPI rate slid from 3.2 per cent in March to 2.3 per cent last month - near the Bank of England's 2 per cent target.

The PM said the figures showed that his plan is working and 'brighter days are ahead' - a slogan the likes of which we can expect to hear a lot in the coming weeks.

The UK has had the lowest annual inflation rate for electricity, gas and other fuels on record

The Tories will try to paint Labour as still akin to the party it was when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, a danger to people's livelihoods and homes.

This however will be a tricky ask, given what has happened in the past two years.

Mortgage rates are still high by recent standards and despite the fall in inflation it is not expected they will fall before the election happens.

And Labour under Sir Keir has been at pains to distance itself from the Corbyn years. Mr Corbyn has been kicked out of the party and his allies sidelines as it seeks to win over businesses as well as voters.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves this morning said she was 'much more ambitious for the country than Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt seem to be'.

Speaking to reporters, the shadow chancellor said Labour would focus on 'bringing stability back to our economy' including through 'our plan to invest in home-grown renewables so we're less reliant on Putin and dictators around the world for our basic energy needs and can bring energy bills down for families and pensioners'.

Additionally taxes are currently at a 70-year high, and polls suggest voters now associate the Tories as much with high rates as Labour.

'After 14 years of Conservative chaos families are worse off. Prices in the shops have soared, mortgage bills have risen and taxes are at a 70-year high,' Ms Reeves said.

'Rishi Sunak is now putting family finances at risk again with his £46 billion unfunded policy to abolish national insurance that will mean higher borrowing, higher taxes or the end of the state pension as we know it.

'It's time for change. Labour's first steps will deliver economic stability so we can grow our economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.'

Immigration

Mr Sunak will be hoping he can get the first Rwanda migrant deportation flight off the ground before the general election.

The first aircraft is due to head to east Africa at the start of July, in a move that Mr Sunak hopes will end Channel small boat crossings and improve Tory election chances.

But the PM still faces the thorny issue of legal migration, which Mr Sunak himself has acknowledged is 'too high'.

The latest net migration estimates could become the first focus of debate among voters when they are published tomorrow.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) will publish the figures on Thursday, at the same time as the Home Office releases its quarterly immigration statistics containing a host of detail on visas, the asylum system and Channel crossings.

The Government has brought in a raft of restrictions since the start of the year amid pressure to cut the record number of people legally arriving in Britain.

Earlier on Wednesday, before the election was announced, Home Secretary James Cleverly declared the Conservatives' plan to cut legal migration levels was working, as his department's figures indicated a fall in the number of overseas student and foreign care worker visa applications.

This was despite the data also signalling a jump in the number of work visa applications.

Thursday's ONS net migration figures, to December 2023, will provide a comparison with the previous 12 months and cover a period preceding the introduction of the Government's reforms so they are unlikely to show a significant reduction.

The Home Office stressed the ONS figures 'do not take into account the major package measures announced in December which have already started to have an effect'.

Mr Sunak will be hoping he can get the first Rwanda migrant deportation flight off the ground before the general election in a move the PM hopes will end Channel small boat crossings

Fresh migration statistics to be published on Thursday are expected to show the number of people coming to Britain remains high

The NHS

The NHS consistently ranks as the second most important issue for voters and, again, it is a policy area in which the Conservatives have work to do to improve public perceptions of their performance.

Historically high waiting lists for treatment, ageing infrastructure across the NHS estate and workforce challenges combine to paint a picture of the much-loved health service on its knees.

The Government has made progress in reducing waiting times since the Covid pandemic, but the scale of the problem means the figures remain at a level many voters will be disturbed by.

Meanwhile, Labour has promised to cut waiting times and increase appointments and operations.

However, the scale of the issues in the NHS, the complexities across the system and wider related services, as well as the scale of funding involved, pose a huge challenge for whichever party wins power.

Workers' rights

The Tories have warned Labour are planning to bring in 'new French-style laws' as Sir Keir's party plots an overhaul of workers' rights if they win power.

Labour chiefs and trade union bosses last week reached agreement over the party's proposed 'New Deal for Working People' after spending hours locked in showdown discussions.

The meeting came after weeks of tensions between Sir Keir and those unions who bankroll Labour over claims the planned employment reforms were being weakened.

There had been fears among unions that Labour was bowing to pressure from businesses to water down the plans ahead of the general election.

Business chiefs have swiped at the proposals - spearheaded by deputy leader Angela Rayner - by warning against excessive regulation that might harm productivity.

Under Ms Rayner's plans to strengthen workers' rights, a Labour government would ban zero-hour contracts and end 'fire and rehire' practices.

There are also proposals to entitle employees to sick pay and parental leave from day one, introduce a 'right to switch off' after leaving the office, and boost workers' rights to flexible working.

And Labour wants to empower adult social care professionals and trade unions that represent them to negotiate a sector-wide agreement for pay, terms and conditions.

Tory ministers have swiped that Sir Keir has 'surrendered' to Ms Rayner and trade unions by backing the plans.

Business minister Kevin Hollinrake said earlier this month: 'Their new French-style laws will ban flexible working, make it harder for small businesses to hire new staff and make it much easier to strike.

'That's why businesses are warning this risks costing jobs and damaging the economy.'

Under Angela Rayner's plans to strengthen workers' rights, a Labour government would ban zero-hour contracts and end 'fire and rehire' practices

Gaza

The Middle East conflict has prompted serious divisions within Labour, which the Tories could seek to exploit during the general election campaign.

Sir Keir has come under intense pressure from Labour activists, local councillors and a large number of his MPs to shift his stance ever since the Hamas terror attacks on 7 October.

The Labour leader has repeatedly defended Israel's right to self defence in the wake of those attacks as he kept his party close to the Government's position on the crisis.

But a dividing line has recently opened up between the two parties after Labour appeared to back the International Criminal Court's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.

The ICC's chief prosecutor Karim Khan triggered international outrage after saying he would apply for arrest warrants for key Israeli and Hamas figures who he said were responsible for war crimes in Gaza and Israel.

They include Mr Netanyahu, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant as well as Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh.

He accused Israel of using 'starvation as a method of warfare' and carrying out 'collective punishment' of the population of Gaza and said Hamas's actions were 'unconscionable crimes' that 'demand accountability'.

But Labour shadow foreign secretary David Lammy defended the court and said that 'international law must be upheld'.

Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters are pictured confronting each other in central London, exchanging boos and opposing chants

This prompted David Cameron to brand Labour the 'odd man out' as he noted how Germany, the US, Italy, Austria and the Czech Republic had all fiercely condemned the action by the ICC's chief prosecutor.

The Foreign Secretary compared this to how Labour 'seems to be saying it supports the ICC in every way' as he labelled the decision by The Hague-based court 'a mistake'.

He also hit out at the ICC for drawing 'moral equivalence' between Mr Netanyahu and Hamas terrorists, in an echo of Mr Sunak's own criticism of the 'deeply unhelpful' move.

But Labour sources denied that Mr Lammy had drawn any moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas.

They said he was in agreement with other countries including France, Germany and the EU in backing the independence of the ICC.

Lord Cameron said the seeking of arrest warrants was not going to help 'get the hostages out, it's not going to help get aid in and it's not going to help deliver a sustainable ceasefire'.

'As we have said from the outset, because Israel is not a signatory to the Rome Statute and because Palestine is not yet recognised as a state we don't think that the court has jurisdiction in this area,' he added.",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,-0.0980392156862745,454103119,1,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/22/19/85216889-0-image-m-26_1716404042354.jpg,eng-9589547

""As a neutral country, Austria also must stand on the side of humanity in this war,"" emphasized Minister Gewessler in her statement. The funds provided were intended to make a significant contribution to ""at least somewhat simplify"" the reconstruction of Ukraine's energy infrastructure. This humanitarian support is a sign of solidarity and humanity, she added.

Gratitude and solidarity

The Ukrainian ambassador to Austria, Vasyl Khymynets, expressed his deep gratitude for the support and called the financial aid a ""strong signal of solidarity"", as reported by ORF. Against the backdrop of the ongoing Russian efforts to destroy the energy infrastructure in Ukraine through targeted air strikes and artillery fire, this aid is of utmost importance, he said. ""This financial aid from the German government is extremely important to restore objects of the energy infrastructure and supply the people of Ukraine with electricity,"" explained Khymynets.

Objectives and use of funds

The five million euros come from the budget of the Ministry of Climate Protection and will be distributed in Ukraine via the Energy Community. This organization will use the funds to procure urgently needed spare parts, and generators and to repair lines. The aim is to restore the energy supply in the affected regions as quickly as possible and thus improve the living conditions of local people.

""In light of the severe damage to Ukraine's energy infrastructure, any support is invaluable,"" said Khymynets, as reported by ORF. ""Restoring this infrastructure is crucial to providing the population with vital electricity and stabilizing the country's economy.""

Austria's contribution to humanitarian aid

Austria is thus making an important contribution to international humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The provision of funds for the reconstruction of the energy infrastructure demonstrates the country's commitment to mitigating the humanitarian impact of the war and strengthening the resilience of the affected regions. This financial aid is a further step in the ongoing efforts to support Ukraine in its difficult situation.

""Our support goes beyond financial aid. We are in close contact with our Ukrainian partners and the international community to ensure that our aid gets to where it is most urgently needed,"" emphasized Gewessler. ""It is our duty and responsibility to act in solidarity in times of need.""

Long-term perspectives

The funds provided are part of a broader plan aimed at long-term support and cooperation. Austria plans to take further measures to support Ukraine in the future and to work closely with international partners. ""Our goal is to find sustainable solutions that will help Ukraine to rebuild its infrastructure and strengthen its independence,"" said Gewessler.

With this decision, the Austrian Federal Government is sending a clear signal of solidarity and responsibility at a time when international support is crucial. The aid payments of five million euros are an important step on the way to stabilizing and rebuilding Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which has been severely affected by the ongoing war.",vindobona.org,news,Vindobona.org | Vienna International News,,0.2784313725490195,454100912,10,https://www.vindobona.org/images/text/leonore-gewessler-on-the-current-situation-of-gas-storage-facilities.jpg,

Today, it's far from its modest beginnings, sprawling in scale and catering to a considerably different crowd, but you'll still find heaps of heritage everywhere in this forward-thinking property that treasures traditional Tyrolean hospitality.

Surrounded by the Alpine slopes of Kitzbühel, you'll find more skiers than miners frequenting Stanglwirt now. The 5-star property is a bio and wellness resort today, operating a green spa and maintaining a nearly 250-acre organic farm that supports its culinary program. The commitment to sustainability runs deep, from macro efforts like generating all of its heat from its own biomass plant and using only carbon pollution-free, hydro-powered electricity to the smallest details like using lime mortar instead of cement between timber bricks. But nowhere does sustainability come at the sacrifice of luxury.

Checking in, you'll immediately notice the abundance of natural wood, from floors and ceilings to every piece of furniture. Eschewing the use of unsustainable construction materials, the abundance of solid wood also evokes Stanglwirt's considerable history.

The 171 rooms are outfitted with sheep wool rugs, while all linens, towels and upholstery are of pure cotton and linen. Even the mattresses are naturally filled with horsehair and sheep's wool. The spa-style bathrooms are equipped with water-saving shower heads, and all of Stanglwirt's water comes from its own spring.

In the morning, you may wake to horses grazing in the lawn beyond your balcony, or spot Stanglwirt's sheep enjoying green roofs below the towering mountains. In summer, you can take guided evening walks into the hills to visit the property's cattle in their mountainside pasture; year-round, you can dine with them at Gasthof Stanglwirt, enjoying regional favorites in this white-cloth restaurant as cows enjoy their own dinner from the neighboring barn, separated by tableside windows. For more interactive animal experiences, consider riding lessons at the resort's elite Lipizzaner riding school, home to two dozen of these rare and royal horses, or take one for a trail ride.

Whether returning from hiking, biking or skiing, Stanglwirt's Green Spa Resort is the star of the property, with more than 16,000 square feet of indulgent treatment space surrounded by sauna and water complexes that include Europe's largest saltwater pool, a rock crystal steam bath, a waterfall grotto and an additional 10,000-square-foot children's water world. From relaxing on submerged bubble jet recliners with mountain views to guided sessions in the event sauna, it's the ultimate oasis for relaxation and rejuvenation -- from the day, from life or from training.

Stanglwirt is a haven for European athletes and serves as a training base for professionals of several disciplines. Home to Europe's No. 1 tennis school, the tennis village here includes six indoor courts and eight outdoor courts. The property is also home to its own golf school and driving range. If you're looking for some physical fitness with less of a time commitment, free yoga, Pilates and workout classes are regularly available in the handsomely equipped indoor fitness center.

Still, a visit here is a getaway for most, and, while Stanglwirt certainly knows how to honor special occasions, each day is equally celebrated, and there's no better space to experience the natural joy and camaraderie of the property than at Auf der Tenne, the lobby bar. This soaring pine building -- a former grain and hay barn -- is home to all manner of libations, from craft cocktails with dazzling presentation to an impressive spirit list, curated wines, and, of course, beer (mocktails, and plenty of other non-alcoholic options are available, too). But it's the afterhours atmosphere of this space that best tells the story of the resort. Always crowded with visitors of all ages (even the little ones) and often enjoying live performances from the central stage late into the night, it's a gathering place for guests of all backgrounds, coming together to appreciate Stanglwirt's atmosphere of comfort and natural ease that otherwise exists only at home.",globaltravelerusa.com,news,Global Traveler,,0.2392156862745098,454096828,1,https://www.globaltravelerusa.com/wp-content/uploads/stanglwirt3.jpg,

The PTC must now decide, based on the evidence Khan submitted, whether there are ""reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court"" (Rome Statute, art. 58(1)(a)).

If so, the Court will issue warrants against Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar (Hamas's head in Gaza), Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (leader of Hamas's military wing, the al-Qassam Brigade), and Ismael Haniyeh (head of Hamas's political bureau, who resides in Qatar). The Prosecutor accuses them of eight different war crimes and crimes against humanity: murder, extermination, hostage taking, sexual violence, torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and ""other inhumane acts"" - the last six of these ""in the context of captivity"" of the hostages.

Prosecutor Khan has also requested arrest warrants against Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accused of seven war crimes and crimes against humanity. These are starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, willful killing or murder, intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population (all these are war crimes) plus extermination and/or murder, persecution, and ""other inhumane acts"" as crimes against humanity.

Nobody claims that these leaders have personally killed or tortured anyone. That doesn't matter, because anyone who ""orders, solicits, or induces"" others to commit Rome Statute crimes can be charged as a principal (art. 25(3)(b)).

What follows are some preliminary thoughts and questions - explaining some of the charges, but also asking why certain charges were not in Prosecutor Khan's request.

What I will not comment on is whether any of the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant are justified, for one simple reason: I have no idea what evidence the prosecutor has to support the accusations. Khan's public announcement asserts that his team set a threshold even stronger than reasonable belief: ""a realistic prospect of conviction."" But, lacking insider knowledge of the evidence or the facts on the ground, it would be completely irresponsible to opine on the strength of his cases - not that this is likely to stop anyone from sounding off about it. U.S. President Joe Biden and leaders in the UK, Austria, and the Czech Republic have denounced the Prosecutor's move as outrageous ""false equivalency."" That response misses the mark. An accusation that both sides have committed war crimes does not say the two sides are morally equivalent. It does not say they are politically equivalent. It does not even say they are legally equivalent. All it means, as Khan said in an interview Monday, is that ""no people anywhere are saints.""

One way they are not equivalent is that Israel can stop the ICC investigation in its tracks by launching its own investigation. Under the ICC's founding principle of complementarity, a case is ""inadmissible"" if it is being ""investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution"" (Rome Statute art. 17(1)(a)). Israel has one of the world's most sophisticated justice systems. It is clearly able to investigate the charges. Palestine, on the other hand - meaning the Palestinian Authority - is in no position to investigate and prosecute war crimes by Hamas committed in Israel and Gaza, even if it wanted to.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused the Prosecutor of ignoring complementarity by not ""allowing the Israeli legal system a full and timely opportunity to proceed. ... The prosecutor did not afford the same opportunity to Israel, which has ongoing investigations into allegations against its personnel."" This too misses the mark. It may be that Israel is investigating war crimes allegations against individual IDF fighters on the ground - but it shows no intention of investigating Netanyahu and Gallant, and these are the men the prosecutor has accused. It is not too late for Israel to exercise complementarity by investigating the accusations against its leaders.

With those cautions in mind, what do we make of the charges themselves?

The most noteworthy, and potentially confusing, counts in the request are the accusations against both sides' leaders of ""extermination"" as a crime against humanity - and the conspicuous absence of the charge of genocide.

For those unfamiliar with international criminal law, extermination and genocide may seem like two names for the same crime. Obviously, campus demonstrators and others over the past months have hurled the accusation of genocide against Israel, infuriating many Israelis and their supporters. So did an unusually intemperate report by U.N. Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, whose ""Anatomy of a Genocide"" draft report speculatively dismissed all of Israel's military justifications for the Gaza war as mere ""humanitarian camouflage"" for genocide, adding that in her opinion genocide is ""inherent to settler-colonialism"" (and, obviously, assuming without argument that Israel is a settler-colonialist state). South Africa has accused Israel of genocide, in litigation before the International Court of Justice, and it may seem as though Prosecutor Khan is now confirming that accusation by accusing Netanyahu and Gallant of extermination. That is untrue, because the two crimes are quite different.To be clear: with or without genocide, the other accusations against the Israeli leaders are exceptionally grave.

The Hamas defendants are also charged with extermination, but not with genocide. As I explain below, there is actually a strong case for calling the October 7th attack genocide against a part of the Israeli people. To see why, we need to examine the difference between the crimes.

That difference lies in the different definitions of ""crime against humanity,"" ""extermination,"" and ""genocide."" Crimes against humanity (CAH for short) are crimes committed as part of an organized attack on a civilian population; the Rome Statute names 11 CAHs, one of which is extermination. To count as ""extermination,"" a perpetrator must have killed at least one person ""as part of a mass killing"" (ICC Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(b)(2)). ""Genocide"" requires something even more sinister: an intention to destroy a national, racial, ethnic, or religious group as such ""in whole or in part."" A key difference is the presence or absence of genocidal intention - the intention to destroy the group.

Israel's rebuttal of genocide accusations has always been that it is acting in self-defense against a deadly threat in a war that it did not start and did not want; and that it aims to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people in Gaza. In fact, the Prosecutor explicitly agrees that Israel ""has a right to take action to defend its population."" (The ICJ, in its 2004 advisory opinion Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, ¶141, called it a duty.) Israel argues that the civilian casualties are unintended collateral damage (""incidental"" in the antiseptic language of international humanitarian law), inevitable because Hamas has so deeply embedded itself in the vicinity of civilians - which is itself a war crime. Israel has denied that the IDF targets civilians, and it insists that it complies with the laws of war.

Obviously, the Prosecutor disagrees that Israel has complied with the law. One notable feature of the legal definition of ""extermination"" is that it uses the term ""killed"" rather than ""murdered"" - and the Elements further explains that ""killed"" means simply ""caused death."" Thus, mass killings don't mean anything like premeditated murders, although the Prosecutor's arrest warrant request charges ""extermination and/or murder,"" indicating that he is not ruling out that some Israeli killings are murder. The expert panel advising the prosecutor explains why here, ¶¶29-31. The panelists clarify that the charge refers to ""the killing of civilians who died as a result of starvation,"" adding that ""a large number of Palestinian civilians have already died in these circumstances."" Ominously, ""The Panel's assessment is that there are reasonable grounds to believe that ... the suspects meant these deaths to happen or ... they were aware that deaths would occur in the ordinary course of events as a result of their methods of warfare.""

Crucially, the Statute explains that ""extermination"" can include ""the intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population"" - and that seems to be the heart of the accusation against Israel. It runs parallel to another accusation in the Prosecutor's statement: that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war, which is a war crime.

Extermination and deliberate starvation are horrifying charges. They can be plausibly alleged only because of the staggering number of civilian casualties, the famine unfolding in Gaza, and Israel's foot-dragging (or obstruction) regarding humanitarian aid. Khan points especially to the siege of Gaza that began on Oct.8, cutting off access to food, water, medicine, and electricity. ""This took place alongside other attacks on civilians, including those queuing for food; obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian agencies; and attacks on and killing of aid workers, which forced many agencies to cease or limit their operations in Gaza."" As early as Oct. 11, Tom Dannenbaum persuasively made the case that this obstruction looked like the war crime of starvation used as a method of warfare.

But the Prosecutor did not charge genocide, which signals that he does not have sufficient evidence of the intent to destroy the Gazans in whole or in part. And while he left the door open to potential future charges, the omission of genocide at this stage means something, because his team has been looking for evidence for months. His accusations are based on ""interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses, authenticated video, photo and audio material, satellite imagery and statements from the alleged perpetrator group"" - presumably, better evidence than we have seen in the noisy public debates and ICJ filings.

Implicitly, then - and whether he meant to or not - Prosecutor Khan has buttressed Israel's repeated insistence in the ICJ litigation that there is no plausible genocide case against Israel - in which case, as the Israeli Judge Aharon Barak argued (here, ¶¶6, 19), the ICJ has no jurisdiction over the Gaza war because South Africa's case was brought solely under the Convention Against Genocide.

Is there really insufficient evidence of genocidal intent? Both South Africa and the Special Rapporteur documented numerous statements by high-ranking Israeli public figures (including cabinet ministers) that can plausibly be interpreted as calls to genocide. (See South Africa's initial ICJ application, ¶¶101-107, and the Special Rapporteur's ""Anatomy of a Genocide"" report, ¶¶50-54.) Israel's response is that none of this populist rhetoric comes from anyone in the chain of command (see Sir Malcolm Shaw's oral argument to the ICJ, pages 31-35, §§ 36-52). The absence of a genocide charge in today's arrest warrant request strongly suggests that Prosecutor Khan agrees that flamethrowing populist rhetoric by figures outside the chain of command is not evidence of genocidal intent within the chain of command.

Those statements may not inculpate Netanyahu, Gallant, and IDF leaders - but they could support charges against right-wing political leaders for incitement to genocide. Even if these men and women aren't in the chain of command, and even if they are only haranguing their political base, we must not forget that the IDF is a citizens' army that draws from all sectors of Israeli society including their political base. If any IDF soldiers killed Gazan civilians with genocidal intent, then the leaders who incited them could be guilty of incitement to genocide (Rome Statute, art. 25(3)(e)) - which also happens to be a capital offense under Israel's own domestic law (here, §§ 2, 3(a)(2)).

Even without the genocide charge, the other accusations against Netanyahu and Gallant are terrible enough. Indeed, Prosecutor Khan comes perilously close to a genocide accusation when he writes that along with eliminating Hamas and returning the hostages, the leaders' third war aim is to ""collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza, whom they perceived as a threat to Israel."" Furthermore, his arrest warrant request accuses them of persecution as a CAH, defined in the Rome Statute as ""the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity."" In other words, he charges group-based animus and serious deprivation of fundamental rights. What is lacking for the charge of genocide is the intent to destroy, rather than ""merely"" to persecute.

What about Hamas? Could its leaders be accused of genocide? The answer is yes, and the case is clearer than the case against Israel, even though the number of deaths Hamas inflicted is far fewer. To those who think that genocide always involves mass killings, this will seem absurd - but there is no numbers requirement for crimes to qualify as genocide as a matter of law. Genocide includes the destruction of the group ""in part,"" which courts have rightly interpreted as a substantial part. But long ago the ICTY established that ""substantial"" has to do with the part's significance or prominence, not numbers alone (Prosecutor v. Krstić, Appeals Chamber Judgment ¶¶12-16).

The October 7th ""Al Aqsa Flood"" attack included multiple actus rei of genocide, most obviously the murder of over a thousand people and the infliction of serious bodily or mental harm on hundreds more, including the hostages. The significance and prominence of this group of victims could hardly be more obvious, and they probably qualify as a substantial part of the Israeli nation as a whole on the ICTY's Krstić test. The individual crimes ""took place in the context of a manifest context of similar conduct"" - a requirement in the Elements for the crime of genocide.

And there seems to be little doubt that they were carried out with the intent to destroy the national group of Israeli Jews in whole or in part. It doesn't matter that the accused leaders knew the attack could not succeed in that aim: what makes their crimes genocide is the intent to destroy the national group as such, an intent the Hamas leadership has seldom disguised. (Some leaders' statements were quoted by Israel's advocate Tal Becker in an ICJ hearing, pp. 15-16, §§ 22-24. Among these is a chilling statement by Hamas official Ghazi Hamad: ""We will repeat the October 7 attack time and again, until Israel is annihilated."")

It does not matter that the 2017 revision of Hamas's charter removed the overt antisemitism of its 1988 original. It now explains that Hamas's struggle is not against Jews because of their Jewishness (i.e., their membership in a religious or ethnic group), but against the ""Zionists who occupy Palestine"" (here, §16). The phrase can be interpreted in more than one way, but the most natural is that it refers to Israeli Jews, understood as a national group. That matters because national groups, no less than religious, racial, and ethnic groups, are protected by the Genocide Convention and the Rome Statute.

Why, then, did the prosecutor not charge genocide against the Hamas leaders? Here I can only speculate that given the enormous disparity in the number of casualties, it would have seemed bizarre and one-sided to charge Hamas with genocide without levying that charge against Israel as well.

So far, I have focused on genocide and extermination, and considered the significance of Prosecutor Khan's decision not to charge genocide. Other omissions are also significant, but hard to interpret. I will mention two.

The first is Hamas's deep embedding in and beneath civilian structures - human shielding that surely accounts for a great deal of the devastation caused by Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas. Under the Rome Statute, human shielding is a war crime: ""Utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations"" (Rome Statute, art. 8(2)(b)(xxiii)). Now it might be objected that Hamas's aim was never to make its forces immune from attack, but rather to provoke it - to delegitimize Israel by making sure that when the IDF responded to October 7th (as it inevitably would) the result would be horrifying and highly visible damage to Gazan civilians. Of course that is speculation by Hamas's enemies, and legally Hamas's expectations of what the IDF would do are irrelevant. The Elements explains that the crime is committed if the perpetrator ""took advantage of the location of one or more civilians"" intending ""to shield a military objective from attack or shield, favour or impede military operations."" At the very least, it seems clear that Hamas intended that placing military assets in civilian structures would impede Israeli military operations.

The most likely explanation of this omission is a peculiarity of this case: that the Gaza War is, in the Prosecutor's words, ""an international armed conflict between Israel and Palestine, and a non-international armed conflict between Israel and Hamas running in parallel."" In the Rome Statute, human shielding is a war crime only in international armed conflicts (IACs) - a truly unfortunate omission. As the authors of the ICRC's massive 2005 study Customary International Humanitarian Law noted about in bello rules, ""Common sense would suggest that such rules, and the limits they impose on the way war is waged, should be equally applicable in international and non-international armed conflicts"" (vol. 1, page xxix). Cabining off one of Hamas's most serious offenses against its own civilians seems artificial and legally unnecessary. If the Gaza War is indeed part of an international armed conflict with Palestine, it was surely open to the Prosecutor to apply the IAC rules to this egregious violation.

Second, and more minor (but puzzling nonetheless): Prosecutor Khan charged Israeli leaders with the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population - but did not charge the same crime against Hamas leaders. He could have, because intentional attacks on a civilian population are Rome Statute crimes in both international and non-international armed conflicts.

Two more observations, unrelated to the above:

First, the current set of accusations concerns only Gaza, not the West Bank. But the West Bank is also part of the ""Situation in Palestine"" that the Prosecutor has been investigating for several years. So we may see indictments involving the West Bank in the not-too-distant future.

Second, of historical note: as I mentioned above, Prosecutor Khan consulted with a panel of experts, whose report issued concurrently with his announcement Monday; it supports his request for arrest warrants. Among the experts is Theodor Meron, a distinguished jurist, former President of the ICTY, and - notably - a former legal adviser to Israel's Foreign Ministry at the time of the Six Days' War. At that time, he wrote a secret memorandum warning that the establishment of settlements in the newly occupied territory would violate Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. His memo came to light many years later, as Meron himself finally confirmed in a 2017 law review article (The West Bank and International Humanitarian Law on the Eve of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Six-Day War). All these decades later, Meron still believes that applying the law faithfully is in Israel's interest.",justsecurity.org,news,Just Security,,-0.4823529411764705,454094859,1,https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-597691694-e1606708064553.jpg,eng-9584015

These hostages represent over 17 nationalities, including five Americans as well as citizens from Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.

Last month, these nations released a joint statement calling for the immediate release of these hostages. But Hamas continues to stall. And given the global geopolitical context, what is Yahya Sinwar's motivation for meeting their demands?

After spending last week in Israel witnessing firsthand the devastation of Oct. 7 and the lasting effects of the ongoing hostage crisis, it is difficult to grasp how U.S. foreign policy is being conducted on this issue.

With each day that passes, the likelihood for the return of these loved ones to their families diminishes. While the vast majority of Americans stand in solidarity with the families who are suffering, the Biden administration's actions to date suggest that securing the release of American victims of Hamas is not a policy priority, which only emboldens Sinwar's position.

What can our leaders do to affect the release of these hostages? The answer is quite simple: Support Israel and pressure Hamas.

First, President Biden should acknowledge his responsibility to the American citizens who are being held hostage. They should be at the top of his policy priority list, not buried in the ninth point of a ten-point White House briefing on policy toward the Middle East, as we saw on May 13.

Second, Biden's actions must align with that priority. The hostages are Sinwar's leverage to survive Israel's justified response to a huge terrorist massacre against civilians. U.S. actions and statements that give Sinwar confidence he may survive, even without giving up hostages, guarantee that Hamas will keep holding our hostages. Why would Sinwar give up his leverage if our own president is willing to help him achieve his objective via unilateral pressure on Israel?

With American hostages as his first responsibility, Biden must unequivocally stand by Israel, not criticize, hamper, and marginalize its effort to bring home all the hostages. Most recently, the U.S. paused the shipment of over 3,500 bombs to Israel and threatened sanctions against a unit of the Israel Defense Force. Public opposition to a campaign to eliminate Hamas infrastructure in Rafah gives Sinwar all the hope he needs to hold out longer.

A clear-eyed view of why Israel is pushing into Rafah and the continuous work they have undertaken to minimize the humanitarian impact of the conflict should be articulated by the Biden Administration. Indeed, the Israeli military has expended tremendous energy coordinating the clearance of hundreds of aid trucks per day, restoring water and electricity across parts of Gaza, only to experience one letdown after another due to Sinwar's bad-faith negotiations.

The latitude for Hamas' disingenuous behavior in negotiations has been fueled by wavering support and open condemnation of Israel by its greatest ally, the United States. President Biden and his Administration have placed election politics and a poor interpretation of the extreme left flank of their party above their responsibility to American citizens. As a result, Sinwar feels emboldened. At the same time, one also must consider the role of social media apps like TikTok whose algorithm is disproportionally propagating messages of support for Palestinians and Hamas and spreading antisemitic disinformation about Israel. The propaganda arm of the CCP continues to weaken societal bonds while promoting false narratives.

Let us never forget that Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization, not a legitimate negotiating partner. A group that tortured and massacred women and children in the most brutal ways possible will never negotiate in good faith.

One viable path for Israel to free the hostages is to maximize pressure on Sinwar by going into Rafah and conducting its operation to eradicate Hamas. Tightening the noose around Sinwar and forcing him back to the negotiating table showed signs of success earlier this week.

Biden needs to look in the mirror and remember who he serves. Americans have been taken hostage by a terror organization during an unprovoked invasion of an allied nation. His job is not an easy one -- it requires courage and moral conviction and clarity, something Barack Obama has publicly asserted as a defining reason for his support of Biden.

Biden must commit himself and his administration to bringing home and returning American hostages to their families by standing by Israel instead of undermining it. The alternative is to keep playing both sides of the issue for political purposes, allowing American hostages to die in Hamas's custody.",thehill.com,news,The Hill,,0.0117647058823529,454073714,1,https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/654ae44867ba39.69604492.jpeg?strip=1&w=640,

Son of famed Georgian keeper David, young Giorgi started out at the nation's top side, Dinamo Tbilisi, but in four years didn't make a single appearance. Stuck as fourth choice he was then sent off on loan, first to Rustavi where he let in four on his debut, then to Lokomotiv Tbilisi, where he let in another four in his first game. So it hasn't been an easy ride - but his warrior attitude, 1.96m frame and raw talent saw him through. Some solid Europa League displays for Lokomotiv caught the eye, including against Spain's Granada, when Valencia's scouts took notice. Signed by them in 2021 as third choice, he took full advantage when injuries gave him a first-team chance. Today's he's a €35m-rated prospect linked with Premier League clubs.

As a boy Loria fancied himself as a forward, encouraged by his faithful, ever-present dad at matches and training. But a coach saw things differently, put him in goal, and the rest is history. Loria worked his way up to the country's top side, Dinamo Tbilisi, spending 11 successful years there, before setting off on a nine-year career journey through Cyprus, Russia, Germany and back again. Today, despite his veteran status, he's still a regular for Dinamo and the national side. He is rated as a penalty-saving specialist, and always looks to the sky after a save to thank God and his father, who died several years ago. He's also not afraid of getting stuck in, and was sent off, as a substitute, for his part in the playoff final's mass brawl with Greece.

The 25-year-old Gugeshashvili is already playing for his sixth club, and not without success - Qarabag totally dominate in Azerbaijan, and almost knocked Bayer Leverkusen out of the Europa League back in March. His journey to this point began with his first overseas move, from Dinamo Tbilisi to Jagiellonia Białystok in Poland, at the age of just 16, in 2016. He is now firmly established at Qarabag, and will be a reliable back-up for Georgia this summer. His surname is hard to pronounce, so, as a favour to overseas commentators, he sometimes gives them an alternative. During a loan spell at Recreativo Granada in Spain, instead of having his surname on his shirt, he went with Rachveli - meaning a representative of his native region, Racha.

A proper leader, on and off the pitch. In 2017, Kashia, then playing in the Netherlands for Vitesse, wore a rainbow armband to support the nation's Coming Out Day - resulting in a far-right violent protest outside the Georgia FA's headquarters. Georgia fans, media and politicians backed his stance, and, the following year, after Uefa gave him the #EqualGame award, he said: ""I believe in equality for everyone, no matter what you believe in, who you love or who you are ... I will always keep defending equality and equal rights for everyone, wherever I play."" In December 2018, he received the Presidential Order of Excellence from Giorgi Margvelashvili. He also earned applause in the qualification semi-final against Luxembourg when Georgia's former captain Jaba Kankava came on. Kankava hadn't played since 2020 - so Kashia handed over his captain's armband.

Sazonov's mother is Georgian, his father Russia, and he had a dual-nationality upbringing, spending time living in both countries, speaking two languages. When he opted to play for the Georgian Under-21s, then the senior side, some Russian media branded him a traitor. His dad hit back: ""Saba is no traitor! He has two homelands and he simply chose the one of his parents' homelands. I do not see anything criminal in this."" Sazonov was named in the overall best XI after the 2023 Under-21 Euros, and was recognised as the nation's outstanding young talent at the Georgia FA awards that year. He couldn't get to the ceremony due to commitments with Torino, whom he joined from Dynamo Moscow last year - so his mum and dad received it on his behalf.

Kakabadze's uncle Zurab was a well-known handball player in Georgia who went on to become president of the nation's Handball Association - but little Otar was having none of it, much preferring football, whatever his uncle said. ""In my street nobody played handball,"" he said. ""We all just kicked the ball between two stones."" He was a forward back then, scoring freely, and as he grew began to excel down the right and left flanks. But the coach of Georgia's Under-17 side, Vasil Maisuradze, spotted his potential to operate from the back instead, and the switch paid off. A hugely potent attacking threat from right-back, he has played club football in Spain, Switzerland and Denmark, and moved to Poland with Cracovia in 2021.

After spending 12 years at the highest level in Russia and Ukraine, earning interest from Premier League clubs, Solomon ""Saba"" Kvirkvelia left Metalist 1925 Kharkiv in 2022 following the Russian invasion. As a two-time Georgian player of the year his next move raised eyebrows: he opted to return to his homeland and join Gagra, a displaced team from Abkhazia who play in Tbilisi due to the ongoing Russia occupation of their region. He offered to play for them for free, and to help develop their young players too. After a spell there he made a move to Neftchi of Azerbaijan - then landed a lucrative contract with his current side in Saudi Arabia, where he has tested his skills against Ronaldo. A valued member of the squad this summer.

After an outstanding display in the Under-17 Euros in 2013, 18-year-old Dvali was signed by Reading from Latvian club Skonto, but problems with his visa meant he never made a breakthrough in England. He was loaned back to Skonto, then to Turkey's Kasimpasa, managed by Georgian legend Shota Arveladze. After that came moves to German, Polish, Russian and Hungarian clubs before he arrived at Apoel in Cyprus in 2022. His form there has been good, earning him his spot in this summer's squad; key qualities include strength, experience and a handy habit of scoring goals. He converted his penalty in the playoff final shootout win over Greece. When he's happy he likes to express his joy with a Georgian dance. One to watch.

Lochoshvili played so well in the 2017 Under-19 Euros that he earned a five-year deal at Dinamo Kyiv, but, partly due to three big injuries inside one year, he failed to break through in Ukraine. He then spent time back with his first club Dinamo Tbilisi and with Slovak club Zilina before making a big move to Austria with Wolfsberger, which proved to be the springboard to Serie A and Cremonese. He made headlines at Wolfsberger in 2022 when he helped save the life of Austrian player Georg Teigl who was left unconscious after a serious on-field collision, and had swallowed his tongue. Lochoshvili's instinctive intervention earned him a Fifa Fair Play award, and the Dignity Cross from the Carinthia state governor.

One game changed everything for Gocholeishvili. A previously little-known player at Saburtalo Tbilisi, he didn't make many waves, or command much attention, until he stepped out for Georgia's Under-21s against England on 16 November 2021. His sparkling all-round display peaked when, in the 65th minute, he dribbled through the defence at high speed and scored the decisive third goal - later named by the Georgia FA as goal of the year. Scouts and agents took interest and last year he moved to Ukraine with Shakhtar on a five-year deal. In his first Champions League game, against Barcelona in November 2023, he again stood out and assisted the only goal - earning a place in the Champions League Team of the Week.

A multiple title-winning left-back: not bad for a 22-year-old. He has already played for four teams in his short career, becoming a champion at all of them: Dinamo Tbilisi and Dinamo Batumi in Georgia, Red Star Belgrade in Serbia, and now at Shakhtar in Ukraine. The Montenegrin forward Stefan Denkovic, who played at Batumi with Azarovi, told Serbia's MozzartSport: ""Azarovi is the best left-back I've played with in my career. And not only that, he's probably one of the best in that role I've seen in football. He has incredible technique, speed and sharp movements."" Azarovi was named Georgia's best young player in 2021; his future looks bright.

Lobzhanidze was laser-focused on football from the age of four, training with older children, and with his father in the street, always dedicated to honing ""my dribbling and my shooting ... I like those kind of skills"". It paid off: from Dinamo Tbilisi he moved to Randers in Denmark in 2017, then spent three years in Turkey before last year's big move to the MLS with Atlanta. Off-field hobbies include getting tattoos - current ones include an angel, Thor's hammer, his birth year and a lightning bolt - and watching NBA. ""For me, Kobe Bryant is the GOAT. I grew up watching Kobe. Now my favourite player is Jayson Tatum."" In November last year, at Atlanta's stadium, he asked his girlfriend, actor Sali Keratishvili, to marry him. She said yes.

Once dubbed ""the Georgian Messi"". He was a proper prodigy as a youngster, joining top-flight Tbilisi Lokomotiv at the age of 15 and scoring 22 goals in two seasons from the wing. In 2015, aged 17, he moved to Shakhtar Donetsk under Romanian manager Mircea Lucescu and the future looked bright - but when Lucescu left a year later, the new coach, Paulo Fonseca, left him out of the first-team set-up. Despite impressing in the Uefa Youth League, earning the Messi tag, his career has not gone smoothly since: an unsuccessful move to Nacional in Portugal followed by loans in Turkey and Russia, then a return to his homeland, first on loan at Samtredia, then a permanent move in 2022 to Torpedo Kutaisi. He has done well there, though, and Kutaisi's manager, the former Blackburn coach Steve Keane, still tips him for big things. ""If I ever go to a Premier League team, the first thing I'll do is take Arabidze with me.""

Son of the well-known Georgia player Vasil, Shengelia says he always felt destined to become a professional. His dad did everything to make it happen, moving his son from Kutaisi to train in Tbilisi, and spending every spare minute putting him through his paces. Results were rapid: Shengelia soon became an outstanding performer on Dinamo Tbilisi's left-wing, and, after two free-scoring years, he chose to continue his career abroad, first in Turkey, then Belgium, and now with Panetolikos in Greece. He made a huge contribution to Georgia qualifying for this summer's tournament only to suffer a serious-looking leg injury in the decisive playoff match against Greece. Via some intense rehabilitation, he proved himself fit enough to make the cut.

Tsitaishvili's father Klimenti was the youngest player in the history of the Georgian championships - making his top-flight debut at just 14. Giorgi was born in 2000 in Israel, where his father played, but he grew up in Kyiv and went on to play on the wing for Ukraine at every youth level - including scoring the winner against South Korea in the last minute of the 2019 Under-20 World Cup final. But when the time came to choose a senior national team he told the media: ""I promised my grandfather that I would only play for the national team of my ancestors' homeland - Georgia."" At club level, following the Russian invasion he moved to Poland's Wisla Krakow on loan, then to Lech Poznan, and, last year, to Georgia with Dinamo Batumi.

The most talented of three footballing brothers, Kiteishvili's senior career started on loan from Dinamo Tbilisi to his hometown club Metalurgi Rustavi, where life as a pro wasn't quite how he imagined it would be: the club had no money for salaries, and a training ground with no electricity or running water. But he rose above it. Impressive displays there earned him a shot at Dinamo's first team when he returned, and he took it, growing into the side's most impressive talent and captain, and twice winning Georgia's young player of the year, in 2015 and 2016. He moved to Austria with Sturm Graz in 2018, becoming one of several players branded ""the Georgian Messi"" by the press. An experienced creative talent.

A talented teenager who could make an impact this summer. Sigua played at all youth levels for Georgia, was named the nation's top young prospect in 2021, and made his senior Dinamo Tbilisi debut in 2022 aged 17. His displays earned him a five-year deal at Swiss club Basel last year. Injuries and changes of manager have hampered his progress there, but the future still looks bright. He made his international senior debut in March last year in a 6-1 win over Mongolia, and the Georgia manager, Willy Sagnol, made a flattering comparison. ""He's similar to Leon Goretzka in his style: very busy on the field, hardworking and excellent for his age. He will show what he can do.""

27-year-old Altunashvili is a solid, sharp-shooting pick for the squad, having twice been named the best midfielder in the Georgian top-flight. The fact that he has so far only won a handful of caps is mainly down to the quality of competition in midfield. He made his first move to a foreign club last year when he joined Austria's Wolfsberger, and spoke recently about how it felt to qualify with Georgia for this summer's tournament. ""It's actually hard to put into words how much this means to us as players but also as citizens. Georgians are crazy about football."" One thing he is particularly looking forward to in the group stage: ""It will of course be extremely exciting if Ronaldo actually plays against us. But I have to admit, my absolute favourite is Messi.""

Gagnidze has had a dizzying rise: moving up from Dinamo Tbilisi's academy into the first-team at 17, being named Georgia's best young player, and earning a move to Russian giants Dynamo Moscow at the end of season - having also represented his country at every age group. His potential still seems huge. In 2022 he joined Poland's Rakow Czestochowa on loan. Asked by a journalist whether he preferred eating Polish borscht or Russian buckwheat, Gagnidze replied: ""I have issues around buckwheat. As a child I dropped a pot of buckwheat and got a burn on my arm. So I don't like it anymore. You could say that I have a conflict with buckwheat.""

Kochorashvili played only two matches - 44 minutes on the field in total - in the Georgian top-flight with Saburtalo before leaving the country. He first moved on loan to Spanish club Girona, then made a permanent switch to Levante in 2019. Via a loan spell with Castellón he has since established himself as a solid ball-winner and creative influence - and he stood out in the playoffs for Georgia before this summer's tournament. He scored from the spot in the shootout against Greece in the final - and when Georgia won, he was the only player who stood still in the centre of the field, wide-eyed, not quite believing what had just happened.

Chakvetadze was born in Tbilisi into a family of refugees from Abkhazia, and took his first steps in football with Norchi Dinamoeli before entering Dynamo's academy. His talent was obvious and, after a fine display at the 2017 Under-19 Euros, he was a target for a host of top clubs. He moved first to Gent in Belgium, then to Watford, initially on loan, in 2023. At Gent he was given the number 7 shirt, his favourite number because of his hero, Cristiano Ronaldo. There is a photo of Chakvetadze as a boy staring wide-eyed at Ronaldo at the opening of the Dynamo academy in 2013; 11 years later he is set to come face to face with him again, this time on the pitch.

Spurred on by his grandfather's passion, Mekvabishvili's all-energy displays as a boy were spotted in a youth tournament by a Dinamo Tbilisi coach, who invited him to try out at the club. That coach was Suliko Davitashvili, father of Zuriko, who now lines up in the same Georgia squad this summer as Mekvabishvili. In his early days at the academy Mekvabishvili was played at right-back, then tried at centre-back, before being moved up into defensive midfield, where he excelled. He made his way into Dinamo's first team in that position, then moved to Romania with Universitatea Craiova earlier this year. Away from football he is a huge basketball fan.

An outstanding veteran, the nation's second-most capped player, and twice Georgian player of the year. He made his name in Ukraine in eight years with Dnipro, becoming their captain - with his last appearance before a €1.5m move to French club Reims being in their dramatic 3-2 Europa League final defeat to Sevilla in 2015. He was also remembered at Dnipro for helping save Dynamo Kyiv captain Oleg Gusev who swallowed his tongue during a collision; Kankava cleared Gusev's airway, ending up with bleeding fingers after being accidentally bitten. On 21 March this year, after a three-year absence from the national team, Kankava made an emotional return against Luxembourg, and was handed the captain's armband by Guram Kashia.

Nikoloz ""Nika"" Kvekveskiri was born in the Gali district of Abkhazia in Georgia's north. When he was a year-and-a-half old Russia occupied the territory, so his family fled to a refugee settlement in Zugdidi. He grew up there in tough conditions, but, aged five, developed a stubborn determination to play football, always seen dragging a huge bag with him to training. He remembers those who helped him along the way - including once when a bus driver refused to take him home because he was too muddy, and a driver of another bus told him: ""Hey kid, put something down to cover the seat and sit in my bus, I'm leaving soon."" In the years since he has built a title-winning career in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and now Poland, and has amassed more than 50 senior Georgia appearances, but no goals. Apart from, of course, one important one: the final, winning penalty in the playoff shootout final with Greece.

When the young attacking midfielder made his debut on loan at Telavi from Dinamo Tbilisi, Moistsrapishvili quickly caught the eye - and his progress in Dinamo's first-team when he returned earned links with several big clubs. A loan spell to Beveren in Belgium last year proved a let-down, though: he played just nine times before the move was terminated in March this year. He has shown enough raw talent, though, to earn himself a spot in this summer's squad, and could be one to keep an eye on if he's given a chance. He has played at Under-19 and Under-21 level, and performed well in the 2023 Under-21 Euros.

Only 23, Davitashvili has already played for eight clubs - starting in Georgia with Dinamo Tbilisi before finding his way to France, via Russia. Always highly-rated, he appeared on several lists of emerging prodigies as a youngster, but has struggled to settle down so far. However his four-year deal at Bordeaux, and his solid form to date, suggests that may have changed. His father Suliko played for clubs including Meranil Tbilisi, where one of his teammates was Badri Kvaratskhelia - whose son Khvicha joins Suliko's boy in this summer's squad. Suliko was known as ""Abreza"", meaning ""short gun"", in honour of his lack of height (5ft 4in) and his lethal finishing.

""Kvaradona"" comes from a big footballing family - not just players but also two Fifa referees and one Uefa Media Officer (the author of these profiles). His grandfather Mamiya was a star for Skuri Tsalenjikha and the master of bicycle kicks; his dad Badri was a multiple title-winner in Georgia and Azerbaijan; and Khvicha himself won Serie A's best player in 2022-23, and Georgia's sportsman of the year for 2024. And none of that could have happened but for his mum Maka taking him training in all weathers while Badri was coaching abroad. Khvicha's little brother, 14-year-old Tornike, is also tipped for success. Kvaratskheliais inspirational too: before the playoff victory he gathered the younger players in the dressing room and told them: ""Boys, we are young, but there are some veterans in our team ... For them this chance is the last one to play in a major tournament ... Let's play for them, let's play for our country and win this match!"" And some key trivia: Kvaratskhelia is one of the country's biggest family names, dating back to when Georgia's best cows were the cows of Kvaratskhelia. After occupation by the USSR in 1921, though, private farms were abolished, and the famous cows disappeared.

Zivzivadze started out at Dinamo Tbilisi, spending four years there mainly stuck in the reserves, despite scoring 47 goals in 50 matches one season, and 23 goals in 21 the next. It took him loan spells in Georgia and Denmark to earn a first-team chance at Dinamo, returning there on loan from Esbjerg, where he scored 28 in all competitions. But the move did not become permanent: he set off again via Torpedo Kutaisi and three clubs in Hungary to end up in Germany's second-tier with Karlsruher. His form there, and scoring instinct, make him a favourite for Willy Sagnol - and two goals in the playoff semi-final win over Luxembourg showed why.

When Georgia's FA, and a vocal media campaign, finally convinced the France-born Mikautadze to choose them as his national side in 2021, his mother wrote an open letter. ""Thank you very much for your support. This is very important for Giorgi and he is proud of the fact that you and your colleagues, relatives, friends and the whole of Georgia are with him."" Giorgi himself said: ""Willy Sagnol called me and we talked. He told me that he has been watching me for some time and likes my game, it made me happy. The whole family is with me. I've dreamed of defending the honour of my country's national team since I was a boy."" He joined Ajax from Metz for a reported €16m last year, but failed to make a real impact. He has recovered his form back on loan at Metz, though. So much so that a string of top clubs have been linked.

As a boy at the Dana Cup, one of the world's biggest youth tournaments, Kvilitaia scored a goal in every game, but Danish scouts didn't think he had enough about him to offer further trials. Instead he continued developing back in Georgia's second-tier with the now-defunct Sasco Tbilisi. At 19 he became the first second-tier player recruited by a foreign club when he moved to Hungary with Gyor. In 2015 he joined Georgia's top club, Dinamo Tbilisi, scoring a goal a game in a prolific season, before moving to Rapid in Austria, Gent in Belgium and Anorthosis in Cyprus. He joined current club Apoel in 2021, becoming captain and producing consistent displays. Now, aged 30, he brings a wealth of experience to this summer's squad.",turkish-football.com,news,Turkish Football,Emre Sarigul,0.3176470588235294,454064941,6,,

Mbah visits Austria, woos investors","Gov. Peter Mbah of Enugu has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), with the Austrian government toward the development of the state.

The Senior Special Assistant to Gov. Peter Mbah, on External Relations, Mr Uche Anichukwu, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Enugu.

Anichukwu said the governor also held high level meetings with the Austria senior government officials, the business community and international development partners on investment.

According to him, the governor signed the MoU at Vienna Austria, when he met with the Austrian Minister of Interior,Gehard Karner; Minister of Labour and Commerce, Dr Martin Kocher and Minister of Agriculture, Norbert Totschnig.

Others include the Managing Director of the Austrian Promotional Bank, Bernhard Sagmeister; Director General of the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD), Michael Spindelegge; parliamentarians, among others.

Anichukwu said the country expressed readiness to collaborate with Enugu State government for the mutual benefits of both parties.

This, he said, would help the governor to grow the state's economy from $4.4bn to $30bn in four to eight years through private sector investment and strategic partnerships.

He said at the meeting with Austria's Minister of Interior, Karner, Mbah and his host agreed to partner across various sectors with opportunities in Nigeria for Austrian Small Medium Enterprises.

""As a way of kickstarting a fruitful relationship, Mbah and Karner signed an MOU on behalf of their respective governments for the establishment of a K-9 training unit in Enugu to boost security and crime detection,"" he said.

He explained that the governor's meeting with the country's Minister of Agriculture, dwelt on the implementation of an agricultural model region, measuring about 2,000 to 5,000 hectares, and replicating the Austrian Cooperative success story in Enugu State.

On meeting with Kocher, Anichukwu said the governor expressed readiness to help expand collaboration between Austria and Nigeria businesses.

Most especially in the areas of agriculture, hydro power, work and knowledge in semiconductors, possibly leveraging the already existing Austrian business presence at the European Business Park in Godfrey Okoye University, Enugu.

""Enugu is open for business. We are your trusted partner for business in Nigeria and a stepping stone to Austrian businesses looking for a foothold in Africa,"" he said.

The Senior Special Assistant quoted the managing director of the Austrian Promotional Bank, Sagmeister, saying that the bank was already supporting some Austrian businesses investing in Enugu State.

According to him, the Austrian Promotional Bank was interested in exploring more opportunities to provide guarantees, including guarantees for credits from Nigerian banks, for Austrian businesses investing in Nigeria.

He added that the bank had equally assisted the state government to design creative approaches to procuring foreign funding.

Anichukwu added that Mbah also toured the Spittelau Waste Incineration Plant, which handles 250,000 tons of municipal refuse annually and generates a large proportion of electricity for powering the city of Vienna.

""Meanwhile, the Austrian Chamber of Commerce has invited the Enugu State Government to the next Africa Day in Vienna where the state would boost its chances of investment by meeting with over 300 Austrian businesses with interest in overseas investment and opportunities.

""The Head of International Relationships at the Chamber of Commerce, Michael Otter, said the Chamber was ready to work with Governor Mbah for the mutual benefits of Enugu State and Austria,"" Anichukwu said.

Producers of cement, steel, aluminum, and mineral fertilizers claim they need neither money nor new technologies to enter the CBAM era unharmed. What they need is for Serbia to align its regulations with the EU and apply them consistently, which should encourage the development of a circular economy, facilitate investments in green energy, and protect the domestic market against unfair competition.

These are the key messages from a panel titled 'Decarbonizing industry and business in response to Green Agenda and carbon pricing,' held as part of Belgrade Energy Forum - BEF 2024, which gathered more than 400 participants from 26 countries.

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) imposes tariffs on certain goods imported into the EU. The levy is based on the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases released during the entire life cycle of a product, including production.

Since October 1, 2023, producers of aluminum, fertilizers, cement, steel, and hydrogen, as well as electricity exporters, have been required to measure the CO2 emissions released during the production of the goods they export to the EU. Starting on January 1, 2026, they will be obliged to pay the EU's carbon border tax.

CBAM will affect more than 15,000 people employed directly in four industries in Serbia, and over 50,000 employed indirectly

The first to be affected are the so-called scope 1 emissions - direct emissions released in the production process, during the extraction of raw materials, from precursors (intermediate products), and from the processing of raw materials using technology and energy. The taxation of indirect emissions - those from electricity used in the production process - will begin at a later stage. Producers of aluminum, steel, mineral fertilizers, and cement will be the first to be hit by CO2 taxes, together with state-controlled power utility Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), an exporter of electricity.

The implementation of CBAM will affect more than 15,000 people directly employed in these industries in Serbia, and over 50,000 employed indirectly, according to estimates by domestic companies whose representatives spoke at BEF 2024.

They presented their efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and suggested what regulations the state should adopt or implement. Together, they employ about 5,000 people directly, and about 15,000 indirectly. The introduction of the carbon border tax can change their business overnight and jeopardize jobs.

These companies intend to set up an association of the energy-intensive industries that are subject to CBAM in order to act together, offer solutions, and overcome the challenges in partnership with the state.

In European countries, cement producers are spearheading decarbonization, with the best projects receiving support from EU funds. For example, a project of the Koromačno cement plant in Croatia is 50% funded by the EU, and the total value of the investment is EUR 250 million.

In the cement industry, the primary source of emissions is calcium carbonate from the raw material, stone, as it releases CO2 when heated. The second source is the burning of coal, coke, and other fuels to obtain thermal energy, and the third is logistics, or transport. ""This last source can be solved with electric trucks, but with the first two, everything is in the hands of the regulator,"" says Dimitrije Knjeginjić, CEO of Lafarge Serbia.

Knjeginjić: We don't need to invent solutions - they already exist

He stresses that the cement industry in Serbia does not need additional financial resources or subsidies to reduce CO2 emissions faster.

""We don't need someone to invent solutions - they already exist - nor do we need to reinvent the wheel. We only need to apply what already exists in the EU, to copy their laws come January 1, 2026,"" claims Knjeginjić.

Not much has changed since the previous Belgrade Energy Forum, so the industry is still facing the same obstacles on the path to decarbonization and the use of alternative fuels.

For example, Lafarge Serbia has entered the third year of waiting for Elektromreža Srbije to respond to a request regarding a planned solar power plant.

""However, even if we got to build those 26 MW, that would cover 9% of our annual electricity consumption, and we would still have to buy the remaining 91% on the market, from producers with green certificates,"" he stated.

The cement industry is the biggest advocate of applying all the principles of the circular economy, he asserted, explaining that cement plants come at the end of the chain.

""Everything that can't be recycled, and is bound for landfills, ends up with us. We're trying to convince the authorities to clear at least three cement plants in Serbia for cogeneration. This would allow part of the waste from Ćuprija, Jagodina, and Paraćin to be sent to the cement plant in Popovac, the waste from Požega, Kosjerić, and Užice to go to the cement plant in Kosjerić, and the waste from Novi Sad and all surrounding municipalities to be sent to Beočin. In this way, the waste would be used to produce energy, as a substitute for fossil fuels,"" explained Knjeginjić.

Steel industry representatives warn that in the absence of a national carbon pricing scheme, the introduction of CBAM will result in the Serbian market being flooded with products from countries where these duties are not levied. This already happens from time to time, and there is no adequate protection against it, says Branko Zečević, President of Metalfer Group.

If the EU charges a certain duty on CO2 emissions from imported products, then Serbia must do the same. Otherwise, from January 1, 2026, there will be streams of products whose import into the EU has been blocked, and whose producers will be looking for other markets to sell their goods, according to Zečević. No company and no industry can fight against such dumping, he assessed.

Metalfer realized a few years ago what CBAM would bring, and it invested heavily in decarbonization, he noted. Thanks to these measures, the company today has the lowest carbon footprint per ton of steel produced in all of Europe, according to available data, he claims.

Although this will make it easier to export to the EU, Zečević warns that if the Serbian market remains completely open, it will be flooded with dirty technologies.

""We don't need to invent anything new, we just need to apply the same regulations that exist in the EU. This is the only way we can survive January 1, 2026"", he stated.

Instead of building our own circular economy, we export the raw material to someone else, who builds theirs, and then we import the finished product

One of the main problems for the cement and steel industries is the export of waste products that could be reused in production, while on the other hand, products with maximum CO2 emissions are imported, according to representatives of these companies. They make efforts to use as much recycled products as possible, but they face problems with the availability of raw materials, they revealed. This includes waste steel, an important tool for decarbonizing production.

Zečević explains that Serbia's Law on Waste Management prohibits the export of the types of waste that can be processed domestically.

""In practice, however, these are exported. Export licenses are issued. And this applies not only to waste steel but also copper, aluminum, and slag that could be processed in the country. Instead of building our own circular economy, we export the raw material to someone else, who builds theirs, and then we import the finished product,"" he noted.

Matthias Predojević, Vice President for Corporate Development at Elixir Group

The production of mineral fertilizers is another sector that will undergo major changes when the EU starts charging the carbon border tax in 2026, according to Elixir Group, which has plants in Šabac and Prahovo.

Elixir Group's Prahovo plant, one of six in Europe that produce phosphoric acid, which is used mainly in agriculture, initiated a decarbonization process a few years ago.

The company exports about 70% of its output, with about 50% going to the EU market.

""We already regularly report on CO2 emissions. We also have large customers from the EU, specifically in the chemical industry, who request our data for their own calculations,"" said Matthias Predojević, Vice President for Corporate Development at Elixir Group.

He reveals that the company plans to build a new phosphoric acid factory, as the largest consumer of this acid, noting that 10 MW of electricity and more than 50 MW of thermal energy is consumed in the Prahovo plant.

Elixir Group regularly reports on its CO2 emissions

""For decades, businesses were guided by the optimum capex-opex [capital and operating expenditure]. But today, it pays off to invest more if you have better utilization of raw materials or if the technology is flexible for the use of some secondary raw materials. We strive for all our plants to be integrated, so that a by-product from one plant can be used in another. Circularity does not end inside the factory. For example, phosphoric acid can be recovered even after several cycles. There are companies that use it, both in Serbia and in the EU, so it is no longer waste, but a secondary raw material,"" he stated.

The company also plans to build an industrial waste incinerator. Currently, this waste is exported to Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, as there are no suitable treatment facilities in Serbia. ""We have toured plants in Europe, identified a technology with high energy efficiency, and started developing projects. We are now working with the Ministry of Environmental Protection on obtaining permits,"" Predojević said.

He also revealed that Elixir plans to use 300 hectares of land in Prahovo, by the Danube, to build a solar power plant, a wind farm, and a battery storage facility in order to balance its own electricity production and prepare for the period after 2026.

Mirjana Jukić, Head of Procurement at Messer Tehnogas

One of the key demands of the energy-intensive industries affected by CBAM is faster permitting if they invest in their own electricity production. Although they have different experiences with investments, they share the view that improvements in this field are necessary.

Messer Tehnogas, which produces technical gases, is most exposed to the effects of CBAM through its electricity consumption. ""We are among the cleanest industries, but the year 2026 and Scope 1 are around the corner, and Scope 2 will be there soon after that. We will solve the issue of transportation, and our raw material is clean. But there remains electricity, which must be certified in some way, and our hands will be absolutely tied,"" says Mirjana Jukić, Head of Procurement at Messer Tehnogas.

According to her, companies will likely have to seek ways to ensure alternative sources of energy on their own. According to Jukić, EPS' transition to sustainable sources will be very slow. It has started, and that is great, but it is progressing very slowly, she noted.

The main challenge for Messer Tehnogas is to ensure the supply of green electricity

Jukić says that the company has installed solar panels in most of its locations, with a total capacity about 1.5 MW, but that they cover only about 2% of its electricity consumption.

""We can't cover our consumption from our own sources, and it's very complicated if we want invest further because it's difficult to obtain various permits to build solar power plants on our own plots,"" she added.

She points out that companies are not asking for incentives or funding for their investments. They only want the state to facilitate the existing system and to apply the laws properly so that companies can actually use the facilities they want to build.

""Messer's consumption is ideal for solar, because we don't have a great need for balancing. By building our 15 MW solar power plant, we would cover a third of our consumption. If the entire economy undertook to generate green energy in this way, we would have a double benefit - the consumption of electricity from dirty sources would be reduced and CO2 emissions lowered, while companies would get green energy along with export incentives and certificates,"" Jukić concluded.

Metalfer Group has a similar experience with investments in renewable energy, having installed 3 MW of solar on its roofs. However, according to Zečević, this is a drop in the ocean compared to electricity consumption in steel production, especially at peak times.

""The idea is to cover at least a portion of the consumption with our own production, which also brings us green certificates. I know that [the state] is looking to promote prosumers and legislative changes, but it should be much faster,"" he noted. Also, according to him, those producing electricity for the market and those who produce it for self-consumption should not be treated the same. ""We should have faster and easier procedures, especially if the energy is not delivered to the grid,"" he stated.

Ankica Barbulov, Director of Negawatt Solutions

As far as the state is concerned, the impression is that CBAM has so far been viewed primarily through the administrative and legislative framework, according to speakers at the panel. Among other things, the introduction of the mechanism means that the state has the obligation to align its climate policy with the EU.

This involves harmonizing its ambitions by completing and finalizing the Law on Climate Change, adopted in 2021. By the end of 2023, three by-laws had been adopted. However, more secondary legislation is needed for the law to be fully enforced, so that Serbia can implement its own internal measurement and verification mechanism, which would be overseen by its own accredited institutions, according to Ankica Barbulov, Director of Negawatt Solutions, who moderated the panel.

Completing the law also means establishing a system very similar to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) so that CO2 taxes can be charged within the country.

""That would help preserve the competitiveness of the economy by safeguarding our production from unfair competition. In the same way Europe is protecting itself, we also need to shield ourselves from imported products that are not subject to CO2 taxation,"" added Barbulov.",balkangreenenergynews.com,news,Balkan Green Energy News,,0.192156862745098,454062072,24,https://balkangreenenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/energy-intensive-industries-serbia-CBAM.jpg,eng-9590582
2024-05-364229359,eng,False,2024-05-22,07:26:11,2024-05-22T07:26:11Z,2024-05-22T06:36:38Z,news,0.545098066329956,https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/its-the-economy-stupid/,"It's the economy, stupid","BACK TO NORMAL: Crack out the bunting -- the rate of U.K. inflation has (more or less) returned to the Bank of England's 2 percent target for the first time in nearly three years. The Office for National Statistics just published new CPI data showing inflation in April was 2.3 percent, down from 3.2 percent in March and down from a whopping 11.1 percent high when Rishi Sunak first entered office. It's another shot of economic good news for the prime minister in a largely doom-laden election year -- not to mention some comfort for the millions of Britons who have suffered under the strain of the cost-of-living crisis.

Bring out the big guns: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will hail the win for the government on a victory lap of the airwaves which is getting underway right now. He's got the 8.10 a.m. slot on the Today program before taking on the people's money master Martin Lewis on ITV's Good Morning Britain show (full timings below). Sunak himself will be crowing in a pooled broadcast interview from Downing Street, expected to run before 8 a.m. You gotta take the wins where you can find 'em.

How it happened: ONS Chief Economist Grant Fitzner said: ""There was another large fall in annual inflation led by lower electricity and gas prices, due to the reduction in the Ofgem energy price cap. Tobacco prices also helped pull down the rate, with no duty changes announced in the budget. Food price inflation saw further falls over the year. These falls were partially offset by a small uptick in petrol prices.""

Counter-fire: Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will be meeting Hunt head on, pushing Labour's counter-narrative that ministers are ""gaslighting"" voters who are still very much feeling the impact of the faltering economy. Reeves has her own broadcast clip landing around 9.a.m. and will be on Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show at 1 p.m., before speaking to Andrew Marr for his LBC Radio show later this afternoon.

**A message from Lloyds Banking Group: Everyone needs a place to call home. That's why we've championed social housing for decades and provided more than £17bn to the sector since 2018. Find out more about why this is so important, here.**

A taste of things to come: Reeves tees things up with a punchy article in the Sun, saying she understands ""why a Conservative prime minister who is richer than the king might want to run to the television studios to tell Brits that they've never had it so good."" Ooft. She reckons Sun readers ""just need to look at their bank balances and the price of the weekly shop to know they are worse off."" Labour was also touting analysis claiming the amount families spend on supermarket shopping has risen by nearly £1,000 a year since the last election.

There's even more: The shadow chancellor will also use a Chatham House speech today to accuse the Tories of having ""failed to address the problems that got us here in the first place."" She'll be there with Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy to pledge that their ""securonomics"" approach will balance Britain's economic, security and foreign policy objectives to further bring down inflation. My ace colleague Graham Lanktree has more for Pro subscribers in our Morning Trade UK newsletter.

Put the quill down, Andrew: It makes for a restful day for Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who unusually doesn't have to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why the 2 percent inflation target hasn't been met. Bailey, however, will be keeping his nib sharp, with inflation expected to dart back up a bit later this year.

In the Commons: The inflation stats mean Sunak (and his ankle-swingers) will stride into PMQs at noon feeling somewhat more chipper than usual. Once the to-and-fro with Keir Starmer is out the way, Sunak will celebrate with his Cabinet in a rare Wednesday afternoon meeting -- the usual Tuesday slot having been delayed by Sunak's sudden dash to Austria. While in Vienna, Sunak used an interview with the Mail's Harriet Line to insist his plan is working and that the ""shocks of the past are squarely in the rear view mirror."" Expect much more of this today.

Lectern watch: The combination of a good news day for the government, a Sunak/Hunt media blitz and an unusually timed Cabinet meeting have triggered a fresh bout of chatter that Sunak might, just might, be about to fire the starting gun for a general election. Tory peer (and close friend of David Cameron) Danny Finkelstein poured some fuel on the fire last night, telling his podcast he had ""picked up a bit of talk in government circles"" that given things are unlikely to get much better this autumn, Sunak might as well get on with it now. Watch this space!

On the other hand: Finkelstein went on to say that he doesn't think a summer election will actually happen. And Downing Street is sticking to the line that the government's ""working assumption"" is that a vote will be held in the second half of the year -- though that's hardly going to dampen speculation, given H2 is now little more than a month away.

But it's not all rosy for Rishi ... While Sunak will want to keep the focus on inflation and the improving economy today, Labour Leader Starmer was handed two gleaming PMQs gifts courtesy of the front page of today's Times. He'll surely deploy both in the Commons chamber this afternoon.

HERE'S JOHNNY! A highly critical private memo penned by Johnny Mercer has been made public thanks to a passenger snapping photos of the news-prone veterans' minister writing it on his laptop, yep, on a train to London. The Times got the scoop.

It's tough at the top table: In the wake of the local election results, Mercer accused Downing Street of ""placating"" Sunak by promoting him on social media at the expense of more popular Cabinet members (and potential leadership challengers) Penny Mordaunt and Kemi Badenoch. Mercer blasted No. 10's political communication as ""haphazard, un-themed and loose"" and lamented ""average performers"" such as Transport Secretary Mark Harper representing the government in ""important slots.""

Stop the votes: Mercer also complained that he had been trying to persuade Downing Street to allow veterans to use their IDs at polling stations ""for months without success,"" but was blocked by the PM's special advisers because they feared the move could ""open the floodgates"" to allow students to use their cards, too.

Smiles all round, please: Downing Street was trying to put on a brave face last night, with an official telling Playbook: ""Johnny is a brilliant veterans' minister and a fearless politician and that's why we love him."" But the surreptitious snaps have got to smart.

The real scandal: The pictures also reveal Mercer was riding the Exeter St Davids to London Paddington train on the afternoon of May 6 barefoot. No shoes, no socks -- just raw foot on carriage floor. How that isn't a breach of the Nolan Principles of public life Playbook will never understand ...

LAW AND DISORDER: Having used last week's PMQs to take on Sunak over the early release of dangerous criminals, Starmer will be poring over Matt Dathan's scoop in the Times revealing that police are being told to make fewer arrests because of the severe overcrowding in prisons.

Well well well: Chief constables are being advised to consider pausing ""non-priority arrests"" and to suspend operations that may result in a large number of detentions until there's enough space in facilities across England and Wales, Dathan reveals in a piece that provides yet more dire reading for a Tory party that loves to promote itself as tough on crime.

REALITY CHECK: It's all more evidence of the massive challenges the PM has to try to turn around the Tories' persistently double-digit polling deficit. My Playbook colleague Stefan Boscia and Geoffrey Smith have a piece out today on how the U.K.'s improving economic indicators may not be enough to save Sunak. Some Tory MPs worry the party's record for economic competence is irrevocably broken in voters' minds and that Sunak, like John Major before him, won't get credit for the situation improving. Read the full piece here.

THE 6 MILLION DOLLAR MP

NEVER MIND THE KNOCK ABOUT ... it'll be a massively emotional PMQs too, with cheering and gestures of goodwill expected from across the House as Tory backbencher Craig Mackinlay returns to the chamber after revealing last night that he has undergone a quadruple amputation.

A warm welcome: Sunak is hoping to praise the MP for South Thanet on his first time back in parliament after suffering a life-threatening battle with sepsis. Most of Westminster was unaware of the severity of the near-death experience until last night's airing of Christopher Hope's interviews with Mackinlay and his wife Kati, who will be watching in the Commons public gallery with their 4-year-old daughter. Hope, whose daughter is also an amputee, spent four months working on the documentary for GB News.

Mackinlay's journey: The 57-year-old Brexiteer was admitted to hospital after feeling unwell in September. He awoke from a 16-day induced coma to find his limbs had turned completely black and were like ""plastic."" Mackinlay shared video footage from his hospital bed demonstrating his blackened gangrenous limbs before they were amputated.

Support from colleagues: The MP also told his story to the Telegraph, making the paper's splash. The newspaper reported that Sunak and his predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss were among the MPs to have visited. Mackinlay also spoke to the BBC and appeared on the News at Ten demonstrating the new prosthetics he's received since his arms and legs were amputated in December.

Battling on: Despite all that, Mackinlay is not one of the 65 Tory MPs standing down at the next election and instead will fight to stay on as an MP in Kent. He told GB News: ""I'm hoping people might give me the benefit of the doubt and say, 'That man has been a fighter for himself, he's damn well going to fight for me.' ... The bionic MP is what I want to be."" Last time around, he beat Labour by less than 11,000 votes, making it a tough fight this time around considering the current Conservative polling.

Outbreak of unity: Polly Billington, Labour's pick to stand against Mackinlay in the redrawn and renamed seat of East Thanet, was among the politicians sending their sympathies to ""battler"" Mackinlay. Other highlights from the cross-party showing of sympathy and respect include the Tories' Truss, Andrea Jenkyns and Alicia Kearns, as well as Labour's Chris Bryant and Harriet Harman.

BACK TO THE POLITICKING

WITH AN ELECTION TO FIGHT ... MPs will also have a busy day to row about the hotly contested topic of migration. There's the incoming visas announcement, some statistical warfare and Foreign Secretary David Cameron is in Albania to talk up the partnership tackling small boat crossings. There's a lot going on here, so let's take it chronologically.

VIS-À-VIS: There were reports last night about how ministers will tackle legal migration levels through the graduate visa route. The FT was first to suggest that Sunak has backed away from radical reform to the scheme that allows international students to stay on for two years after their studies, and will permit it to stay open. Hunt, Cameron and Home Secretary James Cleverly are among those said to have warned against targeting students because of fears it could hit growth and hinder Britain's universities. Oh to be a fly on the wall of today's Cabinet meeting ...

The dampeners: A Downing Street official insisted that claims it was backing away from a shake-up are untrue, arguing that ""we are still actively looking at reform options."" But Playbook hears that the FT is on the money about the graduate route remaining open, though there will be a commitment to clamping down on abuse. One Home Office official said: ""We are going to reform the graduate route."" The Sun reports that mandatory English tests will be required for those who stay on, but we'll see if that placates a Tory right that has been clamoring for a more sweeping overhaul.

Frankly, this is all a bit of a mess: Some in Whitehall were saying that the grad visa announcement should come on Thursday, which would mean it coincides with the Office for National Statistics' quarterly net migration figures. But others were saying it won't be this week at all. None of this exactly demonstrates there isn't a row going on behind the scenes.

STAT WARS: The Home Office will bring forward statistics this morning to get ahead of the tougher to handle ONS numbers. At 9.30 a.m. Cleverly's department will publish on gov.uk figures up to the end of April that take into account some of the reforms announced so far. These are expected to paint a more favorable picture, so far as the party's right are concerned, than less up-to-date ONS stats. A Labour adviser accused ministers of ""desperately trying to clean up [their] own mess"" after record highs on net migration. Immigration Minister Tom Pursglove is expected to speak to broadcasters about the stats later.

NO SMALL BOASTS: Cameron is visiting Tirana today for talks with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. The foreign secretary will talk up the ""key role"" their returns agreement is playing in tackling small boats crossings of the Channel and will announce a new initiative to train Albanian judges on tackling organized crime, corruption and money laundering. PA has a write-up.

There's a presser: Cameron and Rama are holding a joint press conference at around lunchtime. The foreign secretary will speak to Reuters later in the day.

WHILE WE'VE GOT YOU, DAVE: The foreign secretary is of course still facing heat over Israel's war against Hamas. Last night Foreign Affairs Committee chair Alicia Kearns disputed Cameron's claim that the International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan's seeking of an arrest warrant for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and over alleged war crimes in Gaza was a ""mistake.""

Legal eagles: The senior Tory MP told LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr that ""some of the best legal minds in the world"" had drawn up the request. ""We cannot in one year say that the ICC is absolutely right and herald it as a great success of the independent legal system around the world, and the next day say it's not right,"" Kearns argued.

SCOOP -- Speaking of which ... it turns out that the U.K. Government had been pushing for Khan to get the coveted job. One official told Playbook that back when he was foreign secretary, Dominic Raab would conclude most meetings he had with foreign counterparts leading up to the decision by ""lobbying for them to vote for Khan."" The insider said: ""As a former human rights lawyer, Raab saw getting a Brit elected to the job of ICC chief prosecutor as a sign of U.K. clout, and because the job was voted on by other countries, winning the job was a real diplomatic coup.""

But but but: An ally of Raab claimed it was ""rubbish"" to say the MP was always bigging up Khan and insisted the government only offered ""tacit"" backing, indicating Khan was ""well qualified and had our support"" only if asked. Still ... that's quite the different position from Sunak now branding Khan's decision as ""deeply unhelpful"" as he hit out at the ICC for drawing a ""moral equivalence"" between Israel's actions and Hamas, as the court also sought a warrant for the militant leader Yahya Sinwar.

TODAY IN WESTMINSTER

THE WORLD VS. PAULA VENNELLS: The event likely to dominate the day outside of pure politics is former Post Office boss Paula Vennells' long-awaited appearance before the official Horizon IT inquiry. It'll be the first time she's spoken publicly about the scandal that saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted in almost a decade. The first of three days of evidence kicks off at 9.45 a.m. and will be streamed on the inquiry's YouTube, as well as likely being picked up by news channels.

Key questions: Westminster will perhaps be most interested to know what the ordained priest has to say about what went on between ministers and top civil servants while the alleged cover-up was going on. There's also the question of whether she lied to parliament during her Business Committee appearance in 2015, when she said she'd seen no evidence of any miscarriages of justice. The BBC has more in a handy primer.

Nice timing: Last night, ITV News published ""smoking gun"" evidence suggesting Vennells described the cases of wrongly accused postal workers as ""very disturbing"" after reading key evidence way back in 2013. Daniel Hewitt has the scoop.

COINS FOR COMRADES: Defense Secretary Grant Shapps will issue a ""wake-up call"" to NATO to increase the baseline of military spending to 2.5 percent. He'll be speaking at the London Defense Conference this morning.

DON'T PANIC! A new government website has been launched to help the nation prepare for the next Covid-like emergency that could batter Britain. Tinned food, batteries and bottled water should be stockpiled, according to the guidance. See write-ups from the FT and the Times for more.

Don't raise the alarm: Deputy PM Oliver Dowden will deliver a speech at the London Defense Conference at 2 p.m to discuss the resilience measures.

UAE AND ME: Dowden held a secret trip to the United Arab Emirates last week in a bid to bolster the diplomatic relationship, the FT reports. The visit, which preceded a trip to Saudi Arabia, came after increased tension caused by comments made inside Westminster about the blocked UAE-linked bid to buy the Telegraph.

GRAY'S MATTER: Labour chief of staff Sue Gray has drawn up a dossier warning Labour may have to grapple with bankrupt councils, public sector pay pressure and the potential collapse of Thames Water if it wins the election, the FT reports. One senior Labour official describes the document to Jim Pickard and the team as ""Sue's sh*t list.""

BENEFITS INQUIRY: The Equality and Human Rights Commission has launched an investigation into whether the Department for Work and Pensions acted unlawfully by failing to make reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities during health assessments. ""We are extremely worried about the treatment of some disabled benefits claimants by the DWP,"" EHRC chair Kishwer Falkner said.

MORE PRISON WOES: The Independent Monitoring Board annual report says a rapidly expanding population is harming all aspects of prison life, citing cases of increased self-harm, child offenders carrying weapons to feel safe, inappropriate placement and physical deterioration of prison buildings.

LONDON'S DIRTY MONEY PROBLEM: Labour MP Margaret Hodge took my financial services colleague Eleanor Myers and others on a tour of properties owned by politicians from authoritarian regimes, including a £4.4 million flat owned by the unofficial step-daughter of Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Polina Kovaleva, and a set of properties allegedly owned by Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev.

Enforcement woes: Hodge told our Morning Financial Services U.K. newsletter that enforcement is one of the biggest issues in the U.K.'s fight against dirty money. Speaking about the fact that Britain hasn't fined any individual or company for sanctions breaches since Russia's invasion, she said, ""It's a depressing example of the failure of all our enforcement agencies to even use the limited powers they have to good effect. If you don't use those powers, if you don't show you mean business, people get complacent.""

DEFENDING IN DEFENCE: A letter from the Prospect union -- signed by other unions, academics and women's rights organizations -- has called for an independent inquiry into sexual harassment in the Ministry of Defence after more than 60 women opened up about their experience of sexual harassment.

MOTHER'S LOVE: Figen Murray, the mother of Martyn Hett, who was killed in the Manchester Arena terror attack in 2017, will today be meeting with Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer to mark the seventh anniversary of the attack. She has walked 200 miles from the spot her son died to Downing Street, where she will be pushing for Martyn's Law, which would require businesses and venues of a certain size to implement proportional protection measures.

COUNTDOWN BEGINS: Interim Chair of the Infected Blood Compensation Scheme Robert Francis told Sky News' Sophy Ridge the scheme should be completed within a year.

MARK YOUR CALENDARS: The Covid-19 inquiry sits from 10.30 a.m. for preliminary hearings in module four, which focuses on vaccines and therapeutics. A warm-up act for Thursday's long-delayed appearance of Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.

THAT ONE: Wylfa in north Wales has been designated as the government's preferred site for the U.K.'s third ""mega-nuclear"" power station. Talks with global energy firms about building it have begun, with DESNZ claiming it could power 6 million homes for 60 years.

STEELY PLAN: Rishi Sunak has been accused of neglecting Welsh steelworkers after a £100 million fund for workers made redundant at the Tata Steel plant was not spent. Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens was demanding that workers made redundant in Port Talbot must be given an urgent guarantee of job support and training -- the Mirror has more.

HACKED OFF: Former MP Dominic Grieve told ITV he suspects his voicemails were hacked by News Group Newspapers when he was attorney general. A spokesperson for the newspaper company told ITV: ""There is no evidence of phone hacking in Mr Grieve's case.""

WHAT THE LIB DEMS WANT TO TALK ABOUT: Analysis by the Liberal Democrats claims that 3.5 million households in England and Wales remortgaged their homes in 2023, resulting in a total £8.8 billion in additional mortgage payments a year. Economic Secretary to the Treasury Bim Afolami said it was ""just another reheated press release from the Liberal Democrats which contains absolutely no plan for the country.""

CAN WE EXPENSE THIS? IPSA Chief Executive Richard Lloyd will address the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers in an end of term private meeting at 5 p.m.

REPORTS OUT TODAY: The IFG found that local authority spending on services for young people and children were cut by 77.9 percent from 2009-10 to 2022-23 ... financial education should be ""bolstered"" in primary, secondary and post-16 education, says the education committee.

BEYOND THE M25

GETTING FLIRTY ON FINANCIAL SERVICES: According to my financial services colleague Hannah Brenton, the top financial civil servants from the U.K. and EU -- Gwyneth Nurse and John Berrigan, respectively -- are meeting in Brussels today to discuss potential financial services cooperation. It's only the second time the two sides have talked about the vital sector since Britain's departure from the bloc in 2020. Given the importance of financial services to London and Brussels, could a rekindled relationship lead to a broader thawing in post-Brexit relations?

**A message from Lloyds Banking Group: A quality, affordable and stable home gives people a foundation on which they can thrive, yet analysis suggests that more than 8.5 million people in the UK cannot access the housing they need. We're calling for the public and private sectors to work in partnership to shape a long-term strategy that creates the right conditions for one million more social homes to be made available for social rent over the next decade. This will require bold action from the Government. Any solution must feature an increase in grant subsidy available to social housing providers and a commitment to a sustainable long-term rent settlement. This, in turn, will help leverage greater private investment in the social housing sector. With financial innovation, fresh thinking and collaboration, the aspiration of a million genuinely affordable homes can become a much-needed reality. Find out more.**

He stressed that Public schools lack essential resources like laboratory equipment and computers, and this disparity is worsened by computer-based exams such as JAMB UTME, which disadvantaged students struggle with due to limited access to technology and electricity.

He suggested incentivizing professional counsellors to study abroad for career management in schools, as Nigeria lacks the necessary programs.

He stressed the importance of cultivating a love for learning over vocational training alone and highlighted the need for entrepreneurial skills rather than just job-specific training.

He advised students to pursue education wherever they find it, focusing on solving real-world problems.

For policymakers, he urged respect and better teacher training, emphasizing the need for STEM education.

With your extensive experience in education advocacy, what are some of the biggest challenges facing students from disadvantaged backgrounds in Nigeria?

""The Nigerian education system was not designed with the poor in mind. Public schools where most of them study are grossly under-resourced largely because children of the rich are not there.

""Those children lack access to laboratory equipment and computers, but we assess them through public examinations that are constructed on the assumption that all Nigerian students are computer literate.

""JAMB UTME is one example that stands out. The test is computer-based, which puts a serious obstacle in the way of poor students with regards to access to higher education in a country where a university degree has been presented to society as a meal ticket. WAEC is moving in the same direction.

""Most of the students I'm talking about don't have access to reliable electricity supply and broadband internet. Now, electricity supply in Nigeria has been configured to exclude the poor from access to the little supply available to the country.

""It is an open secret that in the age we live in, lack of access to electricity and internet spells precarity for the affected individuals. In this situation, social migration will remain a mirage for most disadvantaged people in Nigeria.""

Your doctoral research focused on career management for those from economically disadvantaged families. How can this system be implemented in Nigerian schools?

""We need the human capital to implement it. We don't have that now, but we can start by giving incentives to intellectually capable professional counsellors to go for graduate studies in career management in the UK or North America. We don't offer graduate studies in career management in Nigerian universities currently.

""I know what I know in this field because I studied in the UK and had the opportunity to do further research in this field in countries such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Austria.

""Meanwhile, we can leverage technology to help students who have access to the internet via the work we do at Nigerian Teachers Community. Some of our partners in the UK and Finland are happy to help if relevant education agencies in the country show interest in fixing this major missing link in Nigeria's education system.

""I will continue to help as a private citizen through my career counselling clinic, which is available both physically and virtually.""

You've mentioned projects across Europe and North America. How do these international experiences inform your approach to education in Nigeria?

""Graciously, I benefitted from cutting-edge training in career management abroad, studying in places such as Cambridge University and Austria's Centre for Innovation in Education. My recent research trip to Finland was a big eye-opener.

""My rich international experience makes me realize that our overfocus on certificate acquisition is one of our major obstacles to development. We need to define education and learning properly to ensure that our teachers do not continue to produce seekers of white-collar jobs in a world where young people are becoming multi-millionaires legitimately before they are twenty years old.

""We are bringing UK's top business school to Nigeria to work with about one hundred outstanding teenagers in August this year so those young people can experience early success at a global level. We are also bringing Finland's top teacher-training institution to help about one hundred Nigerian teachers acquire the latest teaching skills so we can start transforming the way we educate our children.

""What we call education in Nigeria currently is mere schooling that does not deliver learning. This must change for national development to take off. Our politicians must understand that education is truly the bedrock of development.

""It is that one thing you fix, and our other problems will evaporate. So, my privileged education and international network have separated my work from what regular educationists do. It's my hope that our governments will take full advantage of what we are doing.""

The new Student Loan Scheme is a hot topic. What are your thoughts on its potential impact on access to higher education?

""It is a good starting point if the spirit of the law establishing it is respected. All that money will be released directly to tertiary institutions in Nigeria. That's my understanding of what the government wants to do. That's a good idea so young people don't borrow money from public coffers and use it to indulge in self-aggrandizement.

""The student loan scheme does not, however, remove the hurdles poor students must overcome in pursuit of higher education. Children of the elites will get the loans because their parents will provide them the tuition services that will guarantee them access since the competition for university spaces remains stiff.

""We are not yet running an equitable education system. We are copying the American model, which has not worked well, even for Americans. Ultimately, we should look in the direction of the Scandinavian countries for good examples to copy.

""Education is a public good. The government must take financial responsibility for it. When you borrow money to go to school, you study what you believe will provide the financial returns that will enable you to pay your loan, not necessarily what you love and have gifts for.

""The system we are putting in place is gravitating towards this unfortunate end. We must correct it as soon as possible if we want a Nigeria that we will be proud of and the country that works well for everyone.""

There's a growing focus on skills development in education. How can Nigerian schools better prepare students for the job market?

""Our children should first be helped to take joy in learning. We should learn for learning's sake. That's how to become curious individuals who ask questions and challenge the status quo. Jobs are created by people who ask questions and make inquiries, not certificate holders who believe that society owes them jobs.

""The brain drain we are witnessing in Nigeria is largely fueled by this unfortunate type of education that makes young people think that it is their certificate that qualifies them for job opportunities. Employers and people with pains are seeking problem solvers and will pay handsome amounts to have their pain points removed.

""I hear a lot about the need for vocational training. The people talking about it most probably mean well, but I don't have evidence that proves that that is what we need desperately in our education system.

""Spending years teaching people how to fix cars, make cake and fix roofs may not be as empowering as becoming critical thinkers, excellent communicators, and leaders. You can learn how to make cake or even repair your water dispenser without spending years in school. YouTube can teach you that for free and will do better than most schools in the world because people make new videos to help you solve new problems.

""I'm an educationist and know that schools don't move that fast. We need entrepreneurs who do not have to be mechanics. They are people with the capacity to take calculated risks that create jobs for thousands of people and solve the problems of millions of people.

""Both our grammar schools and vocational institutions currently lack the capacity to deliver good results in that area. This is largely because the people attempting to produce entrepreneurs for us are not entrepreneurs themselves. You can't give what you don't have. Let's stop putting the cart before the horse.""

Your foundation offers a ""Study Abroad Bootcamp."" What are your views on the role of studying abroad in Nigerian education?

""We need to learn from those who have trodden the path before us, but we should send only critical-minded people abroad for further studies. This is to guarantee that they don't come home and impose Western solutions on Southern problems.

""The people we send abroad for further studies must be people who are patriotic enough to want to return home to help, and we must create an enabling environment for them to come home to help.

""The bootcamps we are associated with accommodate those needs. That's why they are popular with the discerning parents who send their teenage children to benefit from them. We prepare them to withstand the cultural shock they will experience abroad and give them the tools they need to stand out academically and in any other department that matters.

""We are now collaborating with a UK business school to ensure we can make the programme accessible to more teenagers in Nigeria and the wider African continent. It's now called the Rising African Scholars Programme (RASP). I'm happy that I'm making this indispensable contribution to the development of Nigeria and the wider African continent.""

The Nigerian Education Enhancement Project aims to lift millions out of poverty. Can you elaborate on the project's specific strategies?

""The project recognizes that teachers are at the centre of the education industry and that the best brains must be attracted and retained in the industry if we are to move our education forward. Well-trained, recognized, and rewarded teachers will help you get the results you want from education.

""We are doing poorly in this area as a country. The education policy arena in Nigeria is populated by misfits. They are in office to fill the quotas of their benefactors and not because they understand what we need to move our education forward.

""Our Education Enhancement Project is intervening to address those problems by leveraging the skills of our international partners to promote good education practices in Nigeria.

""Over half a million teachers are learning how to teach properly on our platform for free. The study abroad bootcamp we discussed earlier is one of the elements of the project. There are many others.""

Your online communities have garnered a large following. How do you leverage social media to address educational needs in Nigeria?

""In a modern society, people naturally gravitate toward where their friends are. What we have done is to meet education stakeholders in places where they hang out and serve them learning materials in ways that do not disrupt the fun they are having.

""People, including teachers and parents, learn on our platforms in engaging and entertaining ways. The beauty of what we are doing is that they are offered by well-informed people, including professors, for free.

""We are crowd-sourcing learning materials and delivering them for free. Our teachers' platform on Facebook called Nigeria Teachers is approaching three quarters of a million. Teachers ask questions on the platform about their jobs and get free answers in minutes from their colleagues around the world.

""The platform is also a place where teachers come to relax. It's a replication of the typical staff room in a school. We discuss lesson plan, school leadership and romance issues, among others there.

""It has become the most vibrant teachers' platform in the world, and we are getting international recognition for the work we are doing there. We also have other fora for students, parents, spirituality, and even cars for those who love automobiles. They run on a 24/7 basis.""

You offer programs like ""Management Training"" to equip graduates with job skills. How can such initiatives bridge the gap between education and employment?

""Our management training programmes focus on delivering employability skills to tertiary institution graduates. It's an open secret that our universities and polytechnics are not producing the kind of people employers want.

""The programmes we run bridge that gap and help the beneficiaries to gain the skills and confidence they need to do well in selection processes and also do well on the job.

""Most university lecturers lack industry exposure and therefore lack the capacity to prepare their students for what they will meet in the workplace. We don't waste time talking about irrelevant theories. We give them what they need to get the jobs they want or set up the businesses they are dreaming about.

""Interestingly, we deliver everything they need in only one week. They learn what universities struggle to teach them in four years within only one week. They find the experience amazing.""

What are some of the most promising trends you see in Nigerian education today?

""Education technology, homeschooling, and teachers' preference for freelance work.

""Education technology is helping to deliver education to people we cannot reach physically. That's a good thing, given the huge cost of moving from one place to another in today's Nigeria. The fuel subsidy is gone, and it is probably for good.

""More parents are unhappy with the quality and type of education their children are receiving in conventional classrooms and are rebelling against that, especially as it comes at a cost they consider unreasonable. I think they have a point.

""Many teachers do not know what learning means and waste children's time by making them cram a lot of information they don't need and demand parents' precious time through truckloads of assignments their children bring home every day.

""Schools must upgrade if they want to remain in business. The poor remuneration of teachers in Nigeria is driving the freelance movement. This is not good for our education system.

""Relationship stability is one of the qualities of a good education system. That involves school leaders, teachers and students working together for a long time.""

What are the biggest challenges you anticipate for the future of education in Nigeria?

""The brain drain we are witnessing in the industry is a huge challenge. It is robbing us of our best brains. Universities are the worst hit.

""Many STEM departments lack the professors they need to produce the human capital requisite for our development.

""Funding, access, teaching and learning, and governance are also problematic areas. It's my hope that the relevant authorities will find the wisdom to address those challenges urgently.""

In your view, what role can technology play in improving educational outcomes in Nigeria?

""I have already called your attention to what we are using technology to do for teachers. You can extrapolate it to other stakeholders in the industry. Technology when used appropriately, saves you money and time and helps you reach more people in ways that make them truly learn and at their own pace and convenience. We can't ignore the use of modern technology in our education system and remain competitive.""

Drawing on your experience, what advice would you give to a young Nigerian student passionate about education?

""Define education properly. Schooling does not automatically result in education. Get the education you want wherever you can find it. That place doesn't have to be called a university.

""The Nigerian education system takes too long to deliver what looks like education, but when scrutinized, it is not education but knowledge that may be useless.

""Find out what people with problems want. Get the skills that will solve those problems and learn how to promote yourself to people who need what you can do.

""Remember to study what you love and not what will give your parents bragging rights in the short run and make everybody unhappy in the long run.

""Invest in the acquisition of principles that endure not just the information you need to pass exams and earn a certificate that no one may ever bother about. People hardly ask me for my certificate. What puts food on my table comes through referrals.

""As Emerson said, 'if you do better jobs than others, the world will make a bitten path to your door even if you live in the woods.'""

As a leading education figure, what message do you have for policymakers on improving Nigerian education?

""Give teachers the respect, recognition and rewards they deserve. We are not aware of any education system that delivers results without teachers. Train them well for their jobs and give incentives to young people to study education courses, especially in STEM areas.",naijanews.com,news,Naija News,Ikenna Ngere,-0.01960784313725494,454054766,8,https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Students-Loan.webp,

Alcazar Energy Partners II was also backed by Austria's development bank and several industrial groups, co-Founder Daniel Calderon told Reuters, and ended just shy of a $500m target despite a tough fund-raising environment.

The new backers join an existing group of leading investors including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and insurer Allianz, which signed up before the first close of the fund in 2022.

The second fund has already begun building a portfolio of assets in the western Balkans region, with two wind farms totalling 456MW, part of fund strategy to develop more than 1.6GW of clean energy across a range of markets.

Once operational, the fund's investments are set to mitigate 3-million tonnes a year of greenhouse gas emissions, while generating enough electricity to power more than 300,000 households, Alcazar said.

The western Balkans is a particularly attractive as an investment destination as the region looks to wean itself off climate-damaging coal power and a reliance on fossil fuel imports from countries including Russia.

Economies not in the European Union are also being incentivised to cut their grid emissions to help exporters avoid taxes when they sell into the bloc, which is setting tougher rules based on the carbon content of some imports.

""If you reduce (use of fossil fuels) ... and make it heavier on wind and heavier on solar, then you're going to be helping the local economy in a big way,"" Calderon said.",businesslive.co.za,news,BusinessLIVE,,0.3019607843137255,453979945,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mgHBQuCRaXLj0O8fBYKBdjETQgTXpaXeuOUA3E-0T1mwAcCdb3zEsMbhABKbp8n4uu99UbaY5IL2R3Rwpqx7XZOlUPxi6vswRtlFw5FmBG1C5Q=s1000,eng-9586282

In middle school, Nat and Julian played for what would become the FAMU Marching 100, and in high school they jammed with Ray Charles in Tallahassee night clubs.

After college and military service the brothers moved on to New York City in the 1950s and became international jazz legends.

Trumpeter Nat joined the Woody Herman sextet, Julian, a saxophonist known as ""Cannonball,"" landed with the Miles Davis sextet.

The two also formed The Cannonball Adderley Quintet, and in 1960 scored a national hit with the ""Work Song,"" inspired by a chain gang at work on Tallahassee's Pensacola Street.

""They used convict labor to pave the street. The convicts used that call-and-response method to sing as they worked,"" recalled Adderley in a 1994 AP interview about the lyrical playfulness he fused with soul, jazz, funk and blues in what became his biggest hit and a jazz standard.

Competing amidst a British invasion of American popular music in the mid-1960s, Cannonball topped the jazz, R&B, and pop charts in 1966 with ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.""

When a stroke claimed Cannonball a month before his 47th birthday, Gov. Reuben Askew declared September 15, 1975, Julian ""Cannonball' Adderley Day across the state of Florida.

Nat died in 2000 of complications from diabetes. He was 68.

Both are buried in the Southside Cemetery in Tallahassee.

A Sparta, Tenn., nurse met an internist at a Memphis hospital in 1961, they married and moved to Tallahassee. Al McCully would be the third urologist to open a practice in the city, while Jean is remembered as a volunteer extraordinaire - Tallahassee's ""can-do woman.""

She raised money for the Girl Scouts' overnight camp. Served on the Boys and Girls Club of the Big Bend, The Girl Scouts, and the James Madison Institute. Was president of the Garden Club.

She also was an original volunteer with the Red Hills Horse Trials. Jean cooked breakfast for the judges and then led botanical tours of the grounds.

McCully joined Friends of the Library when the library was housed in a former Elks Club and promoted construction of the block-sized downtown facility and its six branches

In 1983, Jean McCully successfully lobbied the director of Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare to bring hospice under the hospital umbrella. In a single day, she raised $60,000 to bring ballet superstar Mikhail Baryshnikov to Tallahassee for a performance to benefit the program.

""It's not like she would strut on stage. You never knew she was involved,"" recalled Marjorie Turnbull at McCulley's passing.

""You had to ask, 'Jean, did you do that?'""

The Jean McCully Family House at the Big Bend Hospice campus on Mahan Drive recognizes her work for the community.

Romero Mitchel Sealey (1889 - 1928)

R.M. Sealey arrived in Tallahassee from Fort Myers in 1916 to become principal of Leon High School and over the next 12 years would shape the course of Florida public education for much of the 20th century.

""Few men have had such an overwhelming and beneficial impact on a city [Tallahassee] in such a short amount of time,"" Florida State College of Women President Edward Conradi wrote upon Sealey's death in 1928. ""His accomplishments as both a leader and a friend are truly unparalleled.""

In Fort Myers, Sealey led the Gwynne Institute and had solicited Thomas Edison and Henry Ford as supporters to build that city's first high school. He continued to promote public education in Tallahassee as the Superintendent of Leon County Schools and then the state Superintendent of High Schools, where he standardized high school curriculums and testing requirements.

Sealey also established the Florida Education Association and organized Tallahassee's first Boy Scout Troop.

While enroute to the National Education Association convention in Boston in 1928, the 39-year-old Sealey suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in Washington, D.C.

""Although he was a man among men. He was never too busy to talk to a boy or girl about concerns and to provide the advice and encouragement to help them achieve their goals,"" said Bunyan Stephens, pastor of the First Baptist Church.

The entire student body of Leon High School attended the service and burial at Oakland Cemetery. The Tallahassee Dailey Democrat described the funeral as one of the largest in city history.

Sealey Elementary School on Allen Road is named in his honor.

John McIver (circa 1800)

On April 9, 1824, John McIver led the first group of white settlers to Tallahassee. A horse-drawn wagon from North Carolina carried seven pioneers; two white men, two women, two children, and a mulatto man on a mission to build a log cabin to serve as a capitol building for the new Florida territory.

The group pitched a camp on a hillside south of the present-day intersection of Apalachee Parkway and North Monroe Street. Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley speculated it was probably located along present-day Gaines Street.

Replica in the works: City to recreate first Capitol - a log cabin - for bicentennial celebration this year

TLH 200: Cascades bicentennial journey: Waterfall to baseball field to brownfield to pinnacle park

McIver said the site was on a southern slope overlooking what could very well be a picture book fairyland.

""To the southward and westward, the country opened to view like a magnificent park, gently undulated and studded with beautiful basins of limpid water, at their feet a crystal fountain gushing from the declivity of the hill; to the eastward the view was more confined by the thick foliage of the undergrowth which served to screen the view through not the sound, of a beautiful cascade,"" he wrote in the ""Memorial of John McIver of the City of Tallahassee.

The group cleared a site on top of the hill, two Gadsden County planters sent slaves to help build a cabin and two annexes. The work was completed in time to accommodate the Legislature's first Tallahassee session that November, and within a year more than 50 homes and two hotels were constructed.

McIver would stay in town. He would become the first Territorial Clerk of the City of Tallahassee and the auctioneer for the sale of the first house lots sold.

Lucille Baldwin Holliday Brown (1922 - 2019)

Born and raised in the historic Smokey Hollow neighborhood, Brown is remembered as someone who loved history, books, and laughter. Brown worked as a librarian in Leon County Schools at Bond Elementary, Bellevue Middle School, and Griffin High School - and sold encyclopedias in her spare time.

In the 1940s, Brown and Gladys P. Anderson pushed to open the library at the then Black-segregated Lincoln High to the adult public. Principal Gilbert Porter explained to the Tallahassee Democrat that there was a ""dearth"" of reading material in Black households.

In addition to its collection of books the school library also had subscriptions to the Tallahassee Democrat, several Florida newspapers, the Atlanta Constitution, The Baltimore Afro-American, the Sunday New York Times, and the Christian Science Monitor.

Brown worked for the county school district for 39 years and in the latter part of her career took a night job at the public library.

""Back then, there was never an African American that had worked in a library,"" recalled Riley Museum Founder Althemese Barnes at Brown's passing. ""So, we were happy to see her there.""

Blanche ""Bunky"" Atkinson (1929 - 2022)

Blanche Younis Atkinson was born in Tallahassee to Lebanese immigrant parents who ran a peanut/hamburger stand on Adams Street where the House Office Building stands now.

She was a registered nurse with the Leon County Health Department and married to Glenn F. Atkinson. They would have four daughters.

Bunky went to work for the county's civil defense during the Cuban missile crisis and stayed with the agency as its mission shifted from war to peacetime concerns of natural disaster response and hazardous waste management.

Atkinson was director of Civil Defense and Emergency Preparedness for Leon County in 1985 when Hurricane Kate roared through Tallahassee's urban forest and paralyzed city roads with downed trees that left most of the city without electrical power.

Atkinson wanted to impose a curfew until the roads were cleared, but state emergency management officials told her there were no procedures to do so.

So, she wrote an outline for how a community could require residents to remain indoors after the sunsets and presented it to County Commission Chairman Lee Vause and Tallahassee Mayor Hurley Rudd to sign.

""She knows how to get things done. She'll talk you out of an arm and a leg,"" recalled former Tallahassee Police Chief Melvin Tucker at Atkinson's retirement in 1987.

A curfew was imposed from 7 p.m. Friday, Nov. 22, to 7 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 23, 1985. It allowed for only law enforcement, and road and utility workers to be outside.

By Saturday afternoon enough tree litter was cleared from the roads and electricity restored to lift the curfew.

""I think it's the only 24-hour period in Tallahassee history where there was not a single crime, not a single arrest. Everybody stayed home,"" Atkinson told Tallahassee Democrat's Gerald Ensley on the 25 anniversary of Kate.

Clyde Spencer (1916 - 2005)

Clyde Edward Spencer had a life-long love for trains. After he graduated from high school in New Smyrna Beach he got a job with the railroad, married Sara Lee Boynton, and moved to Tallahassee.

Spencer was the railroad round-house foreman in charge of maintenance of all the locomotives that moved troops and supplies between Tallahassee and Fort Gordon Johnson during World War II.

In 1948 he left the railroad and with proceeds from a patent for a device that extracted gum turpentine out of wooden barrels. He then opened the Royal Sandwich Company.

From a Gamble Street storefront, he catered to state office buildings and universities.

Spencer deployed trucks and vending machines, supplying sandwiches, soda, and cigarettes to 125 locations across the city and at the airport in the 1950s.

Once Florida State University fielded a football team, Spencer, a founding member of the Seminole Boosters, would employ up to 150 teenagers a game to hawk Coca-Colas, hot dogs, and peanuts at Doak Campbell Stadium.

""Why half the boys that have grown up in this town have worked for me out there. I'm proud when they tell me I gave them their first job,"" Spencer told Tallahassee Democrat Editor Malcolm Johnson for a 1974 article on a change in federal child labor laws.

Spencer closed his sandwich and concession businesses in 1975. He became a developer and built several apartment complexes near the universities.

George Lewis II (1913 - 1996) and Clifton Lewis (1919 - 2014)

George Lewis II was the great grandson of B.C. Lewis, founder of the Lewis State Bank in 1856, and served as the CEO through the 1950s and 1960s. Under George, Lewis State Bank provided home and business loans to the Black community when other financial institutions refused to do so. It was also the source of bail money for protesters during the bus boycott and other demonstrations.

George was also a member of the Florida Advisory Board of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

Know their names: A roll call of civil rights leaders who helped shape Tallahassee

Clifton was in the first first-grade class at Caroline Brevard Elementary School, graduated from Leon High School as the 1936 Tallahassee May Queen, and is remembered for her love of art, people, and good government.

Clifton began what would become the LeMoyne Art Foundation in the lobby of the Lewis State Bank and was the first president of the board for what would become the Tallahassee Museum of History and Natural Science.

She also lobbied the Governor and Cabinet, and the Leon and Tallahassee commissions to televise their meetings on public television. Local legend holds her dissertation-length presentations at local meetings resulted in both the city and county commissions setting time limits for public comments.

George and Clifton convinced architect-artist Frank Lloyd Wright to design a home for them in Tallahassee. The Lewis Spring House on Ohkeeheepkee Road was completed in 1954 and served as their home until their respective deaths.

The Lewis Spring House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. In 1996, Clifton formed the Spring House Institute Inc., to transform the Lewis home into a teaching institute for the arts and humanity.

Rev. King Solomon Dupont (1903 - 1983)

King Solomon Dupont was the grandson of a man bought in Virginia and enslaved on a farm 12 miles west of Tallahassee. In 1957, he was the first Black candidate in a city election.

Dupont served as the lead pastor at Fountain Chapel AME Church and a founding member of the Inter-Civic Council, which organized the 1956 bus boycott.

The only issue the white incumbent Davis Atkinson wanted to discuss was how his opponent was ""a candidate who is owned lock, stock, and barrel by the Negro InterCivic Council and the NAACP, two organizations whose only existence is for the purpose of the integration of the human races, a program of mixing just to be mixing.""

Dupont said he was concerned about high utility rates, and ""better living quarters for low-income families.""

Three plate glass windows at a Black grocery store were smashed by bricks, one which police said had an obscene note attached warning Dupont not to run. At night white youths would drive by Dupont's church and residence hurling insults.

Voter registration surged - a more than 40% increase to 13,000 - and the number of ballots cast more than doubled compared to the previous election.

With three quarters of registered voters white, Atkinson won reelection with 74% of the vote.

Data expert Matt Isbell's analysis of precinct results reveals a near perfect correlation (0.99) of race to vote. Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley also crunched the numbers and concluded no Black Tallahasseeans voted for Atkinson and 87 whites voted for Dupont.

It would be another 14 years and eight unsuccessful Black candidates before a Black person won an election in Leon County: James Ford would successfully walk the path first blazed by Dupont and win a city commission seat in 1971.

Dupont is included in the Tallahassee Civil Rights Oral History collection of interviews conducted by Dr. Jackson Lee Ice during the summer of 1978.

His name is one of 50 Civil Rights Foot Soldiers engraved on the Civil Rights Heritage Walk Memorial along Jefferson and Monroe streets. And both Dupont Drive and King Solomon Drive off of Wahnish Way are named in his honor.

Charles Louis Napoleon Achille Murat (1801 - 1847)

Charles Louis Napoleon Achille Murat was known as Achille and was the eldest son of Joachim Murat, the brother-in-law of Napoleon and King of Naples. When Napoleon was exiled, in 1815 Murat's father was executed and the rest of the family fled to Austria.

Seven years later, Murat took a room in the same Washington, D.C. boarding house as Richard Keith Call, the Congressional delegate for the Florida territory.

The two became lifelong friends and by 1825 Murat bought a plantation 15 miles east of Tallahassee.

He named it Lipona, an amalgamation of his native Naples. A year later Murat married Catherine Daingerfield Willis Gray.

Murat took the oath of citizenship in present-day Jefferson County and became an attorney, county judge, and director of Union Bank.

Murat would purchase three plantations in the area. While he spent much of his life trying to recoup his family's lost fortune, he lived long enough to see Union Bank foreclose on The Lipona.

Historians consider Murat a man of eccentric ways.

He had an aversion to water internally or externally. He never drank it without adding whisky to it.

He rarely bathed. Once, while onlookers feared he would be scalded after falling into a vat of syrup on a sugar plantation, Murat's only comment was, now ""Kate will make me wash.""

Murat kept a shaggy dog to use as a spittoon and cooked and ate all kinds of animals. Among his culinary experiments was an alligator-tail soup, which he wrote was ""a little better than turkey buzzard soup.""

He found New Orleans to be home to """"the worst descriptions of French literature,"" North Carolina ""a bad imitation of Virginia,"" and Charleston, S.C., ""the city par excellence.""

Ralph Waldo Emerson was caught in a storm at sea with Murat and described him, as ""a philosopher, a scholar, a man of the world; very skeptical but very candid, and an ardent lover of truth,"" with ""manners elegant to perfection.""

But the historical record does not always support Murat's account of frontier Florida.

He and David Macomb dueled at Lake Iamonia either because Murat's hungry slaves stole Macomb's hogs or because Macomb supported Kentucky Sen. Henry Clay in a dispute with President Andrew Jackson.

Murat's bullet pierced Macomb's cloak without touching skin. Macomb shot off the little finger on Murat's right hand.

Murat would pass in Tallahassee with Catherine by his side. His last words were said to profess his love for her.

Achilles and Catherine are buried in the St. John's Cemetery. Their graves are marked by unobtrusive shafts of marble.",tallahassee.com,news,Tallahassee Democrat,Tallahassee Democrat,0.1607843137254903,453978873,1,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/21/PTAL/73779788007-n-042173.jpg?auto=webp&crop=599,338,x0,y98&format=pjpg&width=1200",

The green bond including biodiversity for EUR 500 million with a term of 7 years was extremely well received by the investor community in a competitive environment and was therefore oversubscribed more than 6 times at the peak. The high demand made it possible to set the interest rate at an attractive level of 3.250%.

VERBUND intends to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the bond for green projects that are in line with the VERBUND Green Financing Framework, updated in May 2024. The green financing framework was examined by the internationally renowned sustainability rating agency ISS ESG and provided with a second party opinion (available at www.iss.esg.com), which confirms compliance with the EU taxonomy (from November 2022), the Green Bond Principles 2021 (with appendix from June 2022) and the EU Green Bond Standards.

VERBUND intends to use up to 90% of the proceeds from the bond to finance the construction of the 380 kV Salzburg high-voltage line (Salzburg line). The Salzburg line is a key section of the 380 kV high-voltage ring in Austria, which forms the basis of the country's electricity supply and is therefore of great importance for regional, national and European supply security. With the Salzburg line, which leads to a significant increase in the east-west transport capacity within Austria, the renewable energies generated in eastern Austria can be transported to the pumped storage power plants in western Austria. In this way, the management contributes to the implementation of the Austrian energy strategy and to achieving the Austrian climate protection goals.

In addition, VERBUND intends to finance the projects ""LIFE Riverscape Lower Inn"" and ""LIFE Project Blue Belt Danube Inn"" (the ""Biodiversity Projects""). The biodiversity projects are part of the VERBUND program to improve ecology and biodiversity around hydropower plants in Austria and Bavaria (Germany). An essential design feature of such concepts are bypass rivers, which restore continuity and at the same time provide important habitats for fish, amphibians, water-bound birds and many other rare river meadow species. After completion of the biodiversity projects, the continuity of the VERBUND power plants on the Danube and Inn shall be fully ensured.

In the past, VERBUND has achieved several milestones in the field of Green Finance: The first Corporate Green Bond of a DACH company in 2014, the world's first digital ""Green Schuldschein loan"" and an ESG-linked syndicated loan in 2018, a ""Green & Sustainability-linked Bond"" in line with the EU Taxonomy in 2021, as well as an ESG-linked promissory note in 2022 and a Sustainability-linked syndicated loan in 2023.

It may be available only for a limited time on this website.

In part two of Lubrication from Stone Age to Modern Age (Technical Bulletin 89), we slid through 145 years of action-packed lubrication history and left off towards the end of the Gilded Age, full of hope and fuelled by endless technological possibilities. What was not to love? We had electricity, telephones, toasters, cars on the road, planes in the air and plenty of oil to lubricate the machines born of our wildest imagination.

The next leg of our journey finds us in the closing years of the late modern period. This was a time of unprecedented change and upheaval, and the events that would unfold over the coming decades would reshape the world in a profound way.

This was the quiet before the storm, the eve of the first world war and what would become the start of the bloodiest chapter in human history. Also called The Great War, World War one (WWI) would claim the lives of over 20 million people in four years and set the stage for yet another world war just 20 years later.

The sad truth is that war creates the conditions for great advances in technology, and so it was for those early years of the 20th century, where we saw significant discoveries, inventions and innovations across various fields.

Honourable mentions from this time period include the theory of special relativity, the principles of quantum mechanics, Rutherford's Nuclear Model, and the discovery of penicillin and insulin. As for inventions, there was the assembly line, television, motion pictures, the electric refrigerator, the zipper and all that jazz.

Guest appearances include Ernest Rutherford, Robert Goddard, Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Alexander Fleming, Admiral Richard Byrd and Sigmund Freud - the Austrian psychoanalyst with mommy issues.

1908 CE

Demand for crude oil continued to increase steadily as the second industrial revolution drew to a close and petroleum based lubricants became commonplace; but things were about to go into overdrive, thanks to one man with an audacious dream - Henry Ford, the man who put the world on wheels.

The development of the Model T began in 1907, when Henry Ford and his team set out to create an affordable, reliable, and efficient car that could be produced in large quantities for the general public. That dream became reality when the first Model T Ford or ""Tin Lizzie"", as it affectionately became known, rolled off the assembly line in October of 1908. The engine lubricant of choice for this contemporary engineering marvel was an additive-free SAE 30 monograde oil produced by Veedol, called ""Fordol"", which also served as transmission fluid.

Prior to the introduction of the assembly line system in 1913, the record time for building one Tin Lizzie stood at just over 12 hours. Under this new system, a car could be assembled in 1 hour and 33 minutes allowing Ford to produce 1,000 cars a day.

Mr Ford, in a controversial move, also raised the minimum daily wage for factory workers from $2.34 to $5 and reduced their working hours. The morning following the wage hike announcement 10,000 men showed up at the Ford Michigan plant eager for a job.

This altruistic gesture was not borne out of charity, but good business sense - his workers could now afford to buy the vehicles they built, which created loyalty towards Ford and sparked a rise in middle-class consumerism among workers. Happy workers, happy assembly line.

1909 CE

In 1899 Charles ""Cheers"" Wakefield, an oil man by trade, quit his job at the Vacuum Oil Company, part of the Standard Oil Company, and founded CC Wakefield & Co. in London.

As the patent holder for an automatic steam engine lubricator, Wakefield initially focused the company's efforts on the rail business, but as an entrepreneur and technophile it was the fledgling motor vehicle and aviation industries that captured his imagination, and so the company started developing lubricants especially suited to the engines in these wheeled and winged mechanical marvels of the 20th century.

In 1909, while experimenting with different oil blends, Wakefield's lubricant researchers discovered

that adding a relatively small proportion of castor oil from castor-bean seeds to their lubricants, achieved a desirable viscometric balance. This resulted in a product that was viscous enough to function effectively at high temperatures, while also remaining sufficiently fluid at cold start-ups.

In light of this breakthrough, they coined the new product ""Castrol"", to signifying the key ingredient, castor oil, in their innovative lubricant formulation. They initially produced five variants for different applications, with Castrol R being the flagship product intended for high-performance aero and racing engines. Castrol would go on to be used in non-rotary engine applications during WWI.

Soon afterward, Wakefield positioned his company with racers, sponsoring pilots, riders and drivers. Over time, the Castrol brand became synonymous with racing-world speed and endurance records.

In the late 1930s, Wakefield coined the Castrol slogan ""Fluid Engineering"", which would eventually evolve to its contemporary tagline - ""It's more than just oil. It's liquid engineering."" In 1960, with the name of their most prominent product famed the world over, the Wakefield company officially became Castrol Ltd. Cheers, Mr Wakefield!

1911 CE

The age of the automobile was truly upon us, and with development of the internal combustion engine came the demand for better lubricating oils. Recognising a need for a system of standardisation, the now well-established Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) introduced the first of many engine oil classification systems based on viscosity in 1911. The system was intended to reflect how suitable an oil was for use as an engine lubricant, and at the same time be easy for consumers to understand.

That initial specification defined five different numbered grades of engine oil based on their viscosity at 100°C - SAE 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50, with a sixth grade (SAE 60) being defined later in 1926.

1913 CE

Friedrich Bergius was a German chemist and pioneering researcher who came from a long line of scientists. In 1913, he developed a method for transforming a solid form of coal (lignite) into liquefied oil by exposing the lignite to hydrogen gas under high pressure to form hydrocarbon-based fuels and lubricating oils.

For his efforts, Friedrich was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1931, which he shared with his corecipient, Carl Bosch - the German scientist who developed the Haber-Bosch process. Friedrich is considered one of the most important German chemists of the 20th century.

1914 CE

Aircraft design came a long way in the ten years between the Wright brothers' first flight in 1903 and the outbreak of World War I (WWI) in 1914. This was a transformative time marked by significant advancements in aviation technology, pioneering flights, and the emergence of early aircraft engine manufacturers, who were experimenting with inline and rotary engines.

WWI was the first major conflict involving the large-scale use of aircraft, and introduced a 19th-century world to more modern ideas and technologies, many of which required lubricants.

The concept of ""air superiority"" was unheard of before 1914 and there was no such thing as a fighter plane, but both sides of the conflict quickly recognised the advantages of creating flying war machines, and worked relentlessly throughout the war to develop faster, bigger and deadlier fighters and bombers. Winning the war in the skies became a tactical necessity during the Great War Initially the main military role of aircraft was reconnaissance, but at the start of the war, these reconnaissance planes were such a novelty that enemy pilots would actually wave at each other as they crisscrossed the front lines. It wasn't long before the strategic importance of spy planes sunk in, and with it, a burning desire to shoot the enemy's aircraft out of the sky.

In early skirmishes, these slow-moving reconnaissance planes would take pot shots at each other with service pistols and rifles but with the breakthrough design of Anthony Fokker's ""interrupter gear"" in 1915, front-mounted machine guns could fire a continuous barrage of bullets safely through the plane's rotating propeller blades. All pilots had to do was aim the nose of the plane at the enemy and fire. This ingenious device would make its world debut in one of Fokker's creations, the E.1 Eindekker Scout.

And, so for the first time, planes took to the air with the express purpose of air-to-air combat, and the winners of most early ""dogfights"" were the pilots flying the better technology with the most robust engines.

So, let's take a look at the power behind the prop and how these engines shaped the lubricants used.

Rotary engines were the most ubiquitous aircraft motors available during the Great War. In fact, some estimates claim they powered as many as 80 percent of aircraft - mostly Allied fighters. These air-cooled engines were known for their simplicity, reliability, and lightweight design, making them popular choices for the aircraft of that era.

All rotary engines manufactured during this era trace their origin to the archetypal aeronautical rotaries - The Gnome engine. Even though developed by a French engineer and produced in France, these engines were also produced under license in many countries by other manufacturers, such as Le Rhone, Clerget, Bentley and Oberursel. They powered outstanding fighter planes, including the British Sopwith Camel and the Bristol Scout, as well as the French Nieuport.

While German aircraft manufacturers tended to prefer inline water-cooled engines, prominent aircraft manufacturers like Fokker mounted rotary engines in their winged creations like the Fokker DR.1. This was the iconic triplane that would become synonymous with Germany's most prolific fighter ace and the top ranking fighter pilot of WWI - Manfred von Richthofen, aka the Red Baron - who terrorised the skies over the western front with his Jastas 1 squadron, which was often referred to as the ""Flying Circus"" on account of the unit's brightly coloured fighter planes and agility in aerial combat.

Regardless of make, all rotaries shared a total-loss oil system, in which oil would mix with the fuel in the crankcase before entering the combustion chamber.

As the engine operated, the oil was burned along with the fuel, and some of it was expelled with the exhaust gases. This ensured that the engine was adequately lubricated during operation.

However, rotary engines were not without their issues. They were prone to high oil consumption due to oil leaks, and the total-loss oil system necessitated carrying a surplus of lubricant since these engines were known to spray over two litres of oil into the air for every hour of operation. Running out of oil mid-flight undoubtedly invited total engine failure and a fatal end to one's flight.

And the lubricant of choice for these rotating marvels of the sky? Castor oil.

During WWI, the choice of engine technology that was used to power birds of war was dictated by the availability of resources like fuel and, more relevantly, lubricants. The readily available castor oil was the mainstay for aircraft engine lubrication in England and France, where rotary engines were widely used.

The United States had no independent source of castor oil, but it did have ample supplies of petroleum, which it supplied to Britain and France and also used to produce lubricants for its water-cooled engines.

However, distillation of specifically designed crude oil products, like lubricants, was still in relative infancy, in terms of technology, scale and consistent quality.

The Luftstreitkräfte (German air force) primarily used water-cooled engines in their aircraft, which required mineralbased lubricants, but they also had fighters and reconnaissance planes with rotary engines, which could only run effectively on castor oil.

While Germany had advanced oil-refining capabilities at the outbreak of WWI, they imported most of their crude from Austria-Hungary (a dual monarchy at the time) and Romania. Things went pear-shaped when Romania joined the Allies in 1916 - Germany no longer had access to the light crude oils needed to run their war machines.

Not deterred by this change of heart, German forces recaptured the Ploiești oil fields in a counter-attack, but the Romanians had destroyed all of the above-ground stocks of petroleum, and most of the equipment, which set back the German's oil supply considerably, right at the peak of war.

They also struggled to import the much-needed castor oil for their rotary engines due to the tight naval blockade by the British Royal Navy, which made operating these engines increasingly difficult and led to the creation of a substitute - Voltol - also known as Ersatz (German for substitute) oil. This war-time home-brew was a mixture of rapeseed and mineral oil produced by electrical cracking. The less-than-satisfactory castor oil knock-off was blamed for numerous engine failures in German-built Oberursel rotary engines.

As the war progressed, rotary engines fell from favour with the Luftstreitkräfte and, by 1917, many German engine manufacturers focused their attention on producing heavier six-cylinder inline water-cooled engines that could use conventional mineral-oil-based lubricants.

Now, back to the beans of war - castor oil was the natural choice for rotary engines with a total-loss lubrication system operating in the arduous conditions of war service. This fit-for-purpose lubricant bonded to the metal surfaces, could maintain a film under high loads and had a relatively stable viscosity over a wider temperature range when compared to mineral oils. Another property that made castor oil essential, was that it is immiscible with petrol, so it delivered lubrication at the same time as the fuel combusted. If mineral oil was used in this system, it would be diluted with the fuel and lose its lubricating properties.

However, the use of castor oil was not without its challenges. It had poor oxidation stability and the propensity for forming gum deposits under high-temperature operation, but thankfully this was not a serious issue with the total loss system.

A more troublesome issue was that it would congeal in very cold temperatures, and so it became common practice to thin out the oil by syringing kerosene into the cylinder head to keep the valves and piston rings from sticking. Another partial remedy was to heat up the castor oil (to above 50 ⁰C) and mix it with a small dose of a lighter mineral oil like Vacuum A Mobiloil - a basic SAE 30. According to RAF (Royal Air Force) historical society journals of British logistics on the Western Front, Cavalry Corps general service wagons carried Vacuum A oil for this very purpose, and for use in non-rotary engines.

A lesser-known fact about the use of castor oil in aero-engines during WWI was its effect on the pilots.

Ever wondered why WWI pilots wore white silk scarves? Sure, they certainly looked dashing with their scarves snapping in the wind, but this was an act born of necessity, not pretentious styling. Apart from being a symbol of distinction between different squadrons, silk scarves also prevented neck-chafing as the pilots twisted their necks while scanning the not-so-friendly skies for enemy aircraft.

However, there was another very good reason to don this accessory - running a rotary engine on castor oil in a total-loss lubrication system was a messy business.

After combustion, castor oil fumes were expelled out the exhaust valve and vented back over the plane and the pilot, who was sitting in an open cockpit. So, scarves were essential for wiping goggles clean of castor oil and any other muck that flew at the pilot's face. Cleaning goggles with an oily scarf would only make matters worse, so the choice of colour (white) was to make it easier to spot a soiled scarf before smudging one's goggles.

Another unfortunate side-effect was that these pilots often ingested a certain amount of the oil mist during flight, which had a, uhm, purgative effect, as castor oil is a rather strong laxative. According to Canadian flying ace, Air Commodore Duncan Bell-Irving, the reported antidote to this cathartic effect was a few shots of brandy before flight. Bottoms up!

Castor oil was the oil of choice for aircraft oils at the beginning of the aviation era, but these oils would be dropped in favour of mineral-based oils in the years to come.

The rapid development of aviation in the years after the Great War saw aircraft flying faster, further and higher, with the invention of more powerful engines. As engine performance increased, along with higher temperatures and pressure, there was an urgent need for lubricating oils specifically designed to meet the needs of aircraft engines.

By the end of WWI, it was clear to all - airplanes were the weapon of the future, and so the stage was set for World War II (WWII).

1918 CE

Prior to Arthur Gulborg's invention of the grease gun in 1918, a bearing was lubricated individually using a grease-cup device. The grease-cup, aptly named, resembled a large thimble-sized reservoir sitting above the bearing entry point. The grease-cup had a screw-in lid that, when removed, allowed grease to be manually paddled in place.

Working for the Alemite Die Casting company in Chicago, Gulborg was tasked with the tedious responsibility of relubricating the diecasting machines by refilling their oil cups several times a day.

Recognising an opportunity for increased efficiency, he set out to design the first-ever pressurised grease gun that could be directly coupled to the grease fitting, making the grease-cup obsolete. He named his design the ""Alemite High Pressure Grease System."" When it was adopted in 1918 as the greasing standard for the U.S. Army, the company made a fortune.

1919 CE

The American Petroleum Institute (API) has been setting the standards for lubricant quality since its inception, but actually traces its routes to the beginning of WWI, when the American congress and the domestic natural gas and oil industry worked together to help the war effort.

After the war, momentum began to build to form a national association that could represent the entire

industry in the postwar years. So, in 1919, the API was officially formed as a standard-setting organisation, and has since become a cornerstone for establishing and maintaining worldwide standards in the oil industry.

Following WWII, the API developed the first category designations for oils. The system was rudimentary in nature and designated oils for light, medium or severe service applications.

Around 1960, engine-sequence tests were introduced to measure specific performance parameters. By 1970, the designation system changed into the API categories still seen on oil containers today, with the characteristic ""S"" and ""C"" series to denote petrol and diesel-oil performance classifications, all neatly displayed in the API service symbol, or ""Donut"", as it would come to be known.

1923 CE

In 1923, the SAE revised their viscosity-classification system. They expanded the number of viscosity grades from the original six, to ten grades, to include gear oils. The new grades ranged from SAE 10 to SAE 90, with narrower viscosity intervals between each grade.

The specification numbers ranged from 20 to 115, and were based on the first two digits of the average Saybolt viscosity seconds (SUS). This allowed for a more accurate description of an oil's viscosity characteristics, and made it easier for consumers and manufacturers to select the appropriate oil for their specific needs.

As time passed and technology evolved, the industry came to realise that the existing grade specification did not adequately describe the cold-weather performance of existing engine oils. So, in the 1950s, the original set of viscosity grades was augmented with a set of winter ""W"" grade designations, which were specified by viscosity measured at 0° F.

Over the coming years, the SAE would go on to rename its oil classification systems to its current designation of SAE J300 and J306 for engine and gear oils, convert to the metric system, and add measurements for cold cranking, pumpability and High Temperature High Shear (HTHS) viscosity, bringing us to the present-day system.

1923 CE

Oil filters were not a standard feature in earlier car engines, but that was about to change, thanks to two gentlemen - Ernest Sweetland and George Greenhalgh - who, in 1923 patented the first automotive oil filtration system. They called their device ""Purolator"", short for ""pure oil later"".

The original Purolator featured an upright series of seven twill weave, cloth-covered, perforated plates encased in a heavy duty cast canister. It also had a sight-feed glass on one side, enabling the owner to see the oil flow and change the whole unit when the flow slowed to a trickle. Purolator would go on to patent the first pleated paper oil-filter element in 1946.

1925 CE

12 years after Friedrich Bergius produced synthetic oil from coal dust, two of his countrymen - Professor Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch - applied for a patent on a process to produce liquid hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide gas and hydrogen using metal catalysts. The hydrocarbons synthesised in this process were primarily composed of liquid alkanes (paraffins), but this process also produced other by-products like olefins, alcohols, and paraffin waxes.

Franz received several awards for his scientific contributions, including the prestigious Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1930.

Hans, unfortunately, did not receive any awards for his part in this collaboration, but could take solace in the fact that the process he helped to create would bear his name.

The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis remains a critical process in the production of synthetic fuels and chemicals today, especially in a climate of environmental sustainability, where industries are increasingly focused on reducing their dependence on fossil fuels.

1927 CE

By 1927 there were more than 27 million cars on the road worldwide, of which more than 15 million were Model T Fords. Petrol had replaced kerosene as the primary focus of the petroleum industry and, as the bustling automotive industry grew, so did the emphasis on developing improved lubricating oils to meet the needs of these vehicles.

The oil industry was quick to respond to the demand for higher-quality engine oils and over the next decade, numerous refining processes, like solvent extraction and vacuum distillation of crude oil, emerged as methods for improving lubricant performance.",engineeringnews.co.za,news,Engineering News,Dimpho Madiba,-0.1372549019607843,453978131,1,https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/template/en2016/images/en_default_large.jpg,

Targets 1.6 gigawatts of clean power once deployed

By Simon Jessop

LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Dubai-based private energy firm Alcazar Energy said it has raised $490 million for a second renewable energy fund backed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation as it looks to build out utility scale projects in emerging markets.

Alcazar Energy Partners II was also backed by Austria's development bank and several industrial groups, Co-Founder Daniel Calderon told Reuters, and ended just shy of a $500 million target despite a tough fund-raising environment.

The new backers join an existing group of leading investors including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and insurer Allianz, which signed up before the first close of the fund in 2022.

The second fund has already begun building a portfolio of assets in the western Balkans region, with two wind farms totalling 456 megawatts, part of fund strategy to develop over 1.6 gigawatts of clean energy across a range of markets.

Once operational, the fund's investments are set to mitigate 3 million tonnes a year of greenhouse gas emissions while generating enough electricity to power more than 300,000 households, Alcazar said.

The western Balkans is a particularly attractive as an investment destination as the region looks to wean itself off climate-damaging coal power and a reliance on fossil fuel imports from countries including Russia.

Economies not in the European Union are also being incentivised to cut their grid emissions to help exporters avoid taxes when they sell into the bloc, which is setting tougher rules based on the carbon content of some imports.

""If you reduce (use of fossil fuels) ... and make it heavier on wind and heavier on solar, then you're going to be helping the local economy in a big way,"" Calderon said. (Editing by Alison Williams)",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,0.411764705882353,453975811,1,,eng-9586282

Here's what we found,"Fact CheckPeter Dutton excoriated Labor in his budget reply while pumping up his own record. But did he stick to the facts?

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's budget reply speech painted a stark picture of the country's direction under the Albanese government.

Manufacturing insolvencies, bulk-billing rates, health spending and inflation were some of the issues Mr Dutton used to attack Labor's record and spruik his own from when he was last in government as a minister.

But how closely did he stick to the facts? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.

Mr Dutton lashed the government's energy policies, attempting to tie them to an uptick in manufacturing insolvencies since Labor was elected.

""If energy is not affordable or reliable, more manufacturers will shut up shop or move offshore. That's why there's been a threefold increase in the number of manufacturers who have closed their doors over the last two years,"" he said.

It's a similar claim to one made by Deputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley earlier this year -- which Fact Check found was not the full story.

At the time, insolvency figures released by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission showed there was indeed a threefold increase in the number of manufacturing insolvencies recorded in the first six months of 2023-24 compared to the same period in 2021-22, rising from 85 to 243.

Since Ms Ley made her claim, new data has been released. Manufacturing insolvencies have risen to 456 as of April 28 this year, which is around three times greater than the figure of 151 recorded in the 10 months to April in 2021.

But in highlighting these figures, Ms Ley and Mr Dutton failed to mention the effect of the pandemic and some of their own party's policies.

Experts told Fact Check that much of the recent increase was due to the ending of pandemic-related measures that were helping businesses remain open, including JobKeeper payments and temporary insolvency protections.

These had helped push the number of manufacturing insolvencies down to a decade low in the financial years 2020-21 and 2021-22.

Since then, the Australian Taxation Office has embarked on a large-scale operation to collect unpaid taxes. Meanwhile, interest rates have also risen from pandemic-era lows, increasing business borrowing costs.

Experts said the insolvency figures cited by Ms Ley should not be viewed in isolation, noting several other measures that could be used to gauge the health of the sector.

At the end of 2022-23 there were 90,174 operating manufacturing businesses in Australia, up from 89,529 a year earlier, for example. Meanwhile, capital expenditure in the industry increased by 18.3 per cent over the year to December 2023.

Suggesting that ""people's health and wellbeing are suffering"" under a cost-of-living crisis, Mr Dutton was also keen to contrast Labor's record on health with his own as health minister, a role he held briefly between September 2013 and December 2014.

When it came to free GP visits, for example, Mr Dutton claimed he had ""inherited a bulk-billing rate of 73 percent and increased it to 84 per cent"".

""When we left government, bulk-billing was 88.5 per cent,"" Mr Dutton went on. ""What Labor tried to hide in its budget is that bulk billing has decreased to 77 per cent -- an 11 per cent drop.""

Not all of his figures quite stack up, however.

According to statistics published by the Department of Health and Aged Care, when Mr Dutton became health minister the rate of GP attendances bulk-billed over the previous 12 months was 82.5 per cent, not 73 per cent as he claimed.

That means the bulk-billing rate rose 1.5 percentage points, to 84 per cent, during his time in the role -- far from the 11 percentage point increase he took credit for.

Still, Mr Dutton's more recent numbers check out.

The latest data, released last week, shows that in the year to March 2024, 77.3 per cent of GP attendances were bulk-billed compared with 88.5 per cent when Labor was elected in May 2022.

Importantly, as experts have previously explained to Fact Check, the bulk-billing rate refers to the number of services bulk-billed rather than the number of people who received them.

Medicare statistics on the proportion of people who are bulk-billed for GP visits (""always"", ""usually"", ""sometimes"" or ""never"") support Mr Dutton's broader point that the practice has decreased under Labor.

The data shows that in the year ending soon after Labor was elected, 2021-22, 65.8 per cent of people visiting the GP were always bulk-billed. A year later, that rate had fallen by 14.1 percentage points, to 51.7 per cent.

The proportion of patients never bulk-billed, meanwhile, rose by 6.3 percentage points, from 4.2 per cent to 10.5 per cent.

During Mr Dutton's time as health minister, the proportion of people always bulk-billed remained more stable, increasing from 61.1 per cent in 2012-13 to 62.4 per cent in 2013-14, and then to 63.7 per cent in 2014-15.

While the Albanese government has tripled incentives for doctors to bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders, GPs have called for more funding.

During his speech, Mr Dutton also spruiked his record on hospital funding, stating: ""As a health minister, I increased hospital funding year-on-year.""

Indeed, data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, adjusted for inflation and population growth, shows that recurrent funding on public hospitals increased during Mr Dutton's 15 month stint in the health portfolio.

In 2012-13, the last full year before the Coalition was elected, the federal government spent $846 per person on public hospitals. That figure increased to $852.3 in 2013-14 and to $883.3 in 2014-15.

In percentage terms, this equates to a 0.7 per cent increase from 2012-13 to 2013-14, and a 3.6 per cent increase the following year.

Experts previously told Fact Check that health funding typically increases year on year, with data showing just eight decreases in hospital funding during the nearly three decades before the Coalition came to power.

Notably, the spending figures don't capture the full picture of Mr Dutton's time as health minister, which included the Coalition's plans to introduce a $7 co-payment for GP visits and cut the Medicare rebate for shorter visits by $20.

Both measures were ultimately scrapped, though this ""barnacle clearing"" occurred in the final weeks of Mr Dutton's time in the portfolio and under his successor, Sussan Ley.

As for hospital funding, the Coalition's 2014-15 budget, handed down by then-prime minister Tony Abbott and treasurer Joe Hockey, represented a drop compared with projected funding under the previous Labor government.

Indeed, the budget papers stated that Commonwealth funding for hospitals had ""reduced the incentive for States to be more efficient and accountable for their spending and delivery of services"" and deemed such funding ""unaffordable"".

""This Budget reduces growth in Commonwealth funding of these sectors over the medium-term, generating momentum for longer-term reforms to be considered,"" the budget said.

Mr Dutton attacked the government over the cost of living, drawing unfavourable comparisons between Australia and other nations.

""On comparative inflation, Australia is worse than the US, Singapore, Germany, Spain, Japan, the Netherlands, Italy, South Korea, Canada, France, and the entire Euro area,"" he said.

Comparative data on inflation is published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an intergovernmental body whose 38 members are often used as a proxy for ""developed countries"".

Its quarterly data for March 2024 shows Australia's headline inflation rate, at 3.6 per cent over the preceding 12 months, is indeed above that of the OECD economies Mr Dutton mentioned.

(Singapore is not an OECD country and its data was not available from the organisation).

Another way to look at rising consumer prices is core inflation, a measure that removes food and energy price increases from the equation and one that Mr Dutton and Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor have previously used to criticise Labor.

According to the OECD, Australia's core inflation, at 3.8 per cent, is above the rates recorded by most of the countries Mr Dutton mentioned, but below the USA's.

And then there are other European countries that Mr Dutton did not mention, such as Sweden, Norway and Austria, which all fared worse than Australia on both measures.

Also absent from the comparison was the United Kingdom, which recorded higher headline and core inflation than Australia.

(The UK is a member of the OECD and the G7, which Mr Taylor has compared Australia with in the past.)

While Australia sits well below the OECD average, this figure is inflated by the inclusion of Türkiye, with runaway headline inflation of 66.8 per cent.

Looking at median values, the 37 other countries included in the data recorded lower headline inflation than Australia (3.1 per cent) but higher core inflation (4.1 per cent).

Mr Dutton also referred to Labor's oft-repeated pre-election pledge to reduce power bills.

""Electricity bills haven't gone down by $275 as was pledged on 97 occasions -- they've skyrocketed,"" he said, referring to this as a broken promise.

Before the election, Labor did make a promise to cut power pills for households by $275. However, Mr Dutton failed to mention that Labor also gave itself a deadline of 2025, meaning the pledge cannot be called broken yet.

Fact Check has deemed the promise to be stalled, due to a forecast spike in energy prices, since the 2022-23 budget.

The latest report from the ACCC's inquiry into the energy market shows the average annual cost to residential consumers was $1,434 in 2020-21, the most recent year for which data was available when Labor's modelling was prepared.

Expressed in 2020-21 dollars, the annual cost fell to $1,313 in 2021-22 before rising to $1,328 in 2022-23.

In other words, there has been a net decrease of $106 since 2020-21, with an increase of $15 since Labor came to office in May 2022.

In the latest budget, Labor announced a $300 energy bill rebate for every household and $325 for small businesses for the 2024-25 financial year, though the impact of these measures will not show up in the data for some time.",abc.net.au,news,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,,0.04313725490196085,453939601,1,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4c86335a79bbcaba74e83b461d2c3244?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,

All in all, this is good news for the climate. But many low- and middle-income people who used to travel around the EU will no longer be able to do so, or at least will be able to do so much less often.

Yet the same policies will have little or no impact on the use of much more polluting private jets, which typically cover distances served by commercial airlines and trains. This is a case of unfair sacrifice for climate action. Addressing this injustice should be a top priority for the next EU legislative term if a just and inclusive climate transition is to be achieved.

According to data from the European Commission, intra-EU airfares last summer were on average between 20% and 30% higher than they had been before COVID-19. The main reasons are high consumer demand, rising fuel costs and disrupted supply chains -- the latter two at least partly due to the geopolitical turmoil of recent years.

Prices are likely to rise further in the coming years as a result of three factors. First, the reform of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which is at the heart of the ""Fit For 55"" policy package proposed by the European Commission in summer 2021 and partially adopted in spring 2023.

Since 2012, intra-EU aviation emissions have been part of the EU ETS, the market-based system introduced by the EU in 2005 to cap emissions from certain EU sectors, notably energy-intensive industries, electricity generation and aviation. Like industry, aviation has so far benefited from free emission allowances -- until last year less than 20% of the aviation allowances were auctioned. Under the new ETS reform, free allowances will be phased out between 2024 and 2026. This means that airlines will have to bear not only the private cost of fuel, but also the social cost of their operations. While the EU ETS reform maintains free allowances for operators using less polluting fuels, these are more expensive than traditional fuels. In addition, the annual ETS emissions cap will be gradually reduced in the coming years, leading to an increase in the price of auctioned allowances (since 2021 the UK has its own ETS).

Second, the EU institutions are currently working on a reform of the 2003 Energy Taxation Directive (ETD). More specifically, the ETD was intended to introduce minimum levels of taxation on electricity and motor and heating fuels, both to avoid market distortions in the EU and to promote the decarbonization of these sectors. However, to date, both kerosene used by aircraft and heavy fuel oil used by the shipping industry have been exempted from taxation under the ETD. As part of the ""Fit for 55"" package, the European Commission had also proposed an update to the ETD, which is still awaiting adoption and which would, among other things, remove the above exemptions. Thirdly, some countries, and most notably France, defended the idea of a fixed minimum price for intra-EU flights. It remains to be seen whether these proposals will be adopted in the future.

According to Airlines for Europe, the EU's largest airline association, the cost to airlines of complying with the above EU norms will be 13 to 14 times higher in 2030 than in 2019. According to the research center SEO Amsterdam Economics, if these price increases are fully passed on to consumers, demand for flights will fall, leading to a reduction in intra-EU air traffic of more than 8% in 2030 and around 12% in 2035, compared to if such reforms had not been implemented.

Anyone concerned about climate change can breathe a sigh of relief. Rising ticket prices will reduce the number of air travelers and the frequency of flights. This is inevitable if the EU is to achieve its goal of zero net CO emissions within a few decades. In recent years, however, low-cost airlines have made it possible for people on low incomes to travel between EU countries -- something that was previously very uncommon. In a way, low-cost airlines have democratized travel, allowing poorer people to both build international experience and maintain affective and family ties (think of how many parents now have children studying or working in other EU countries, or how many couples live and work in different places). This is also because, as Greenpeace pointed out in a recent study, traveling by train in the EU is still significantly more expensive than flying.

You could say that these concerns are minor compared to the climate threat. Low-cost airlines have so far produced an inordinate amount of CO for purposes that are ultimately not about subsistence. However, if the climate threat justifies people on low incomes not traveling, or at least traveling much less than before, then it must also justify affluent EU travelers giving up private flights, which on average emit up to 14 times more CO per passenger than a scheduled flight, and using airlines or, better still, high-speed trains. The main problem with the EU's one-size-fits-all approach to climate policy is that many rich jet users will simply remain indifferent to the ongoing increases in the price of emissions permits.

Asking low-income people to give up something valuable to them -- travel -- for the collective good, while the rich continue to enjoy superfluous luxury, is the furthest thing from the fair and inclusive transition that the EU institutions have set as their goal. Moreover, the more the rich contribute to the increase of CO in the atmosphere with their luxury emissions, the greater the behavioral sacrifice that will have to be made by everyone else in order to keep global warming within more or less acceptable limits.

According to a recent study commissioned by Geenpeace from CE Delft, the number of private flights in Europe increased from just under 120,000 in 2020 to more than half a million in 2022. More than half of these flights are short to medium distance, comparable to the distance between Paris and Marseille (about 750 km), which in the vast majority of cases can be reasonably substituted by alternative means of transport. The top four routes for private flights in Europe are, in order, London-Paris (just over two hours by high-speed train), London-Nice (several scheduled flights per day), Paris-Geneva (just over three hours by high-speed train) and Paris-Nice (many scheduled flights or just over five hours by high-speed train).

A group of EU countries, namely Austria, the Netherlands, and France, recently wrote to the EU institutions calling for new regulations on the use of private jets (backed by Ireland and Belgium). The current EU Transport Commissioner has indicated that this will not happen, at least for now. Press reports suggest that the European Commission's approach is to legislate on aviation as a whole, rather than introducing specific rules for private jets.

Some EU countries are trying to fill this regulatory gap at EU level with national measures. France, for example, has discussed a ban on private flights (proposed by the left-wing coalition La France Insoumise (LFI) and supported by the Greens) and a super-tax on luxury flights (favored by Emmanuel Macron's centrist government). The Dutch airport Amsterdam Schiphol is planning to restrict access to private aircraft. Spain is considering a ban on short-term private flights as part of its plan to achieve net zero CO emissions by 2050. There is every reason for the next European Commission to take up the climate leadership baton from the current one and close the regulation loophole that private aviation currently enjoys. If there is to be ambitious and accelerated climate action, everyone, including the richest, should be part of it.",techxplore.com,news,Tech Xplore,,-0.05882352941176472,453917753,3,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/private-jet-1.jpg,

Join us in this fight.

The Austrian government will allocate 5 million euros (around $5.4 million) for energy infrastructure restoration in Ukraine, Der Standard reported on May 20, citing an Austrian official.

Moscow has recently intensified its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine's critical infrastructure, destroying several thermal power plants across the country. This included the Trypillia plant, the main electricity supplier to Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and Cherkasy oblasts.

Russia carried out a large-scale attack on May 8 against Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, and Vinnytsia oblasts, mainly targeting energy infrastructure. At least two hydroelectric power plants had to be decommissioned as a result of the attack.

Financing will be provided from the Climate Action and Energy Ministry's budget and distributed to Ukraine within the Energy Community, an international organization that aims to extend the EU internal energy market.

The allocated funds will be spent on urgently needed spare parts, generators, and repair lines, according to Der Standard.

""As a neutral country, Austria also must stand on the side of humanity in this war,"" Austrian Climate Action and Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler said.

Gewessler hopes that additional funds will ""at least facilitate the reconstruction somehow.""

The Ukrainian ambassador to Austria, Vasyl Khymynets, thanked the minister for a ""strong signal of solidarity.""

""This financial assistance from the federal government is critical to restore energy infrastructure and supply Ukrainian people with electricity amid Russian efforts to destroy the energy infrastructure with air strikes and artillery shelling,"" Khymynets said.

Ukraine's power generation capacity has decreased by up to 8 gigawatt hours (GWh) and needs nearly $1 billion to compensate, according to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.

Shmyhal previously said Ukraine has allocated over Hr 7.1 billion ($179.4 million) to restore its power grid after the recent Russian strikes.",kyivindependent.com,news,The Kyiv Independent,,-0.003921568627450966,453914952,5,https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1243178046.jpg,

They used synthetic quartz crystals to trap solar energy, generating intense heat.

This technology could hold the ability to replace fossil fuels in industries requiring high temperatures, like iron ore smelting and cement production.

""Our research showed that solar thermal trapping works not just at low temperatures, but well above 1,000 degrees Celsius,"" says Emiliano Casati of ETH Zurich. This advancement may lead to reducing emissions in heavy manufacturing.

The research team is now working on refining this technology. They are testing different materials, fluids, and gases, and exploring other forms of heat radiation.

Casati spoke about the importance of energy solutions, stating, ""Energy issue is a cornerstone to the survival of our society."" The aim is to make solar receivers more efficient for industrial processes that require high heat.

To encourage industry adoption, demonstrating the economic benefits of this technology on a large scale is essential. Casati adds, ""We need to show the economic viability and advantages of this technology at scale.""

The Prosecutor is seeking the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant as co-perpetrators of the war crime of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and, in association with the starvation campaign (para. 22):

The co-perpetration allegation is based on Netanyahu and Gallant's making essential contributions to a common plan to use starvation and other acts of violence against the Gazan civilian population as a means to eliminate Hamas and secure the return of hostages, as well as to inflict collective punishment. The Prosecutor also alleged the criminal liability of Netanyahu and Gallant under the doctrine of superior responsibility (more on what that means below).

The Prosecutor is seeking the arrest of Sinwar, Deif, and Haniyeh as co-perpetrators of the crimes against humanity of extermination, murder, torture, rape and other acts of sexual violence in the context of captivity, and other inhumane acts, and of the war crimes of taking hostages, murder, torture, cruel treatment, and rape and other acts of sexual violence in the context of captivity.

The co-perpetration allegation is based on Sinwar, Deif, and Haniyeh making essential contributions to a common plan to attack military bases in Israel, to attack and to kill civilians, and to take and detain hostages. The Prosecutor also alleges the liability of these Hamas leaders under the doctrine of superior responsibility and indicates that other modes of liability may be available.

This a remarkably comprehensive set of allegations and represents an unprecedented level of transparency at this stage of a case at the ICC. The request for warrants is supplemented by a Report authored by a Panel of Experts in International Law, convened by the ICC Prosecutor in January 2024. The Panel included: Adrian Fulford, Judge Theodor Meron, Amal Clooney, Danny Friedman, Baroness Helena Kennedy, and Elizabeth Wilmshurst. It was supported by two academic advisers: Marko Milanovic and Sandesh Sivakumaran. The Panel's conclusions were reached unanimously.

Building on Douglas Guilfoyle's excellent analysis for Articles of War when rumors of imminent warrants began to circulate, this article explains the legal process, legal grounds, and greater significance of today's announcement.

Summary of key points:

The ""reasonable grounds"" standard: For the ICC to issue an arrest warrant (or, where cooperation is anticipated, a summons to appear), the Prosecutor must convince a Pre-Trial Chamber that there are reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the Court's jurisdiction have been committed (article 58). The reasonable grounds to believe threshold is lower than the ""substantial grounds to believe"" necessary to have charges confirmed and go to trial (for which the Prosecutor will require further Pre-Trial Chamber approval) and it is far lower than the ""beyond reasonable doubt"" threshold necessary to secure a conviction (articles 61, 66). It can be established with a concise statement of the facts alleged to constitute the crimes and a summary of the evidence and other information supporting the reasonable belief that the identified individual is criminally responsible for the identified crimes. That does not mean that it is a foregone conclusion. In the case of a militia leader in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sylvestre Mudacumura, a Pre-Trial Chamber initially rejected the prosecutor's application for an arrest warrant (but issued a warrant on a subsequent application); and in the al-Bashir case, one of the alleged crimes was approved only on appeal.

Level of disclosure: To enhance the likelihood of arrest or to ensure the safety of victims and witnesses and to safeguard the investigation, an arrest warrant may be requested and issued under seal. This may extend to keeping the very existence of the warrant under seal until the time of arrest, as has been done in some cases involving members of rebel groups (e.g. here). Or it may entail keeping the details of the warrant under seal, while announcing its existence (e.g. here). It can also entail keeping the full content of the warrant secret, while including details regarding the individual and crime(s) implicated (e.g. here and here). At the other end of the spectrum, the Court can publish the full arrest warrant decision (e.g. here).

Today's announcement of applications for warrants against senior Israeli officials and Hamas leaders, particularly when read in conjunction with the Expert Panel Report, is extraordinarily detailed in its specification of persons, crimes, and legal reasoning.

There may be more requests and warrants: It would be a mistake to presume that these are the only warrants that will be requested in the Palestine situation. Further warrant applications could add additional persons, expand the list of alleged crimes, or both (for an example of expanding the list of alleged crimes against an already-identified person, see here). In particular, the Prosecutor's statement notes that his investigations continue into reports of sexual violence committed on October 7 (as distinct from in the context of captivity, as is alleged in today's warrant applications) and in relation to the large-scale IDF bombing campaign in Gaza (as distinct from the siege deprivation that is alleged in today's warrant applications).

There are three alternative grounds for ICC jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide:

The last of these is inconceivable in the current context, given the United States' veto. However, each of the other two alternative grounds is directly applicable and important in the current context.

Palestine acceded to the ICC Statute on Jan. 2, 2015, causing the Statute to enter into force for Palestine on April 1, 2015. At the same time, it issued an article 12(3) declaration, accepting ICC jurisdiction going back to June 13, 2014.

As such from June 13, 2014, the ICC has jurisdiction over crimes in the ICC Statute:

Based on current ICC case law, territorial jurisdiction can attach if any part of the crime (including its consequences) occurs on State Party territory, even if the perpetrator acts entirely from the territory of a non-party (ICC Myanmar Authorization 2019, paras. 56-61). That means, under existing ICC precedent, conduct by Israeli officials the consequences of which occur in Palestinian territory are within the Court's jurisdiction.

Israel, the United States, and a handful of other States, have objected to the validity of Palestine's ICC accession, citing questions regarding Palestinian statehood (here, here, and here, paras. 27, 100-101). Recognizing the ""complex legal and factual issues"" at stake, on Jan. 22, 2020, the previous head Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda requested an opinion from the Court's Pre-Trial Chamber regarding jurisdiction in the context of Palestine, so that she could determine whether, and on what terms, to open a full investigation.

On Feb. 5, 2021, Pre-Trial Chamber I issued its decision on that question. Although avoiding a general finding on the question of statehood, it determined (paras. 89-131):

To be clear, this determination could still be contested. The Pre-Trial Chamber stipulated (para. 131) that its ""conclusions pertain to the current stage of the proceedings, namely the initiation of an investigation ... When the Prosecutor submits an application for the issuance of a warrant of arrest or summons to appear under article 58 of the Statute ... the Chamber will be in a position to examine further questions of jurisdiction which may arise at that point in time.""

However, a challenge to the Court's jurisdiction on that basis is unlikely to succeed. The argument that Palestine is not an ICC State Party is today even weaker than it was when it was rejected by the Pre-Trial Chamber in 2021. Most obviously, less than two weeks ago, 143 member states voted in favor of the United Nations General Assembly resolution on Admission of new Members to the United Nations, which, among other things determined: ""the State of Palestine is qualified for membership in the United Nations in accordance with Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations and should therefore be admitted to membership in the United Nations."" Article 4 of the Charter limits U.N. membership to states. The affirmative vote included five more states than had voted for the General Assembly's 2012 resolution recognizing Palestine as a non-member observer state. Only eight States stood with Israel in voting against the most recent resolution.

Moreover, Canada, which had voted against the 2012 resolution and which was the only ICC State Party to contest the validity of Palestine's accession to the Statute at the time in 2015 (para. 100), abstained from the most recent General Assembly vote and has reversed its opposition to ICC jurisdiction. The United Kingdom also appears to have withdrawn its opposition to ICC jurisdiction over the Palestine situation. Others that objected to ICC jurisdiction in the lead-up to the ICC's 2021 decision voted in favor of Palestinian statehood in the recent U.N. vote (although Uganda and Brazil had also approved Palestine's status as non-member observer state in 2012).

Neither occupation nor unlawful annexation affects the scope of the territorial jurisdiction that a State may grant the ICC. For example, pursuant to Ukraine's consent, the ICC has jurisdiction over areas of Ukraine occupied and illegally annexed by Russia. Indeed, the Court's arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin is predicated on action in occupied Ukraine (land that the current Russian government does not recognize as Ukrainian).

The Pre-Trial Chamber in 2021 determined that the Court's territorial jurisdiction includes the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Gaza (para. 118), and did so citing General Assembly and Security Council resolutions recognizing the territory occupied since the 1967 war to be occupied Palestinian territory. The arrest warrants issued today relate to activity occurring in whole or in part in Gaza. There is no credible basis for disputing that Gaza is Palestinian territory.

It should also be noted that any objection to ICC jurisdiction on the basis of a rejection of Palestinian statehood would apply equally to the viability of warrants against Hamas leaders as to the viability of warrants against Israeli officials. As explained above, both are predicated on Palestine's status as an ICC State Party.

The ICC is a court of last resort. By design, it is supposed to complement and encourage national proceedings, stepping in only to fill a lack of credible investigations and prosecutions at the domestic level. However, although there are reports of Israeli criminal investigations relating to conduct in Gaza, there is no public indication of any investigations of Netanyahu or Gallant for starvation crimes. On the contrary, Israel has repeatedly denied any practice or policy of sustenance denial or willful impediment of humanitarian relief. Such denials have also been an important component of its argument at the International Court of Justice.

If, contrary to this inference, there are domestic investigations relating to Netanyahu or Gallant for starvation crimes, Israel or the relevant individual can issue a challenge to the admissibility of the case and have the question reviewed by the judges of the Pre-Trial Chamber (article 19(2)).

Such a challenge would be assessed pursuant to the principle of complementarity, which is built into the ICC statute as a safeguard that ensures the primacy of domestic jurisdiction (article 17). This mechanism provides that a case is not admissible if the person identified in the arrest warrant has been or is being investigated or tried domestically for substantially the same conduct under scrutiny at the ICC (ICC Appeal of Kenya 2011, paras. 33-46). In the absence of such action, or if the domestic scrutiny relates to substantially different conduct, the case is admissible at the ICC.

Even if domestic investigations are underway, the ICC case may proceed if the domestic investigations are not consistent with a genuine effort to bring the person to justice (e.g. if they are sham proceedings designed to shield the individual from accountability) (article 17(2)). On that point, it is important to pay attention to the rigor and nature of Israel's existing domestic investigations (an issue that is currently drawing some scrutiny).

As noted above, today's warrant applications are unlikely to be the last associated with the Palestine situation. However, there are strong reasons why the Prosecutor is starting with starvation crimes: the clarity of the crime base, the degree to which it can be linked to those at the top, and the OTP's case-selection criteria of gravity, elevating underrepresented crimes, and potential impact.

It is often complicated to prove crimes arising during fighting due to the difficulty of determining or evaluating:

For reasons discussed below, key factual components of starvation crimes are relatively clear in the current context, and the relevant actions have been underway (albeit in varying forms) from the beginning. The Prosecutor has repeatedly warned of his attention to the criminality of that conduct and of the imperative to reverse it. Although applying a different legal framework (that of the Genocide Convention), the International Court of Justice has similarly placed great weight on this issue.

Of course, the crime base involving detainee mistreatment, wanton destruction, or pillage may be even clearer-cut in the current context, due to insider witness testimony and IDF troops posting footage of such acts on social media (e.g. here and here). However, although the recordings of lower-level IDF troops engaged in wanton destruction or pillage in Gaza offer powerful evidence of their criminal culpability, the viability of holding senior leaders accountable for such acts is contingent on finding ""linkage evidence"" connecting them to the conduct on the ground and perhaps theories of command responsibility.

The connections are simply clearer in the case of starvation carried out as a matter of policy. Senior leaders were explicit from early on about the sustenance denial strategy and their roles in it. Among those listed today, Defense Minister Gallant announced on Oct. 9, 2023, ""I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly."" Ten days later Prime Minister Netanyahu stated, ""we will not allow humanitarian assistance, in the form of food and medicines, from our territory to the Gaza Strip."" Other ministers have, at various points, articulated a deliberate policy of sustenance denial or openly blocked the delivery of food. Moreover, the conflict-wide structure of decisions about humanitarian access (requiring coordination at the top level of government) and the continuing nature of the crime (diminishing the plausibility of any lack of awareness among senior commanders as the situation deteriorated) both facilitate proving high-level responsibility for this crime.

Beyond questions of case viability, the OTP has previously identified a number of factors that inform its decisions on case selection. Among those factors, three weigh heavily in favor of starvation charges here:

There are three components to the crime worth discussing here: the connection to an international armed conflict, the prohibited conduct, and intent (ICC Elements of Crimes, p.21). On the question of intent, it is also worth clarifying the relationship between the starvation prohibition and the protection of civilians.

Armed Conflict

As with all war crimes, starvation of civilians as a method of warfare applies only if there is an armed conflict, the perpetrator is aware of the facts that establish that armed conflict, and the action in question is shaped by or dependent upon the fact of the armed conflict (a nexus requirement). Moreover, in the context of Palestine, the starvation war crime applies only if the conflict qualifies as an international armed conflict, because Palestine has not ratified the 2019 amendment that extended the starvation war crime to non-international armed conflicts.

With the support of the Expert Panel (para. 13) Prosecutor has assessed (correctly) that this is not an obstacle in the current context, as Israel is bound by the law of international armed conflict in its operations in Gaza for two independent reasons:

Notably, despite holding that Israel ceased to be the occupying power following its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, the Israeli courts have referred to the law of international armed conflict in analyzing the situation in Gaza since that time, including with reference to the starvation prohibition (Jaber Al-Bassiouni Ahmed 2008, paras. 13-15). The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that it applies the law of both international and non-international armed conflict at least as a matter of policy.

There is no element that requires proving a consequence of these actions. That is, the Prosecutor does not need to prove that civilians starved as a result of the prohibited deprivation.

The deprivation of objects indispensable to civilian survival can take many forms, and has taken many forms in Gaza. It includes:

The precise forms of deprivation have varied over time and have been most severe in their application to, and effects on, the population of northern Gaza. The key question at the ICC is whether these acts of deprivation have combined with criminal intent.

Intent

Today's announcement indicates the Prosecutor has collected evidence ""including interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses, authenticated video, photo and audio material, satellite imagery and statements from the alleged perpetrator group,"" which shows:

that Israel has intentionally and systematically deprived the civilian population in all parts of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival.

This occurred through the imposition of a total siege over Gaza that involved completely closing the three border crossing points, Rafah, Kerem Shalom and Erez, from 8 October 2023 for extended periods and then by arbitrarily restricting the transfer of essential supplies - including food and medicine - through the border crossings after they were reopened. The siege also included cutting off cross-border water pipelines from Israel to Gaza - Gazans' principal source of clean water - for a prolonged period beginning 9 October 2023, and cutting off and hindering electricity supplies from at least 8 October 2023 until today. This took place alongside other attacks on civilians, including those queuing for food; obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian agencies; and attacks on and killing of aid workers, which forced many agencies to cease or limit their operations in Gaza.

Importantly, the Prosecutor ""submits that these acts were committed as part of a common plan to use starvation as a method of war and other acts of violence against the Gazan civilian population as a means to (i) eliminate Hamas; (ii) secure the return of the hostages which Hamas has abducted, and (iii) collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza, whom they perceived as a threat to Israel.""

In my view, this gets the question of intent broadly correct.

To be sure, given the lack of case law on the starvation crime, the meaning of intent in this context will be litigated as the case goes forward. I have outlined the range of arguments on that point at length in a law review article and in a Just Security essay. However, based on a composite analysis of (a) the underlying international humanitarian law on starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, as articulated in article 54 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, and (b) ""intent,"" as defined in article 30 of the ICC Statute, my view, which I have elaborated in the pieces linked above, is that acting with the intent to starve civilians as a method of warfare includes either of the two following alternatives:

or:

In my view, Defense Minister Gallant's initial announcement of the total siege clearly implicated the first of these, as the specific identification of food and water as items to be cut off could not be understood as anything other than a policy of purposive sustenance denial.

He was not alone in adopting this posture. By way of example, the day after Defense Minister Gallant's statement, another military official within the chain of command, Coordinator of the Government in the Territories Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian made a video recorded announcement: ""Hamas became ISIS, and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human beasts are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza - no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell - you will get hell.""

Subsequently, as the consensus of independent authorities has identified famine as setting in in northern Gaza and catastrophic food insecurity proliferating elsewhere in Gaza, it has become increasingly clear that acts of deprivation today (such as destroying agricultural land or impeding humanitarian relief) are virtually certain to contribute to civilian starvation. The situation is dire. This has been a predictable and predicted trajectory.

Civilians

Two points bear emphasis when considering what it means to intentionally starve civilians as a method of warfare:

Each of the additional allegations against Netanyahu and Gallant is associated with the practice of deprivation. In that sense, the facts discussed above are the core of today's applications for the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant. I have examined the way in which starvation charges can be brought under the crimes against humanity categories alleged by the Prosecutor (extermination, murder, other inhumane acts, and persecution) here. Rather than offering a full analysis of each of the criminal categories here, five points are worth emphasizing:

It is entirely appropriate and unsurprising that today's announcement also includes a request for arrest warrants against Hamas leaders. As noted above, ICC jurisdiction covers Statute crimes perpetrated by Palestinian nationals, even when the crimes occurred on Israeli territory. There is little doubt that Hamas militants and leaders have committed crimes within the ICC's jurisdiction on and since October 7. The Prosecutor has been clear from early on he was committed to investigating those crimes.

Hostage-Taking

The most widely predicted among the allegations against Hamas leaders was the war crime of hostage-taking (ICC Elements of Crimes, pp.12, 23). It involves the following elements:

It is clear that most, if not all, of the at least 245 hostages seized and detained on October 7 were civilians, including children and the elderly. Given that the attack as a whole was directed against a civilian population, the factual circumstances establishing their civilian status were surely clear to all involved in the assault.

On the issue of the intention to compel another to act or refrain from acting, the criminality of this practice does not turn on whether the target of the coercion has an independent legal obligation to perform the demanded act. It applies as clearly to the taking of hostages to demand compliance with the law as it does to the taking of hostages to demand any other act or omission. This is because the wrong inheres not in the nature of the demand, but in the unlawful instrumentalization of the hostages' liberty or safety. It is clear that the threat and reality of the hostages' continued detention has been used by Hamas leaders and negotiators as a point of leverage to compel Israel to act or refrain from acting in various ways (including, most obviously, agreeing to a ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid in, and releasing Palestinian detainees).

Other Crimes

In addition to hostage-taking, the other Hamas crimes alleged today are extremely likely to pass the arrest warrant threshold of ""reasonable grounds to believe."" These include: extermination, murder, torture, outrages upon personal dignity, inhumane acts, and crimes of sexual violence including rape. As noted above, today's application includes rape and other forms of sexual violence committed against hostages, while the Prosecutor notes in his contemporaneous public statement that his office ""continues to investigate reports of sexual violence committed on 7 October."" As exemplified by the sequence of warrants in the Ukraine situation, crimes for which it is more difficult to gather evidence and to prove intent of senior level officials may take longer to investigate, with warrants requested and issued later as a result. Today's warrant requests are unlikely to be the last.

As with the analysis of crimes against humanity in the context of Israel's siege of Gaza, it is clear that the attacks of October 7 were both widespread and systematic and that they were executed pursuant to an organizational policy, as exemplified by senior Hamas member Ghazi Hamad's threat to repeat the attack. With approximately 1,200 persons killed, the crimes against humanity of murder and extermination are likely to be clearly surpassed. As above, it is critical to bear in mind both (i) that a population composed predominantly of civilians does not lose its civilian character in virtue of the presence of combatants, and (ii) that an attack perpetrated without distinction against both civilians and combatants can qualify as an attack directed against civilians. The populations against which the assault of October 7 was perpetrated were civilian populations. That assessment is not changed by the presence of combatants within those populations.

Similarly, UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramilla Patten had already reported (e.g. para. 17) ""clear and convinceing evidence"" of the gross mistreatment of hostages, including on a level that would amount to torture (the ""infliction severe physical or mental pain or suffering"" ICC Elements of Crimes, p.5), outrages upon human dignity, inhumane acts, and rape and other forms of sexual violence.

The announcement indicates that both sets of applications include (but are not dependent on) the doctrine of command responsibility. Although not without its own difficulties at the ICC, this doctrine can overcome some of the challenges associated with linking leaders to conduct on the ground. Applied to military commanders, or those effectively acting as military commanders, its key elements (article 28) are:

As these elements emphasize, it is a crime of omission (the failure to take necessary and reasonable measures) and liability can attach on the basis of constructive knowledge (i.e. when the commander ""should have known"" about the criminality of their subordinates' conduct). The justification for this is the fact of the commander's effective control and the heightened responsibility that comes with it. Civilian leaders may also be held liable under this doctrine, but the second element concerning their state of knowledge includes a higher threshold for prosecutors to meet (the person ""either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated"" that subordinates were committing or about to commit the crimes). Additionally, in the context of civilian superiors, it must be shown that the crimes concerned activities that were themselves ""within the effective responsibility and control of the superior.""

Here, it seems likely that each of the persons listed in today's allegations will satisfy the effective control criterion. As such, their liability under command responsibility will turn on how much information they each had about the relevant crimes and whether any of them took measures to prevent, repress, or punish them. The level of knowledge and contribution alleged goes far beyond what is necessary to surpass those thresholds.

The ICC does not have its own police force, so the enforcement of any warrants that are issued will not be automatic. Israel is not party to the Statute and has made it abundantly clear it will not cooperate with the Court, at least not under anything like current political conditions. In that sense, it is unlikely that any of the identified individuals will be sitting in the dock in The Hague in the short or medium term.

However, as evinced by Netanyahu's significant expenditure of effort and political capital to try to stop their request or issuance, the warrants' approval would matter in multiple other respects. Warrants would change how the identified individuals can engage with the world, provide a focal point for various forms of political and legal mobilization (including in the United States and including against supplying military aid to Israel), and impact the standing of the ICC for different audiences.

A Shrinking World

First, if issued, warrants will change the terms on which Netanyahu and Gallant can engage with the world. If the warrants are approved by ICC judges, the 124 states that are party to the ICC Statute will have a legal obligation to arrest them if they come within the jurisdiction of those states (articles 89, 92). Civil society actors and others within some of those 124 states are likely to pursue various avenues to ensure that the warrants are domesticated, immediately actionable upon those individuals' entry into the relevant state's territory, and insulated from political interference. The Democratic Alliance succeeded in doing precisely this in the Pretoria High Court in order to incorporate the ICC's arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin into South African law -- an action that precipitated Putin's non-attendance at the BRICS Summit in August 2023, despite the fact that Putin had wanted to attend and South Africa had been reluctant to disinvite him.

While he remains in office, Netanyahu's status as head of government might be thought to complicate this analysis. However, the ICC Appeals Chamber has ruled (in proceedings relating to the warrant for former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir) that the ICC's status as an ""international court"" means that sitting heads of state or government of even states that are not party to the ICC Statute do not enjoy immunity before the Court or against states executing warrants on its behalf (Jordan Referral, Appeal Judgment 2019, paras. 100-117). Of course, al-Bashir's warrant arose from a situation referred by the UN Security Council, which provided the Court an independent and alternative basis for finding his immunity to be inapplicable (Jordan Referral, Appeal Judgment 2019, paras. 118-120, 133-149). There may be an effort to emphasize the latter theory over the former in cases not operating on the basis of a Security Council referral. However, in relying in the first instance on its status as an international court, the Appeals Chamber in the al-Bashir litigation set a precedent that would appear to be as applicable to Putin or Netanyahu as it was to al-Bashir (Jordan Referral, Appeal Judgment 2019, paras. 117-120).

In short, if the Prosecutor's request is successful, the world of Netanyahu and Gallant will shrink considerably. To travel to an ICC State Party would be, for them, to risk arrest and transfer to The Hague. This includes numerous States friendly to Israel, such as Germany, Austria, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Even for States that are not party to the ICC Statute, the domestic and international political cost of embracing and honoring these individuals has escalated meaningfully.

The impact will not be temporary. War crimes have no statute of limitations. Perpetrators, including former Heads of State, are sometimes tried multiple decades after their wrongful acts (e.g. here). Moreover, although the ICC has yet to rule definitively on the issue (Prosecutor v. Gaddafi, Admissibility Appeal Decision, para. 96), they are crimes for which there is generally thought to be no valid amnesty. In other words, the warrants are poised to hang over Netanyahu and Gallant until they are addressed. At most, the U.N. Security Council can defer a case for a year at a time, but each such deferral requires nine affirmative votes and no veto (article 16). That is not a realistic proposition as things stand, although it is not inconceivable that such a path could be included as part of the final and comprehensive negotiation of a two-state solution.

In addition to the direct impact on those listed in the warrant requests announced today, this legal development also sends a signal to other officials implicated in meaningful ways in the relevant government practices. Unless the situation changes, their worlds are also at risk of being permanently narrowed. Indeed, they cannot rule out the possibility of an existing or forthcoming sealed arrest warrant in anticipation of when they travel.

All of the same State Party obligations would attach if the Hamas warrants are approved. However, Hamas leaders already operate in a small world in terms of States to which they can safely travel, so the warrants would change less for them. At the same time, it is easier to imagine that they might be arrested and transferred in the short to medium term.

Focal Points for Political and Legal Mobilization

Beyond the immediate impact on the identified individuals, Pre-Trial Chamber approval of the Prosecutor's request would provide a potent focal point for political mobilization in various fora and in divergent directions.

Most obviously, the existence of warrants for the arrest of Netanyahu and Gallant would strengthen those mobilizing and litigating against military aid to Israel, while making it materially harder to defend the continuation of such support in the political arena and some courts of law. Although the ICC Prosecutor is unlikely to focus on those supplying arms, clarifying the criminal significance of what is being supported, which today's action does, may also heighten the legal exposure of those in positions to authorize or decline military aid.

In some quarters, today's requests will be invoked as evidence of bias and used to stoke pre-existing hostility toward the ICC and other international bodies. Pressure on the Prosecutor, his staff, and the Pre-Trial Chamber's judges may escalate. The Prosecutor responded admirably on that front before the Security Council last week on matters involving Ukraine, but he should not need to stand alone. States Parties and other States must express their solidarity and support in the face of efforts to intimidate, coerce, or punish ICC officials.

The Prosecutor made this point clear in his statement:

It is critical in this moment that my Office and all parts of the Court, including its independent judges, are permitted to conduct their work with full independence and impartiality. I insist that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence the officials of this Court must cease immediately. My Office will not hesitate to act pursuant to article 70 of the Rome Statute if such conduct continues.

One can choose not to agree with the Prosecutor's decision, but attacks on the independence of his office and on the judicial body are unacceptable.

The United States

Although the United States is not one of the 124 States with ICC Statute obligation to arrest and transfer Netanyahu and Gallant to the ICC, the warrants matter here, too.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is accused of perpetrating war crimes on the territory of another State (Ukraine) the existence and territorial boundaries of which he disputes. He is the head of State of a country that is not party to the ICC. The validity of the ICC's warrant against him - a warrant welcomed by the United States - is rooted in the validity of Ukraine's sovereign consent and the ICC's status as an international court. Although the precise legal arguments regarding ICC jurisdiction may be different, the parallels with the Prosecutor's request for warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant are clear, the core concerns for accountability should be no less, and confidence in the ICC as a court capable of reviewing the legal arguments fairly and impartially ought to be precisely the same. And yet the response from Washington is sure to be very different. Although unsurprising, this double standard on the part of the United States government is not politically costless. With each instance, the viability of mobilizing support around an invocation of the ""rules-based order"" - a key rallying cry in the effort to support Ukraine and other U.S. interests - diminishes.

As with other third States, the United States is one in which the warrants have the potential to strengthen those mobilizing politically against military aid to Israel and to weaken the political position of those seeking to maintain that contribution. These effects may impact the dynamics among lawyers in the State Department and elsewhere in the executive branch as much as they reverberate through public pressure and congressional deliberations.

At the same time, some in the United States are likely to escalate the rhetorical and other actions that already began with the first rumors that warrants might be forthcoming. As the OTP noted recently, such efforts may implicate article 70(1)(d) of the Statute, which includes among the ICC's ""offenses against the administration of justice"" the crime of ""impeding, intimidating or corruptly influencing an official of the Court for the purpose of forcing or persuading the official not to perform, or to perform improperly, his or her duties.""

The Court's jurisdiction over crimes involving interference with the administration of justice are broadly applicable. Specifically, the ICC's Rules of Procedure and Evidence appear not to apply the same requirement for territorial or nationality-based jurisdiction to offenses under article 70 as are applied to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide (ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence, rule 163(2)). However, even if that point were challenged, intimidation and impediments inflicted on Court officials acting on the territory of the Netherlands (the seat of the Court) could implicate territorial jurisdiction on the grounds that the Netherlands is an ICC State Party (ICC Myanmar Authorization 2019, paras. 56-61), at least insofar as the individuals in question are not shielded by an applicable immunity. There are many political reasons that the Prosecutor may be reluctant to pursue such action, but that analysis may turn on how egregious the efforts become. See also Uzay Yasar Aysev's analysis and Sergey Vasiliev's analysis of this issue as applied to sanctions and other efforts to intimidate ICC officials during the Trump administration.

A final note on U.S. legal obligations: given the inclusion of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions or serious violations of Common Article 3 (wilfully causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or health, wilful killing, cruel treatment, and murder), the allegations include crimes that could be prosecuted in the United States under domestic war crimes legislation. For acts falling within the former category, as a party to the Geneva Conventions, the United States has an obligation either to ""search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts"" or to extradite persons suspected of such crimes to a High Contracting Party that has made a prima facie case (Geneva Convention IV, article 146).

ICC Legitimacy

The arrest warrant requests matter also for the legitimacy of the International Criminal Court and its Prosecutor. Prior to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, the Court had suffered a decade of deepening crisis, with multiple points of deep disagreement between the Court and the African Union, overt non-cooperation, State Party withdrawals, and a budget crunch. Two decades into the Court's existence, these are the first ICC warrants issued against the officials of a country strongly allied with and supported by powerful Western states. These warrants alone will not dispel all criticisms of bias and inequity in the functioning of the ICC and its agents. Nor will they be sufficient to fully revive the Court's legitimacy within the constituencies where it has suffered most. However, the warrants may enhance the Court's standing in many quarters of the world, including among those who call for impartiality and the equal application of justice. For the Prosecutor to have failed to act in the face of the devastating man-made catastrophe that has been inflicted upon the people of Gaza would very likely have sealed the ICC's fate. Equally, given the gravity of the atrocities of October 7, it would have been untenable for the Prosecutor not to have sought the arrest of those responsible for the crimes that were perpetrated during that attack and that have continued since.",justsecurity.org,news,Just Security,,-0.5137254901960784,453911087,5,https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1986004821.jpg,eng-9583634

But many low- and middle-income people who used to travel around the EU will no longer be able to do so, or at least will be able to do so much less often. Yet the same policies will have little or no impact on the use of much more polluting private jets, which typically cover distances served by commercial airlines and trains. This is a case of unfair sacrifice for climate action. Addressing this injustice should be a top priority for the next EU legislative term if a just and inclusive climate transition is to be achieved.

Rising prices...

According to data from the European Commission, intra-EU airfares last summer were on average between 20% and 30% higher than they had been before Covid-19. The main reasons are high consumer demand, rising fuel costs and disrupted supply chains - the latter two at least partly due to the geopolitical turmoil of recent years.

Prices are likely to rise further in the coming years as a result of three factors. First, the reform of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which is at the heart of the ""Fit For 55"" policy package proposed by the European Commission in summer 2021 and partially adopted in spring 2023.

Since 2012, intra-EU aviation emissions have been part of the EU ETS, the market-based system introduced by the EU in 2005 to cap emissions from certain EU sectors, notably energy-intensive industries, electricity generation and aviation. Like industry, aviation has so far benefited from free emission allowances - until last year less than 20% of the aviation allowances were auctioned. Under the new ETS reform, free allowances will be phased out between 2024 and 2026. This means that airlines will have to bear not only the private cost of fuel, but also the social cost of their operations. While the EU ETS reform maintains free allowances for operators using less polluting fuels, these are more expensive than traditional fuels. In addition, the annual ETS emissions cap will be gradually reduced in the coming years, leading to an increase in the price of auctioned allowances (since 2021 the UK has its own ETS).

Second, the EU institutions are currently working on a reform of the 2003 Energy Taxation Directive (ETD). More specifically, the ETD was intended to introduce minimum levels of taxation on electricity and motor and heating fuels, both to avoid market distortions in the EU and to promote the decarbonisation of these sectors. However, to date, both kerosene used by aircraft and heavy fuel oil used by the shipping industry have been exempted from taxation under the ETD. As part of the ""Fit for 55"" package, the European Commission had also proposed an update to the ETD, which is still awaiting adoption and which would, among other things, remove the above exemptions. Thirdly, some countries, and most notably France, defended the idea of a fixed minimum price for intra-EU flights. It remains to be seen whether these proposals will be adopted in the future.

... and plummeting demand

According to Airlines for Europe, the EU's largest airline association, the cost to airlines of complying with the above EU norms will be 13 to 14 times higher in 2030 than in 2019. According to the research centre SEO Amsterdam Economics, if these price increases are fully passed on to consumers, demand for flights will fall, leading to a reduction in intra-EU air traffic of more than 8% in 2030 and around 12% in 2035, compared to if such reforms had not been implemented.

Anyone concerned about climate change can breathe a sigh of relief. Rising ticket prices will reduce the number of air travellers and the frequency of flights. This is inevitable if the EU is to achieve its goal of zero net CO2 emissions within a few decades. In recent years, however, low-cost airlines have made it possible for people on low incomes to travel between EU countries - something that was previously very uncommon. In a way, low-cost airlines have democratised travel, allowing poorer people to both build international experience and maintain affective and family ties (think of how many parents now have children studying or working in other EU countries, or how many couples live and work in different places). This is also because, as Greenpeace pointed out in a recent study, travelling by train in the EU is still significantly more expensive than flying.

An unjust transition

You could say that these concerns are minor compared to the climate threat. Low-cost airlines have so far produced an inordinate amount of CO2 for purposes that are ultimately not about subsistence. However, if the climate threat justifies people on low incomes not travelling, or at least travelling much less than before, then it must also justify affluent EU travellers giving up private flights, which on average emit up to 14 times more CO2 per passenger than a scheduled flight, and using airlines or, better still, high-speed trains. The main problem with the EU's one-size-fits-all approach to climate policy is that many rich jet users will simply remain indifferent to the ongoing increases in the price of emissions permits.

Asking low-income people to give up something valuable to them - travel - for the collective good, while the rich continue to enjoy superfluous luxury, is the furthest thing from the fair and inclusive transition that the EU institutions have set as their goal. Moreover, the more the rich contribute to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere with their luxury emissions, the greater the behavioural sacrifice that will have to be made by everyone else in order to keep global warming within more or less acceptable limits.

According to a recent study commissioned by Geenpeace from CE Delft, the number of private flights in Europe increased from just under 120,000 in 2020 to more than half a million in 2022. More than half of these flights are short to medium distance, comparable to the distance between Paris and Marseille (about 750 km), which in the vast majority of cases can be reasonably substituted by alternative means of transport. The top four routes for private flights in Europe are, in order, London-Paris (just over two hours by high-speed train), London-Nice (several scheduled flights per day), Paris-Geneva (just over three hours by high-speed train) and Paris-Nice (many scheduled flights or just over five hours by high-speed train).

Several national initiatives to ban luxury flights

A group of EU countries, namely Austria, the Netherlands, and France, recently wrote to the EU institutions calling for new regulations on the use of private jets (backed by Ireland and Belgium). The current EU Transport Commissioner has indicated that this will not happen, at least for now. Press reports suggest that the European Commission's approach is to legislate on aviation as a whole, rather than introducing specific rules for private jets.

Some EU countries are trying to fill this regulatory gap at EU level with national measures. France, for example, has discussed a ban on private flights (proposed by the left-wing coalition La France Insoumise (LFI) and supported by the Greens) and a super-tax on luxury flights (favoured by Emmanuel Macron's centrist government). The Dutch airport Amsterdam Schiphol is planning to restrict access to private aircraft. Spain is considering a ban on short-term private flights as part of its plan to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. There is every reason for the next European Commission to take up the climate leadership baton from the current one and close the regulation loophole that private aviation currently enjoys. If there is to be ambitious and accelerated climate action, everyone, including the richest, should be part of it.",theconversation.com,news,The Conversation,,-0.0980392156862745,453895171,3,https://images.theconversation.com/files/594572/original/file-20240516-21-uw5h95.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=19%2C178%2C4230%2C2115&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,

What have we learned? - Energy Post,"At the end of April the winners were announced of the first pilot auction to allocate subsidies for EU hydrogen production via the Hydrogen Bank. The winning bids were between €0.37 and €0.48 per kg, much lower than the €4 - €6 per kg ""green premium"" cost gap between renewable hydrogen and fossil hydrogen in Europe. The low bids mean companies applied for fewer subsidies than needed to bridge that ""green premium"" gap because they expected to find a buyer anyway. The results provide some insights into renewable hydrogen pricing and investment dynamics, explain James Kneebone at the Florence School of Regulation and Ben McWilliams at Bruegel. They explore three implications. Firstly, the low bids mean the subsidy pot will stretch further. But not far enough: Hydrogen Bank-supported projects will deliver less than a tenth of the EU Hydrogen Strategy target for 2030. Secondly, there is a great deal of private willingness to pay a premium for renewable hydrogen, partly driven by binding sectoral targets for industry and transport. And thirdly, all winning projects come from the Iberian Peninsula and the Nordics, both areas with strong renewable energy resources. In other words, ""renewables pull"" has an effect on the location of hydrogen-powered sectors, and that will have political implications, say the authors.

The first auction results from the Hydrogen Bank are in. This is the EU's public subsidy mechanism for renewable hydrogen production investments. Support is allocated through a pay-as-bid auction with the most competitive bids winning until the €800m budget is exhausted.

Firstly, the winning bids were between €0.37 and €0.48 per kg, which is much lower than the €4 - €6 per kg estimated green premium required to make renewable hydrogen cost-competitive with fossil hydrogen in Europe. This low price is broadly good news for the EU's hydrogen ambitions, suggesting the subsidy pot will be able to support larger volumes than previously thought.

Secondly, it means these subsidies cannot be the sole determining factor for investment decisions, given they cover only roughly 10% of the estimated green premium.

Finally, all winning projects come from either the Iberian Peninsula or the Nordics, both areas with strong renewable energy resources. This suggests a strong effect of the ""renewables pull"" for investments hypothesis.

Assuming winning projects go ahead, and similar bids are submitted in the second upcoming auction round, the Hydrogen Bank's endowment of €3 billion will translate into annual production of around 0.7 million tonnes (mt) by 2030 (or 6 GW of electrolyser capacity). For context, the 2020 EU Hydrogen Strategy set a target to produce 10 mt of renewable hydrogen by 2030.

Figure 1 demonstrates the Hydrogen Bank alone is insufficient for reaching these targets. Nevertheless, given the lower-than-anticipated subsidy of roughly €0.4 per kg, the budget can support the delivery of greater volumes of hydrogen than previously expected. For context, the winning bid price is a fraction of the roughly €11 per kg subsidy for winning bids in the UK's latest renewable hydrogen auction round, and still well below the maximum US 45V tax credit of $3 per kg. However, a recent Danish subsidy auction cleared its €164m budget below its ceiling price of €1.18 per kg, with some bids even lower than in the Hydrogen Bank auctions.

Given the average winning bid covers less than 10% of the green premium for renewable hydrogen production, we can infer that buyers are willing to pay a substantial premium for renewable hydrogen over fossil hydrogen. The offtaking partners for winning bids in the Hydrogen Bank were largely in the industrial and mobility sectors, with average final sale prices of €5.67 per kg and €8.34 per kg respectively.

This is partly driven by binding sectoral targets agreed by the European Council in the Renewable Energy Directive. For industry (like ammonia producers), 42.5% of hydrogen supply must be renewable by 2030. Renewable hydrogen products should constitute at least 1% of fuel supplied to the transport sector by 2030. We calculate that these obligations amount to roughly 4mt of clean hydrogen demand based on current fuel demand in these sectors.

Beyond regulation, all European renewable hydrogen production projects will also receive non-Hydrogen Bank financial support. From 2025 renewable hydrogen producers will be considered like their fossil counterparts in the EU Emissions Trading System. Consequently, they will receive a share of free allowances. With no carbon emissions to declare, these allowances can be sold for profit. These could be worth roughly €0.7 per kg based on recent ETS prices, although the number of free credits allocated will be phased down from 2026. Moreover, the winning bids from this first round of auctions are likely to be exempt from obligations to comply with the Delegated Act defining the 'additionality' of renewable electricity generation. The exemption allows for the use of otherwise subsidised renewable electricity capacity, which comprises a large share of the capital investment for a renewable hydrogen project.

Bids were clustered exclusively in the most northerly and southerly regions in the EU, where renewable electricity is the cheapest, supporting the 'renewable pull' hypothesis for energy-intensive industries. In short, economic pressures will arise for particular sectors to relocate from areas that historically benefitted from access to cheap supplies of fossil fuels (western/central Europe) to sites of cheap renewable energy (northern/southern Europe).

The disbursement of EU funds for clean technologies is geo-agnostic. The Innovation Fund (which provides the Hydrogen Bank funding) is distributed by objective techno-economic analysis to identify the most competitive projects. Strong determination of competitiveness by 'renewable pull' will create a challenge to reconcile European economic efficiency with national political interests.

Considering this, an innovative feature of the Hydrogen Bank is its offer for 'auctions-as-a-service'. This feature allows countries to contribute national funding which will be used to fund their most competitive domestic bids that did not clear under the European-wide threshold. This financial support benefits from special treatment under the state aid procedures in place to protect the Single Market from distortions.

Member States are therefore free to use national subsidies to protect or grow domestic hydrogen production. Germany is the sole country to have made use of this feature so far, contributing €350 million through 'auctions-as-a-service' to support 0.09 GW of domestic projects in the first round. The same €350 million distributed to the most efficient European projects would have supported approximately 0.7 GW or around eight times more capacity. Austria is reportedly also poised to contribute €400m to clear domestic projects at a similar bid price to Germany. A tension may emerge between regions with natural competitiveness for renewably-fuelled energy-intensive sectors and (fiscally powerful) countries with existing competitiveness in fossil-fuelled energy-intensive sectors.

President Ho Chi Minh's birthday celebrated abroad

A wide range of activities have been held by Vietnamese embassies in foreign countries to commemorate President Ho Chi Minh on the occasion of his 134th birthday (May 19, 1890).

The Vietnamese Embassy in Algeria on May 18 hosted a flower-offering ceremony in memory of the late leader, with the participation of Lai Xuan Mon, member of the Party Central Committee and standing deputy head of its Information and Education Commission, who is on a working visit to the country.

As part of the visit, Mon had a meeting with the authorities of Raïs Hamidou, a suburb of Algiers, where the Ho Chi Minh Avenue is located.

The local authorities said the avenue demonstrates the sentiments of Algerians to President Ho Chi Minh and Vietnamese people, and pledged to further coordinate with the embassy in organising activities in commemoration of the President.

The same day, the Vietnamese Embassies in France and Belgium and the authorities of Montreuil city on the outskirts of Paris jointly held a similar ceremony at the monument dedicated to President Ho Chi Minh at the Montreau Park.

Following the ceremony, participants visited a space dedicated to the President within the Museum of Living History at the park, where many objects and photos on the late leader are on display.

Also on May 18, a delegation of Vietnamese representative offices in New York and the Vietnamese community in Massachusetts state led by Ambassador Dang Hoang Giang, Vietnam's Permanent Representative to the UN, visited Omni Parker House in Boston city, where Uncle Ho once worked in the early years of his journey to seek ways for national salvation.

During his stay in New York and Boston, Nguyen Tat Thanh, who later became President Ho Chi Minh, studied the US struggle for independence, and witnessed and supported the movement for equal rights of Americans, taking it as inspiration and lessons for the cause of national liberation and reunification in Vietnam, the ambassador said.

On this occasion, John Murtha, General Manager of Omni Parker House, presented the Vietnamese Permanent Mission to the UN with a book on the history of the hotel, in which President Ho Chi Minh is one of the most mentioned figures.

To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory (1954 - 2024) and President Ho Chi Minh's birthday, the Vietnamese Embassy in Sri Lanka organised a Vietnamese culture event in its capital city of Colombo, with more than 200 guests.

Ninh Binh looks to promote trade cooperation with France's Paris Ile-de-France region

Ninh Binh commits to providing the most favourable conditions for all foreign investors and businesses, including French ones, to explore investment opportunities in the northern locality, Vice Secretary of the provincial Party Committee and Chairman of the People's Council Mai Van Tuat has said.

In a meeting with representatives from the Paris Île-de-France Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI Paris Île-de-France) as part of his working visit to France from May 15-17, Tuat briefed the host on Ninh Binh's potential and advantages for investment attraction, saying that the locality has been consistently and effectively implementing its green and sustainable economic development orientations.

With its strategic location, open policies, competitive incentives, and unique identity, Ninh Binh is said to be a safe and attractive destination for foreign investors, he stressed, noting that with its sustainable development, Ninh Binh prioritises projects of high-quality and value-added products.

The official expressed his hope that Ninh Binh will have an opportunity to expand development cooperation with French companies in areas such as processing and manufacturing industries, high-tech agriculture, ecotourism, and logistics.

He called on CCI Paris Île-de-France to support Ninh Binh in human resources training, environmental protection, preservation and promotion of heritage values, and tourism development, thus helping the locality take new steps in economic cooperation and investment with French investors.

Represenatives from CCI Paris Ile-de-France introduced operating models and services provided by the agency, saying that it plays a crucial role in promoting innovative initiatives.

It works to assist small- and medium-sized enterprises in penetrating new markets, protecting economic interests of businesses, and providing solutions to unleash potential and promote growth, they said.

According to Pierre Mongrué, Deputy Director General in charge of international cooperation at CCI Paris Ile-de-France, there are many potential areas for further cooperation between the two sides in the future.

He expressed his belief that France will serve as a gateway for Ninh Binh to access the EU market with over 400 million people, and the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) will provide a legal basis and create favourable mechanisms to help Vietnamese businesses in general, and those in Ninh Binh in particular, penetrate this market.

During their stay, Ninh Binh's delegation met with representatives of the Vietnamese Embassy in France, visited and laid flowers at the statue of President Ho Chi Minh in Montreau Park, and toured the Ho Chi Minh Space in the Living History Museum in Montreuil city./.

President Ho Chi Minh's birthday marked in Cambodia

An incense offering ceremony was held at the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia on May 17 in celebration of the 134th birth anniversary of President Ho Chi Minh (May 19, 1890 - 2024), a great leader of the Vietnamese people and the working class and an eminent soldier of the workers' movement and the international communist movement.

In his speech, Ambassador Nguyen Huy Tang highlighted the fruitful development of relations between Vietnam and Cambodia with substantive and effective achievements across fields from political, diplomatic, defence - security, and economic, trade, and investment cooperation.

Party orrganisations of Vietnamese representative agencies have implemented successfully political tasks in all areas, from politics, economics, national defense and security, culture, citizen protection, and those related to people of the Vietnamese origin in Cambodia.

He took the occasion to call on Party members, officials, the business community, and the Vietnamese community in Cambodia to continue studying and following President Ho Chi Minh's thought, morality and lifestyle; and exert efforts to fulfill all tasks of 2024 in all aspects.

He suggested the Vietnamese community in Cambodia uphold the tradition of solidarity and mutual support to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and strictly abide by laws of the host country.

The diplomat also urged them to make more contributions to the homeland, and continue to serve as a solid bridge for the Vietnam-Cambodia relationship./.

Vietnam eyes to boost science, technology cooperation with Brazil

Ambassador of Vietnam to Brazil Bui Van Nghi has emphasised that cooperation in science and technology is one of the priority areas between the two countries, especially in telecommunications, high technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, quantum science, aerospace, and aviation.

During a recent working session with Brazilian Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation Luciana Santos, the Vietnamese diplomat underlined the necessity of establishing a joint commission on science, technology, and innovation between the two countries to promote bilateral cooperation, saying that Vietnam desires to learn from Brazil's experience in bioethanol technology, agricultural product processing industry, mining, climate change adaptation, and space technology in the near future.

He highly valued Brazil's aviation technology, including narrow-body aircraft produced by Embraer, which are suitable for Vietnam's aviation and tourism transportation demand.

Regarding the historic floods that caused significant human, property, and infrastructure losses in Brazil in recent times, the ambassador emphasised that the Government and people of Vietnam always stand in solidarity with Brazil during this difficult time.

For her part, Minister Luciana Santos said Vietnam has become an attractive destination for foreign enterprises and companies specialising in producing chips and semiconductors, therefore, potential for cooperation between the two countries is enormous.

She expressed her impression for Vietnam's achievements in science and technology after her working visit to the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology in November 2023.

Santos affirmed that science, technology, and innovation are among the priorities in Brazil's foreign policy, and her country is making efforts to promote the implementation of agreements signed with Vietnam.

The official revealed that a delegation of Brazilian experts will visit and work with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam at the end of this month./.

President Ho Chi Minh's birthday marked in Havana

Representatives of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples (ICAP) and the Vietnamese Embassy in Cuba have laid flowers at the Ho Chi Minh Park in Havana to mark the 134th birthday of the Vietnamese late leader (May 19, 1890-2024).

The ceremony drew ICAP President Fernando González Llort, Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam Nguyen Van Tien, and Vietnamese Ambassador to Cuba Le Quang Long, as well as representatives of many agencies and organisations of Cuba and the Vietnamese community in the country.

Addressing the event, Ambassador Long highlighted the legacy left by President Ho Chi Minh, a national liberation hero, an eminent revolutionary of the national liberation movement and international communist and workers' movements, a world figure of culture, and the beloved leader of Vietnamese people.

Also on May 19, 129 years ago, Cuban hero José Martí fell down during the struggle for national liberation of Cuba, he noted, holding that this was a coincidence of the two leaders. Vietnam and Cuba also share the common spirit of patriotism and ideology values, he stated.

The desire for freedom and independence of each nation and the progressive ideology of each nation's historical leaders formed a solid foundation for Vietnam and Cuba to cultivate a faithful and lasting friendship, the diplomat emphasised.

For his part, Vice President of the Cuba-Vietnam Friendship Association Ruvislei González Sáez affirmed that the ideology of President Ho Chi Minh, one of the most important figures of the 20th century, has remained alive among the 100 million people of Vietnam and revolutionaries in the world.

González Sáez honoured the late leader as a figure with universal stature, a great revolutionary who fought tirelessly for the best cause of Vietnam and humanity, and a very great man who was also very humble.

The Cuban scholar said that his organisation and the ICAP as well as the Havana University hope to study more deeply into the Ho Chi Minh ideology and promote the Vietnamese leader's legacy in the new era.

He expressed his belief that the future generations of the two countries will inherit the eternal values left by the leader, promoting the growth of the two countries in peace and heading to socialism, while fostering the special ties between the two nations.

At the ceremony, local children performed songs, dances and poems honouring President Ho Chi Minh and the special solidarity between the two nations./.

Cuban researcher praises President Ho Chi Minh's ideology

President Ho Chi Minh is a figure with universal stature, a great revolutionary who fought tirelessly for the best for Vietnamese people and humanity, and a very great but humble man, said Dr. Ruvislei González Sáez, one of the leading researchers on Vietnam in Latin America.

In a recent interview granted to the Vietnam News Agency on the occasion of the 134th birthday of the late leader (May 19, 1890-2024), Saez, who is also Vice President of the Cuba-Vietnam Friendship Association, affirmed that the great ideology of President Ho Chi Minh, one of the most important figures in the 20th century, has remained alive among the 100 million Vietnamese people and revolutionaries in the world.

According to the Cuban researcher, the late leader's ideology has gone beyond the borders of Vietnam and had a great influence on all humanity.

He stressed that he is especially impressed with the simple, humble and closeness manner of President Ho Chi Minh.

The Cuban scholar said that his organisation, the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples (ICAP), and the Havana University hope to conduct more intensive studies on the Ho Chi Minh ideology and promote the Vietnamese leader's legacy in the new era.

President Ho Chi Minh was born on May 19, 1890 in Kim Lien commune, Nam Dan district, the central province of Nghe An. He devoted his whole life to the cause of national liberation, while tirelessly striving for peace and progress around the world.

He led the struggle for national independence and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, now the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, in 1945.

The President passed away in 1969. His body was embalmed and placed in a glass coffin inside a granite mausoleum in the capital city of Hanoi.

British historian praises President Ho Chi Minh's role in national liberation

It is hard to see national liberation, reunification or path through peace and independence of Vietnam as a nation without the presence of President Ho Chi Minh and the stamp of his personality, British historian John Callow has said in a recent interview with the Vietnam News Agency on the occasion of the 134th birthday the later leader.

""Ho Chi Minh was an incredible figure on so many different levels: man of action, revolutionary, patriot, scholar, poet, politician, theorist and great Marxist, having all of these in his make-up, blended together like veins of gold running through him,"" stated John Callow.

According to the historian, Ho Chi Minh was a forerunner who he was on the road to where he wanted to be, to the great vision of unification. He laid a very clear road map to bring freedom, and prosperity to his country and people.

At times in his early career, Ho Chi Minh stood absolutely alone, the British scholar said, citing when he was at the founding conference of the Communist Party of France in the streets of Paris taking his message to the League of Nations appeals on behalf of the Vietnamese people who did not yet have a state. He always carried with him the vision of better days ahead and sought to achieve it.

""It was a long, incredibly rich career that saw him constantly learning, adapting, evolving, always carrying the people with him, always having a sense of what was new, of how the West and its industry and its ideas could not submerge Vietnam, but how those positive elements within it could enhance what was already there in Vietnamese culture,"" he noted.

The historian further said that is one of the secrets of the greatness of Ho Chi Minh, a man who could combine so many facets, a leader in the richest and most democratic sense of that word who could inspire people, who understood world culture and Vietnamese culture and combined the progressive legacies of Confucianism alongside the positive legacies of the West. Ho Chi Minh's Marxism was not a dogma, was not something that could not be approved upon or applied, but was a guide to action that was creative, that could be individually tailored, and used above all in the service of the people.

For all these facts, Ho Chi Minh was truly remarkable. A world statesman of the highest calibre who understood socialist internationalism to his fingertips, who always saw unity- unity of the Party, of the people, but also of the wider socialist movement, he stated.

Speaking about Ho Chi Minh Thought, Callow said his writings, the four little volumes produced in the English language during the 1960s and the 1970s, are incredibly rich and varied. They deal with day to day topics, living in the moment, the problems of fighting imperialism, the problems of building in the future, items of Vietnamese traditional culture, the roles of religion, of women, and of the family.

According to Callow, there is nothing that his Thought does not touch, and within all of this, it is a creative conversation with his readership, with the people. It provides a spur to action, but also a very firm moral compass, rooted in the people, in the land, in the alliance with the small peasantry themselves. And all of these were the preconditions for victory, for transformation, for statehood, for breaking the shackles of empire and domination, and for removing the racism that had been vested upon the Vietnamese people, under French, and then under American colonisation.

The British scholar pointed out on all kinds of levels, President Ho Chi Minh's message is freeing people, freeing their minds, freeing the chains of poverty, of absolute poverty, of subjugation, of allowing the nation to enjoy its full riches, to escape a poverty not only that is absolute in terms of having a good standard of living, but also a mental poverty being shackled into a colonial deferential mindset.

In his opinion, President Ho Chi Minh's Thought is truly remarkable, because it folds just like the finely tempered steel of a metal blade, with so many different sources and ideas. Ho Chi Minh, whose father was a Confucian scholar, has seen Vietnamese traditional culture. But also he had been to Europe, and in that experience of really being in the centre of the European Enlightenment thought, the world of Spinoza as well as Marx or Lenin, never once did he abandon his own host culture.

He never lost sight of his people or their great cultural gains. So everything he learned, everything he brought back, the version of Marxism that he forged through the struggle of the Independence War, was a creative process where he was able to take the very best from Western thought and philosophy and economics and marry it to Vietnamese traditional culture.

""This has made Ho Chi Minh Thought so durable. It was a process to seeing the world, a guide to action, and a series of principles. He pointed out that has what has enabled the Party and people of Vietnam to go forward in a creative manner, to surmount the terrible difficulties they've had since the late 1980s, to survive in a world that so often is hostile to them, to creatively apply the principles of Doi Moi (Renewal),"" he said.

The historian said today Vietnam is changing, being on the global scene and operating in global markets. The country has recovered itself splendidly and its young vibrant population deserve the good things in life. He believed President Ho Chi Minh's creative dynamic could lead seamlessly to the achievements of national liberation through the terrible fights that inspired generations of Vietnamese to follow in his flame, to follow in his path, to make those sacrifices for a better world.

John Callow is a historian, author and trade unionist. He has written widely on Early Modern witchcraft, politics and popular culture. His books include Witchcraft & Magic in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe (co-authored with Professor Geoffrey Scarre); James II: King in Exile; Embracing the Darkness: A Cultural History of Witchcraft, and The Last Witches of England: A Tragedy of Sorcery and Superstition.

Cuba, Vietnam boost cooperation in justice

A delegation from the Supreme People's Court led by its Deputy Chief Justice Nguyen Van Tien made an official visit to Cuba from May 13- to May 18 to foster bilateral ties and attend the 11th International Meeting of Justice and Law.

At a working session with Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court of Cuba Rubén Remigio Ferro, Tien highlighted the developments in judicial cooperation between the two countries and informed the host about main reforms in the Vietnamese court system in recent times, including fine-tuning institutions, reforming judicial administrative procedures, building electronic courts and applying information technology in court activities.

In its long-term judicial reform strategy, Vietnam aims for a people-centred justice, improve judge capacity, and build electronic courts and strengthen international experience exchange, Tien said.

He also emphasized the need for the two countries to continue to cultivate and develop the close-knit relationship between their court systems in the time ahead.

For his part, the Cuban chief justice shared the orientation for the modernization of the Cuban court system, and noted the similar points in the process of revamping the judicial system in the two countries.

Showing his interest in Vietnam's experience in judicial reconciliation, Ferro suggested launching knowledge exchanges or thematic workshops on the issue to better tap the similarities between the two countries.

On the occasion, the Vietnamese official handed over some laptops as a gift from the Vietnam Supreme People's Court to the Cuban counterpart.

The 11th International Meeting of Justice and Law, which ran from May 15-17 in Havana, drew the participation of some 400 delegates from Cuba and other countries.

Discussions primarily focused on issues related to population aging, the legality and impartiality of judges in the administration of justice; the interpretation of the Law, family, civil and administrative matters; and the response to domestic and gender violence.

During their stay in Cuba, the Vietnamese delegation attended a flower offering ceremony in commemoration of the 134th birthday of President Ho Chi Minh at a park named after Ho Chi Minh in Havana and visit the Fidel Castro Centre.

HCM City prepares for rainy season

HCM City has finished many flood-control projects to fight flooding in the coming rainy season.

After the city suffered months of heat waves, some heavy rains hit the densely-populated southern metropolis. However, heavy rain also caused flooding on many roads in the city.

According to the city's Department of Construction, the city has had 18 flooded roads (13 roads flooded due to rain and five roads flooded due to high tide).

The specific list of 13 main roads flooded by rain includes Phan Anh, Lê Đức Thọ, Quang Trung, Nguyễn Văn Khối (Cây Trâm), Hồ Học Lãm, National Highway No.1, Đặng Thị Rành, Dương Văn Cam, Kha Vạn Cân, Bạch Đằng, Thảo Điền, Quốc Hương and Nguyễn Văn Hưởng.

Meanwhile, the list of flooded roads due to high tide includes Huỳnh Tấn Phát, Trần Xuân Soạn, Lê Văn Lương, Đào Sư Tích and Highway 50.

In fact, many places not on this list were flooded. On the afternoon of May 8, after only about 15 minutes of rain, some areas in Thủ Đức City were flooded, including Lê Văn Việt, Tô Ngọc Vân and Võ Văn Ngân streets, and Hà Nội Highway.

Mai Hữu Quyết, vice chairman of Thủ Đức City People's Committee, commented that Võ Văn Ngân street is a heavily flooded area of Thủ Đức City in recent years.

In the near future, Thủ Đức City will have many renovation projects to solve the overall problem of flooding in the locality.

Besides Võ Văn Ngân Street, the city will strive to start and complete seven projects to upgrade anti-flood embankments, 36 drainage projects, and expand 60 alleys.

To prepare for the rainy season, the city's Department of Construction said it has planned to put into operation a series of flood-control projects.

The department plans to operate 380 tidal check valves, and five mobile pumping stations with a capacity from 1,000 cubic metres (cu.m) of water per hour to 2,000cu.m of water per hour.

Along with 380 tidal check valves and five mobile pumping stations, ten other pumping stations and large tide control gates in Bình Triệu, Bình Lợi, Lăng Canal, Nhảy - Ruột Ngựa Canal, Nhiêu Lộc - Thị Nghè, Bà Tiếng Canal, Phú Lâm, Thanh Đa, Mễ Cốc 1 and Mễ Cốc 2 will be operated synchronously to mitigate flooding from high tide.

In addition, the department and relevant units have implemented projects to build and renovate drainage systems to solve flooding on 18 main roads such as Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, Tân Quý, Ba Vân, Trương Công Định, Bàu Cát, Lê Đức Thọ, Quang Trung, Nguyễn Văn Khối, Đặng Thị Rành and Bạch Đằng streets in Bình Thạnh District; Thảo Điền, Quốc Hương, Nguyễn Văn Hưởng, Dương Văn Cam and Kha Vạn Cân streets and the National Highway 1A section in Thủ Đức City; and Phan Anh and Hồ Học Lãm streets in districts 6, 8 and Bình Tân.

Lý Thanh Long, chief of staff of the city Department of Construction, said that the city is preparing to do three projects to prevent flooding and improve drainage pipes in Gò Vấp District.

These projects include improving the drainage system of Nguyễn Van Khối - Lê Văn Thọ Street, Quang Trung Street (from Phạm Văn Chiêu to Chợ Cầu bridge) and Lê Đức Thọ Street (from Phạm Văn Chiêu to Cụt bridge).

In addition, the department has directed the city Technical Infrastructure Management Centre to repair degraded sewers, and dredge sewer beds and canals, Long said.

The city is also preparing to invest in four projects including the Hy Vọng Canal renovation project, the Văn Thánh Canal dredging and improvement project, and Bà Lớn Canal drainage project.

The project to dredge, build infrastructure, and improve the environment on the bank of Đôi Canal in District 8 is expected to start and be completed in the period 2026-2030.

Summer vacation safety concerns for Hà Nội students

With summer vacation just around the corner, many parents in Hà Nội are already worrying about how to keep their children safe and engaged during the long break.

Some parents are concerned about their children spending too much time indoors glued to electronic devices, while others worry about the risk of drowning or other accidents.

Nguyễn Bích Hạnh, whose youngest child attends kindergarten in Cầu Giấy District, said she has to send him to her parent's house for childcare during the summer vacation as she and her husband are too busy working.

""We have to send our little one to stay with his grandparents for peace of mind,"" said Hạnh. ""Leaving her home alone is not an option because we cannot ensure proper supervision to prevent accidents.""

Phạm Thu Hiên from Ba Đình District is at a loss for what to do with her son during the summer break. She is worried that he would spend all his time watching TV and glued to his smartphone if she left him at home.

""Social media exposes kids to so much inappropriate content that it's hard to monitor,"" said Hiên.

But she is also not at ease sending him to the countryside because there are many ponds and lakes. Her only option now seems to be enrolling him in swimming and martial arts classes.

To alleviate parents' concerns about their children's summer activities, the Hà Nội's Department of Education has issued a plan to organise the activities for students.

The plan requires schools to collaborate with local HCM Youth Union and Young Pioneers' Councils to ensure students are properly supervised and engaged in safe community activities during the summer break.

The department also requested schools to allow students to access school facilities such as libraries and gyms during the off-school period for studying and recreation.

Regarding academic studies, schools in Hà Nội are strictly prohibited from organising extra classes or supplemental instruction during the summer break. Summer academic review is solely reserved for students with subpar academic performance.

Water safety remains a pressing concern as drowning incidents tragically claim young lives each summer.

Many schools have installed ""smart swimming pools"" to offer swimming lessons and water safety training. Local authorities also organise courses on drowning prevention, survival skills, and emergency response in this regard.

Nguyễn Hồng Thúy, Principal of Tâm Tiến Junior School in Chương Mỹ District, highlighted the importance of parent-school cooperation in caring for students.

She said even though students are not in school during the summer break, the school remains actively involved, instructing teachers to keep an eye on their students and collaborating with their parents during the year-end summary meeting to discuss summer vacation-related matters.

Parents are particularly encouraged to keep a close watch their children and minimise potential risks that could lead to accidents or injuries during the summer.

HCM City strives to complete HCM City - Mộc Bài Expressway by 2027

The Prime Minister expects to approve the investment policy of the HCM City - Mộc Bài expressway project this week, allowing the city to start the project before April 30, 2025, and complete it by the end of 2027.

Its best films have been selected to screen and compete at over 50 international film festivals around the world.

One of the contest's highlighted winners is Phạm Ngọc Lân, who graduated from the Hà Nội University of Architecture but later followed his passion to make independent films.

Lân won the Best Film at the International Competition for Fiction & Documentaries at the 16th VIS Vienna Shorts Festival in Austria in 2019, one year after winning at the CJ Short Film Making Project.

His 19-minute black and white film, Một Khu Đất Tốt (Blessed Land) tells the story of a mother and son looking for a father's tomb at a cemetery.

The work also won Special Mention Award from the jury at the International Shorts Competition at the 20th Las Palmas de Gran Canaria International Film Festival in the Canary Islands in 2019.

High-quality science, technology human resources key to sustainable growth

To achieve sustainable development and help the economy take off, high-quality human resources and advancements in science and technology should be seen as key components, according to insiders.

Prof. Dr. Nguyen Dinh Duc - Chairman of the University Council of University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University-Hanoi, said in many industries, especially in manufacturing where the highest concentration of FDI projects are located, the rate of employed and trained workers is limited.

Dr. Tran Van Khai, a standing member of the Committee for Science, Technology and Environment of the National Assembly, said the development of high-quality human resources has recorded good results in recent times.

Vietnam has established policies to attract and retain talent, experts, and highly skilled workers through attractive salary, bonus, and welfare policies, he said, noting that attention has been paid to training and developing high-quality human resources.

The number of entrepreneurs and skilled workers is increasing, importantly contributing to the country's development, he added.

However, the structure of vocational training has not closely aligned with the labour market's demand, especially in emerging economic sectors. At the same time, there is a shortage of labourers in spearhead economic sectors and those serving the digital economy.

Khai stressed that it is urgent to build breakthrough policies to address existing shortcomings and limitations that are hindering the development of high-quality human resources and labour productivity.

For the semiconductor industry, the latest report from the Ministry of Planning and Investment indicates that Vietnam needs to train 50,000 - 100,000 high-quality workers for the sector from 2025 to 2030.

According to Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha, to train tens of thousands of high-quality workers in the industry, priority must be given to training and attracting high-quality teachers and lecturers with deep expertise.

Emphasising the crucial role of human resources and promoting scientific research activities in implementing the goal of strengthening national competitiveness and innovation capacity, Minister of Science and Technology Huynh Thanh Dat said ministries will continue to improve policies and encourage a favourable environment for scientists at universities to maximise their research capacity.

Universities should also prioritise substantial investments in improving the quality of undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as developing high-quality scientific and technological human resources, he said.

The minister also suggested the National Foundation for Science and Technology research and direct sponsorship programmes to strongly promote outstanding research groups and develop high-level scientific and technological research human resources, especially young talent./.

Vietnam, AFD strengthen cooperation, promote energy transition

Vietnam wants to deepen the traditional reliable relations and strategic partnership with France, particularly the French Development Agency (AFD), said Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha while receiving AFD Deputy Director General Marie-Hélène Loison in Hanoi.

During the reception, Ha appreciated the results of AFD's activities in Vietnam as well as changes in its organisational apparatus for wider and more effective access to new development fields.

Ha said that besides institutionalising mechanisms and policies on green transition and just energy transition, Vietnam needs advice on techniques, institutional improvement, technology selection, governance models, and financial resources in the fields of energy, transportation, agriculture, and urban areas.

Such advice will help Vietnam to determine actual needs, and plans for effective use of domestic resources, loans, and sponsorship sources, Ha said.

He noted that AFD's studies on green transition, climate change response, and energy transition will provide ""solution packages"" for investment, science and technology, and technical infrastructure development in Vietnam.

Regarding green transition and just energy transition, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Government of Vietnam is discussing with partners to soon pilot several offshore wind power projects, adding the country also promotes the participation of the private sector in renewable electricity production.

""AFD's research results can also support French businesses to find investment and business cooperation projects in Vietnam,"" Ha said.

For her part, Marie-Hélène Loison affirmed that AFD and its partners are always ready to provide technical advice and support for Vietnam to improve the legal framework, find financial sources to implement important socio-economic development programmes and projects in Vietnam, especially in the fields of energy transition, climate change response, and green transition.

Since 2019, AFD has coordinated with the Vietnamese side to implement a project to research the socio-economic impacts of climate change in Vietnam and the climate change adaptation strategy. The two sides have launched Phase 2 of the project with priority given to assessing the socio-economic impacts of the energy transition process in Vietnam./.",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.2078431372549019,453870503,1,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2024/5/20/vietnam-news-headlines-may-202024-159608d9ecca448ebae530335aaa1791-1045.webp?width=0&s=AvEkvSV_kLtX-UddoIIJEg,eng-9582238

Good morning. This is a chorus call conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Snam First Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Francesca Pezzoli, Head of Investor Relations of Snam. Please go ahead, Madam.

Francesca Pezzoli

Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Snam Q1 2024 consolidated results. Today's presentation will be hosted by our CEO, Stefano Venier and by our CFO, Luca Passa. In the presentation, Stefano will provide you an overview of the key highlights of the period. Luca will walk you through the financial performance. Then back to Stefano for closing remarks and finally, the Q&A session.

And now, I will hand over to Stefano.

Stefano Venier

Good morning. Let me go through key highlights on Page 2. First quarter posted a strong performance with the adjusted EBITDA at EUR703 million, up 18% year-on-year mainly thanks to the weighted average cost of capital uplift, the ROSS effect, the RAB growth and the output based incentives. Adjusted net income at EUR335 million is up 11% year-on-year while investments reached EUR462 million, up 48% versus Q1 2023 and the net debt at EUR15.8 billion with 2.4% average net cost of debt.

Gas demand declined by 2.6%. This, along with well-supplied market and high gas storage level in Europe contributed to keep average gas prices 50% below the same period of last year. In April, gas prices experienced some volatility due to the colder weather conditions and the continuous geopolitical tensions.

As known, the annual weighted average cost of capital update triggered an uplift of 80 bps on transport and 60 basis points on storage and LNG applied from January '24. The base, ROSS, was applied to transport from 2024 with positive effect on [fast-slow-money] (ph) accounting. We have been contributed to the working groups set by the Italian Ministry of Energy and Environment, which has the target to release the H2 strategy by the summer along with the National Energy Plan and to define the CCS framework by the autumn. The European Commission announced recently the results of the pipe of the EU Hydrogen Bank auctions, awarding more than EUR700 million, corresponding to 90% of the total available subsidy pool to several renewable hydrogen production projects across different areas and sectors.

Moving to our associates. We continue with our active portfolio management. As you know, we have exercised the preemption right to increase from 7.3% to 30% our stake in Adriatic LNG regas unit terminal following the signing with -- by VTTI of the agreement to acquire a majority stake in the company. The closing of the transaction is expected by the year-end. The deal will further strengthen our asset platform in the LNG sector up to 20 bcm. Moreover, we are in the exclusive negotiation until June with the Edison for the potential acquisition of Edison Stoccaggio. At the same time, our strategy is to extract value from existing portfolio, and we are actively engaging with the Austrian regulator for 2025, 2027 tariff review. The new reference price methodology is under consultation, and we expect the final determination by the end of May. It will provide volume risk stabilization and increase in the visibility of the next three-year regulatory period.

Turning to Page 3. We are progressing on our strategy to become a pan-European multi-molecule operator, leveraging on synergies between gas infrastructure and energy transition businesses. Starting from gas infrastructure, first, the works for the first phase of the Adriatic corridor, the backbone to strengthen the south to north capacity just started, and we are progressing with the works with the Ravenna FSRU terminal. To the latter, the onshore segment is 70% complete with the offshore part is at 30% and the platform construction started in this space. Storage level reached 60% at the end of the winter, well above the historical levels for this period of the year. It was also supported by 3 bcm of commercial reverse flow service that we delivered to the system, and it will be help keeping under control gas prices volatility and making the infilling season smoother. Finally, 100% of the 12.4 bcm of storage capacity for the 2024, 2025 thermal year was allocated, of which 6.4 bcm during auction in April.

Let's now move into energy transition. The two projects, SouthH2Corridor and the Callisto Mediterranean CCS in Ravenna in which we are involved as a partner, as you know, have both been confirmed by the European Commission in the sixth list of projects of common interest. The market sound, we launched to assess the hard-to-abate industry's appetite was completed with large participation with more than 150 companies responding to the questioner. And the pilot phase of the Ravenna CCS project is on track. The injection phase will start by summer. With respect to Ravenna backlog, it is stable at EUR1.2 billion, while on biomethane, eight plants won tariff auction corresponding to 18 megawatts, of which two are already under upgrade construction to biomethane.

Finally, moving to sustainability and governance. CapEx aligned to EU taxonomy and SDGs represent, respectively, 34% and 55% of the total in Q1 2024. Following an extensive engagement with the shareholder head of the AGM, we have further improved the average approval rate at approximately 99% vis-a-vis the 97% of last year. According to the most recent shareholder analysis carried out, ESG investors represent about 50% of our institutional investors base, well above sector and Italian average. Finally, net zero assessment assigned by Moody's to our emission targets confirm a trajectory in line with the Paris Agreements.

On Page 4, you have a summary on gas demand and flows. In Q1 2024, demand was about 20 bcm, down 2.6% or 0.5 bcm vis-a-vis Q1 2023. In detail, thermoelectric sector was down 4.8% year-on-year, driven by higher hydroelectric and renewable production, increase in net electricity imports due to larger availability of nuclear in France that was partly offset by lower utilization of coal and electricity demand increase. Civil sector contracted by around 0.2 bcm due to milder temperatures, especially in March and the impact of the energy efficiency. Whilst industrial sector was up 1.8%, and we expect further growth to -- due to the gas price projections for the next month. Moving to the gas flows. Energy import made about 20% of the total demand, also thanks to the operations of the Piombino plant from July 2023.

Now I will turn to Luca for the financial results. Thank you.

Luca Passa

Good morning to everyone. Thanks, Stefano. We are now on Slide number 5 to comment on first quarter 2024 EBITDA. EBITDA for the period was EUR703 million, plus 18% versus last year or EUR106 million. The growth is mainly attributable to regulatory items for a total of around EUR58 million related to the WACC increase for EUR42 million and to the ROSS effect on transport for EUR16 million.

Regulated revenues change was driven by transport and storage revenues increased by around EUR50 million, output base rise by EUR50 million related to the contribution of output based on fully depreciated assets that in 2023 were recognized starting from the second quarter, the contribution from storage reverse flows services, partially counterbalanced by the decrease of output base related to the full services. A positive volume effect counterbalanced by the expected phase out of input-based incentives. Piombino FSRU started operations from July 2023 and contributed positive by EUR60 million in the first quarter 2024. The increase in regulated fixed cost is attributable to lower costs in large part due to the extension of the employees' health insurance and labor inflation. With regards to the energy transition businesses, the end of the Super-Ecobonus incentive on energy efficiency, along with the consolidation of 8 megawatts of biomethane plants drove to a natural contribution in the first quarter of 2024.

Moving to Slide 6. Adjusted net income for the period was EUR335 million, plus 11% compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to higher D&A by EUR28 million following writing investment and EUR12 million write-down on gas infrastructure. Net financial expenses are higher by EUR36 million, mainly as a result of higher net cost of debt, which moved from 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023 to approximately 2.4% in the first quarter of 2024 as the effect of the increase in interest rates. A substantially flat contribution from associates, which was the result of higher contribution of Italian associates for EUR3 million and lower international associates contribution for EUR2 million. Slightly higher taxes, with a tax rate of 24.8% versus 24.5% in the first quarter 2023.

Moving to Slide 7. Our international associates positively contributed to group net income by EUR52 million or down 4% vis-a-vis last year. TAP inflation-adjusted tariffs drove higher contribution compared to last year in the first quarter of 2024. TAP covered 17% of Italian imports, recording a plus 3% increase in the short-term bookings on top of the long-term capacity. Works for the 1.2 bcm expansion deriving from the 2021 market tests are underway. EMG performance benefited mostly from the recording of positive nonrecurring items related to previous years.

Moving to Austria. The decline of TAG reflects lower imports to Italy and consequently lower bookings vis-a-vis first quarter 2023, partially offset by more power of product mix towards short-term bookings, mainly March, that contributed EUR6 million above expectation in the quarter. On the other end, GCA performance in the first quarter benefits from lower energy costs due to the price effect. On Terega performance already reflects the new regulatory period starting in 2024, in line with our expectation. The decline versus the first quarter of 2023 is due to higher operating costs, which, however, we expect to partially brush off over the year. ADNOC performance is substantially in line with expectation. Looking at Interconnector UK, the operating performance remained strong with a contribution in line with the yearly regulatory cap. The capacity is booked at almost 50% as till 2026, providing medium-term visibility.

Moving to SeaCorridor. After the drop of Russian imports, it represents the first Italian import route with approximately 5 bcm in entry out of 15 of total Italian imports in the first quarter of 2024. Performance, however, is slightly lower, mainly due to the lower volumes, reflecting the decline in demand.

Desfa's lower contribution is the result of lower auction premium on LNG imports and export towards Bulgaria, now closer to historical trends. Nonetheless, Greek gas demand is increasing amidst the ongoing lean night phase out and the recovery of the industrial production and power generation. Desfa is progressing also on its ambitious $1.3 billion CapEx plan that will support the Southeastern Europe market development.

Turning now to cash flow on Slide number 8. Funds from operation for the period amounting to around EUR538 million were partially absorbed by EUR119 million of working capital. This was driven by a broadly neutral impact from regulatory working capital with about EUR550 million absorption due to the balancing activity of which, EUR250 million related to a reduction in balancing item payables, about EUR200 million related to the cash deposit decrease due to the gas price reduction and about EUR100 million related to the full service net increase. All of this partially counterbalanced by EUR470 million of tariff-related items, mainly driven by additional tariff components. And finally, EUR100 million of energy efficiency net working capital absorption driven by the fiscal credit related to the Super-Ecobonus revenues.

Net investment for the period amount to EUR531 million and breakdown as follows. EUR462 million of CapEx, around EUR90 million of CapEx payables decrease, and about EUR20 million of other items. Other outflows were related to the payment of the interim dividend for EUR376 million, resulting in a change in net debt of about EUR523 million.

Moving to Slide number 9. Net debt amounted to EUR15.8 billion. Net cost of debt, which is calculated as the financial charges net of liquidity income on average net debt for the period went from 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023 to 2.4% in the first quarter of 2024 and the fixed floating mix is above 70%. Funding for the year is almost completed, leaving the remaining part of the year for opportunistic 2025 refunding activities. To date, we executed EUR450 million of bank financing, which is sustainability linked, EUR1.5 billion of bonds in February via green bond, the first ever green bond issued by Snam and a sustainability-linked bond linked to the Scope 1 and 2 and for the first time, also Scope 3.

In addition, leveraging our supporting market environment in April, we issued a two-year EUR750 million floating rate bond for our treasury management optimization. The sustainable finance ratio is at 84%, well on track to reach our long-term target. Also, we're proud to have recently received for the second year, the Transition Bond Award of the Year by Environmental Finance for our EU taxonomy aligned transition bond exchangeable in Italgas share that we issued in September 2023.

Moving to Slide 10 on our guidance. Thanks to our strong first quarter performance, which was ahead of expectation, we can upgrade our full year guidance provided at the strategic plan presentation on 25th of January. And in 2024, we expect CapEx will reach EUR3 billion, slightly ahead of the EUR2.9 million guidance, mainly due to the realization of the breakwater in Ravenna. The year-on-year increase is driven by gas infrastructure investments, which includes, among others, the start of the electric line and moving and connection investment for the second new FSRU in Ravenna. Tariff RAB is up around 6% year-on-year at EUR23.8 billion. We expect EBITDA in excess of EUR2.75 billion versus the previous guidance of EUR2.7 billion, mainly thanks to stronger contribution of output-based incentives. The year-on-year growth is driven by the WACC uplift and the flatter impact, Ross effect on transport and RAB growth.

Adjusted net income guidance moved to approximately EUR1.230 billion from the previous EUR1.180 billion, up 5% year-on-year. The upgrade is due to better EBITDA performance, coupled with lower financial charges and higher contribution from our international associates. Net debt at EUR17.5 billion expected versus the EUR17.6 billion, despite the increase of CapEx, thanks to a better expected cash conversion at 80%. It includes about EUR400 million of working capital absorption expected and the cash-out for the increase of the stake increase in Adriatic LNG. The dividend policy going forward envisage minimum 3% dividend annual growth.

And now let me hand over to Stefano for the closing remarks.

Stefano Venier

Thank you. Thank you, Luca. Let me say, in conclusion, we think we have had another year in which we will deliver strong results. A good Q1 led us to upgrade of our full year guideline on all lines. That implies one year add on 2027 plan delivery. This is supported by high visibility over regulation and investments and macro environment, which is stabilizing and policies evolving in line with our strategy. Therefore, we can offer to shareholders an attractive growth profile coupled with a compelling dividend, while keeping a solid balance sheet and financial flexibility.

So then thank you very much for your attention. And now we are available to take all your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Javier Suarez, Mediobanca.

Javier Suarez

Good morning and thank you for the presentation. I have several questions. The first one is on the guidance increase. It has been explained by better-than-expected output-based incentives on the storage business. So can you share with us the -- how are you moving your expectation for the collection of these output-based incentives by the year-end. And we have seen the collection during the first quarter of the year and the underlying reason behind for this better performance during the first quarter. That would be the first question. The second question is on the international associates, there has been certainly better than expected performance I guess versus the company's previous expectation. If you can help us to understand the moving pieces, which is the associate that has surprised the most during the first quarter and what we may expect in terms of contribution from this associate by the year-end. And I'm particularly interested on, you can share with us your expectations for the regulatory review in Austria that you have announced that should be unveiled by the end of May. Any detail on your expectation on that important regulatory review would be welcome. And the final thought is on the first implementation of the new [reg] (ph) framework, you can help us to understand the positive impact during the first quarter, giving a little bit more granularity and your expectation by the end of the year. Many thanks.

Stefano Venier

Okay. I'll start with the first about the output-based -- the output-based services. I mean the major contribution, as you pointed out, that came from the output based on storage services. And that was, of course, driven by the, let's say, good appetite the market showed for the reverse flow services and the flexibility we provide in the first quarter. So to that extent, we were ahead on our expectations, and we will drive this benefit to the end of the year. Of course, with respect to last year, we will have a lower contribution from the default services because, of course, this kind of service has squeezed over the year. Globally speaking, as we said, we expect to have a contribution in the region of EUR80 million, EUR90 million on full year. Now I'll turn to Luca for the international associates.

Luca Passa

Okay. Thanks, Stefano. When it comes to international associates. I mean, the first quarter performance, as I commented, it was a mix of better performance, I would say, across the board. And what we expect for the full year in terms of overall contribution of our associate portfolios in the region of EUR260 million in total, which a flat performance for our national associates, i.e., the domestic associates for about EUR90 million, which is in line with last year, while for our international activities, we expect a contribution in the region of EUR170 million. And here, I would say the positive surprise is mainly driven by the performance of Terega on the full year. We will expect basically a similar contribution from Terega vis-a-vis last year, also taking into account the new regulatory period, which started at the beginning of this year. When it comes to the regulatory review in Austria, as you know, we are currently waiting for the final decree from the regulator. What we can say there is that what has been already released for consultation regarding cost compensation for the two companies TAG and GCA is more or less in line with our expectation. And I would say about to be in line with our assumption in the business plan. You know that this effect will happen starting from 2025 and onwards so from next year for the period up until 2027. But until the final consultation is out, we cannot further comment in this respect, but I would say more or like in line with our expectation in the business plan. And then finally, when comes to ROSS effect, as I commented, the impact for the first quarter was EUR60 million. The expectation of the overall impact for the full year is in the region of EUR70 million in total. And clearly, this is based on our assumption when it comes to the percentages between slow money and fast money.

Operator

The next question is from Stefano Gamberini of Equita SIM.

Stefano Gamberini

Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first regarding the RAB deflator. The trend is weaker than expected, and it was around less 0.7% for the full year 2023, I'm clearly speaking about the gross fixed capital expenditure deflator versus the 1.6% that was included in the RAB deflator defined for 2024 at 5.9% by the regulator. So we are speaking of a difference that should be in the region of 600 basis points in 2023 on top of the around 350 basis points of difference towards the CPI in 2022. So do you think that the regulator can make some adjustment on the RAB deflator mechanism or how you can recover this difference? The second question regarding the trend of fixed costs during the first quarter. If I'm not wrong, your regulated revenues increased in the region of 22% in the same period, in this period and why such a significant growth. And finally, if you can repeat please, the targets -- sorry, the outcome that you expect in Austria, what could be the results from TAG and GCA from 2026 onwards. Thank you.

Stefano Venier

With respect to the deflator, I mean, we raised the point as -- along with the other, let's say, DSOs and TSOs to the authority. I think there will be a sort of discussion on this theme in the forthcoming months. We also have to take into consideration that there will be a review again by the National Institution for Statistics on the deflator mechanism in the forthcoming September. So by the end of the year, we will have much more clarity on the mechanism for the setting of the deflator going forward and backward. And second, it's going to be the position of the ARERA with respect to, let's say, possible adjustments on the mechanism of the deflator or so to have more alignment with the inflation, the CPI index. So I think there will be a discussion on this theme that is so important. With respect to the implications of the adjustment that happened in Q4 last year on 2024, I mean, with the fact that we increased our guidance means implicitly that we will offset entirely the reduction with respect to the former expectation we had for the year. Now I turn to Luca on the operating costs.

Luca Passa

Yes, Stefano.

Stefano Venier

I'll take that Austria question.

Luca Passa

Okay. On operating costs, I mean I commented the EUR6 million on labor cost, which was driven by the health insurance as well as labor inflation. There is another EUR6 million which had netted with the contribution of the Piombino FSRU. Basically, their revenues were EUR22 million. We posted a EUR16 million EBITDA contribution, which means that we had EUR6 million in cost. So the differential in terms of fee cost in total is 12%, 6% is the part of labor and 6% is the cost of the FSRU. And when it comes to the target also the expected outcome in Austria, I hand it over to Stefano.

Stefano Venier

Yes, as we said, I think the discussion that took place in the last month was primarily focused on we introducing a new mechanism for the tariff regulation. That means implicitly the, let's say, sterilization of the volume cyclicality. So we will be from 2025, fully protected from, let's say, volume change with respect to the allowed revenues. That I think it's a core milestone in the Austrian mechanism. And with respect to what we could expect from the new tariff scheme for the next three years, as Luca said, it's going to be in line with our expectations for 2025, 2026 and 2027. That means we will recover from the outcome of the last two years to have a positive net income in those operations.

Stefano Gamberini

Just a quick follow-up. I have understood correctly that as regarded the tariff were up for 2024 tariffs, you confirm that you apply this 5.9% because you didn't change your RAB reference hub. Am I wrong?

Stefano Venier

We applied -- I mean, as you know, the tariff will be -- have been submitted to the authority roughly a month ago. We replied in this stage to some questions they raised to us and will be finally approved by the end of July of this year. Of course, implicitly, the tariffs that will be approved will embed the new deflator that is going to be about 5.3% for the year.

Stefano Gamberini

Thank you.

Operator

The next question is from Marcin Wojtal of Bank of America in London.

Marcin Wojtal

Yes, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Firstly, what revisions to WACC do you expect in the Italian regulated business in 2025 based on current market rates? And secondly, I wanted to follow up on the guidance for the associates because I think if my calculation is correct, now you're indicating a reduction of EUR55 million versus 2023. But I think the previous indication was actually quite similar, it was around EUR60 million. So is it actually a material change in your expectations when it comes to international associates after this Q1? Or it's still -- it looks to me it's not very different to what it was before. Thank you.

Stefano Venier

Okay. Thanks, Marcin. When it comes to the WACC expectation. As you might recall, in the business plan, we have assumed for transport, which is the largest part, 5.7% in our business plan. Current interest rate point from mark-to-market, which is more close to 5.5%. There are still five months in the observation period that are missing, but that is current mark-to-market. Now that's a 20 basis point difference or lower vis-a-vis our business plan expectation. Clearly, lower interest rates also means for us, lower cost of debt expected. Therefore, we are planning to basically mitigate and absorb this delta when it comes to our contribution to EBITDA and then net income. Then when it comes to our associate. The guidance in terms of the contribution has improved. I mean, you pointed out correctly, we are assuming EUR55 million down currently vis-a-vis the full year 2023 in terms of contribution, but it is -- the reduction is smaller than actually what we reported or expected when we presented our full year results, which was in the region of EUR60 million to EUR70 million. So we actually are doing -- or expecting a EUR15 million to EUR20 million better performance from our international associates while the Italian ones are, as I said before, more or less in line at EUR90 million contribution.

Marcin Wojtal

Very clear. Thank you.

Operator

The next question is from Alberto de Antonio of BNP Paribas Exane.

Alberto de Antonio

Hi, good morning and thank you so much for taking my question. Just a follow-up on average cost of debt. Could you give us some guidance for the fiscal year '24 as you are expecting our financial expenses on your guidance. Thank you so much.

Stefano Venier

Thanks, Alberto. Our assumption for this guidance is a net cost of debt at the end of 2024 for the full year of 2.6% from the current, let's say, 2.4%. Clearly, what we will be working on, as you've probably seen also in the first part of this year is in trying to reduce basically this guidance. And let me say that I think we will have positive surprises here, but I can comment on this when we actually close the year. But the expectation is 2.6%.

Alberto de Antonio

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] the next question is a follow-up from Stefano Gamberini of Equita SIM.

Stefano Gamberini

Yes. Two quick questions, if I may. The first regarding the announcement of Italgas that submitted an offer for two years Italgas and the risk of a possible rights issue for closing the deal. Will you subscribe this capital increase in the case, it will be called? And the second, could you give us an update of the negotiation with Edison for Edison Stoccaggio? Thank you.

Stefano Venier

Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. With respect to Italgas, our stake, as you know, has been classified as opportunistic among our associates and is bound by a shareholder pact with CDP as well known. Such a shareholder pact allowed us to issue an exchangeable in September 2023 with the objective of lowering the cost of funding. If there will be a liquidity event like the capital increase, we will behave in line to such to the definition and the strategy I pointed out, and we will be looking at maintaining the same financial exposure to Italgas as we have today. With respect to Edison Stoccaggio, as you know, we had an exclusivity period that will end in June, and we are planning to submit our binding offer by June, and we are in the final phase of the due diligence.

Stefano Gamberini

Thanks.

Operator

The next question is from Davide Candela of Intesa Sanpaolo.

Davide Candela

Hi, good morning, gentlemen and thank you for taking my questions. Actually, just one. I was looking at the gas flows at Slide 4 and noticing that the LNG import were a little bit down year-on-year. And I was wondering if it is due to the little bit lower gas demand or in some way related to the issues, of course, that have been seen in the Middle East? And maybe more broadly on this point, if you can update on the situation about the transport of LNG to Italy? And which could be the balance if there would be maybe a drop in import, of course, if the geopolitical situation will negatively developed. Just a view from your side would be helpful. Thank you.

Stefano Venier

I think -- I mean the reason why the LNG in the first quarter was down is simply because we had a major maintenance event on the OLT floating vessel. At the end of February, we had to stop the operations and to bring the vessel to the dry dock for an extraordinary maintenance that will end by October, so to have back the unit in operation for the next winter. That's simply the reason because for the rest Piombino ran at full capacity, according to the slot, we received eight vessels in the first quarter as for planning and the same happened for the Adriatic LNG and Panigaglia. So the reason is simply because of the available capacity of the OLT. And we haven't seen any, let's say, effect from the closure of Suez channel for the LNG transport mainly from Qatar. So they took a longer journey through South Africa, but the deliveries happen regularly. With respect to the future -- possible future implication, I can't see short-term effects, again, with respect to the Suez channel performance. What I might see is a slight delay in the final investment decisions for the offshore development offshore Israel. That is -- and I'm referring to the fields of Aphrodite and Leviathan. Those were planned to be, let's say, was scheduled to take a decision by this year and probably it will be postponed just to see how the situation will evolve in that area. But that is the mid long-term possible effect. In the short term, we haven't seen neither on prices nor on deliveries, significant and tangible effects.

Davide Candela

Many thanks.

The next question is from Fernando Garcia of RBC.

Fernando Garcia

Hi, good morning. Just a clarification on previous comment regarding Italgas. When you say that you are going to maintain the stake you mean in percentage or in euro terms? Thank you.

The report breaks down the role of advanced nuclear technology to meet decarbonisation goals and notes that various regions and governments are including the technology in core policy objectives. The report also offers an overview of the trends and challenges that face the nuclear supply chain, spanning from extraction and processing to end-use applications and waste management.

CRA's report, titled: 'Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies: A Tailwind for Nuclear Energy Revival' further says: ""The renewed prominence of nuclear in the energy transition reflects the growing emphasis on energy security and decarbonization among policy makers. Alongside the repowering of existing nuclear plants, advanced nuclear technologies are now also under the spotlight as they hold the promise of shorter construction timelines, lower overhead costs, and cross-industry applications.""

The report highlights that given some of the biggest challenges to infrastructure investing are inflation and regulation, including permitting and licensing, taxation, and safety standards, investors require certainty.

Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at CRA and co-author of the report, points to the recent collapse of Nuscale's Idaho National Laboratory scheme as an example of the challenges advanced reactors face when considering deployment: ""The Nuscale news really does show how difficult it can be for developers to line up all the different components in the macro context of high inflation and high interest rates. If you are a developer that started back when the rates weren't what they are today, you are going to be hit by them even if you're grounded in the best technological positions.""

Kotak points to some relatively simple solutions though: ""In the first instance, the industry needs government support to drive projects forward in the first of a kind development. The industry would also benefit from a coherent regulatory framework that crosses borders.""

Indeed, Kotak tells NEI that alongside sustained policy support, a better regulatory framework is needed for advanced reactors to deliver on their potential: ""The technology can be mature, the customers can be ready and we are seeing a lot of market demand there, but having those government policy and regulatory markers to incentivise investment is still needed. The central mechanisms aren't yet in the place that they need to be to enable the advent and progression of advanced reactors.""

Nonetheless, she does pick up on some positive signs of change: ""There is an element of sharing on the fundamentals across borders. There have been some examples with the US and Canada in terms of exchanging learnings on the regulatory processes that they're undertaking.""

However, Kotak notes that much of the regulatory structure was developed around large conventional reactors that has a knock-on impact on, for example, how insurance products for small reactors are set up and delivered. This in turn has an impact on how the private sector perceives advanced reactors as an attractive investment prospect. ""The regulatory system needs to evolve as the products evolve; investors seem interested in the promise of advanced and small reactors relative to conventional, but it's very much hinged on policy sentiment."" Kotak highlights the Inflation Reduction Act rolled out earlier this year in the US as an example of positive sentiment that could serve as a model for wider advanced reactor deployment: ""The tax credits that we saw in the US with the IRA, has been very promising given the wave of new developments and progress that occurred as a result. Given the nascency of these new technologies, the role of government and the introduction of supportive policy has shown to be important in navigating the uncertainty that comes with innovation.

Kotak also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed if advanced reactors are to be deployed at scale. ""Whilst there are nuances across the different technologies, considerations do need to be made with regards to the supply chain, and labour and skills capacity. Public sentiment towards nuclear is also part of the challenge and needs to be overcome, given the benefits, and passive safety features, that small and advanced reactors bring relative to conventional designs.""

Indeed, the report argues that under certain circumstances, the economic viability of advanced nuclear technologies is notable, offering some advantages relative to other energy sources, including renewable and storage portfolios. This distinction is particularly noticeable at high levels of renewable penetration when contributions to capacity from renewables starts to decline.

Kotak adds: ""It's exciting that there are so many different options on the table and each have distinct points that they're working through, but equally opportunities to offset. Whilst there might be a supply chain obstacle for one design, it might also enable it to advance because of other factors that are impeding a different design get solved first.""

Advanced nuclear can also offer a more appealing proposition for off-takers or utility buyers, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), which considers the relative contribution of the technology to the electricity system in terms of energy, capacity and flexibility services.

The report notes that the case for additional advanced nuclear capacity is reinforced by the fact that long-term operation of nuclear power plants has the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) among all other technologies, including newly built solar and offshore wind. However, larger reactors often have extended construction timelines and conventional nuclear reactors (Generation I, II and III) typically feature high levels of fuel expenditure, with most of the construction activities occurring at the reactor site. As Kotak says: ""Advanced reactors such as the molten salts, the micro reactors, they're all being predicated on the fact that they're trying to offset the challenges that the large reactors bring for example trying to offset those cost overruns that appear to be inherent with traditional designs. Each has a USP and each of them is trying to target or offset a problem that has been in the industry and that's a positive.

A recently published report on behalf of EPRI and conducted by CRA titled, shows how across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, a first of a kind (FOAK) small modular reactor (SMR) has an overall average capital cost that is 16% less than a conventional light water reactor (LWR), primarily driven by lower financing costs resulting from shorter construction durations. This could ultimately result in lower total project costs for smaller reactors compared to their larger counterparts when considering both overnight and financing expenses.

Additionally, when integrated with thermal storage, advanced nuclear technologies can provide enhanced flexibility in the delivery of ancillary services, further underscoring their intrinsic advantages compared to conventional alternatives.

The report says that merits of advanced nuclear technologies present a strong case for potential investment opportunities. While external influences, such as government and industry, play a major role in de-risking investment, the role of the investor itself is critical in bridging the investment gap needed to enable the transition towards second-of-a-kind reactors and achieve commercial returns.

""There is an argument to say that it is not which design will win, but which one will be able to be deployed first. There's a variety of market policy and regulatory factors, skills factors, supply chain and fuel factors that must be addressed, but at the end of the day, you need that customer demand and you need the funding to be able to get it not just to first of a kind, but to commercial return, which requires Nth of a kind deployment. This is where the returns that make it economic can be seen. The industry needs enough funding for it to get to not just one, but perhaps four, seven, reactors that enable Nth of a kind projections. At this point, the economic benefits align and compound the otherwise existing inherent benefits of small reactors, such as the ability to power remote locations and offset grid infrastructure problems, and the modular construction and factory build approach that is poised to offset costs,"" she says.

The report highlights a number of examples of policies encouraging private sector engagement, noting for example, that Canada and the US have consistently supported nuclear as part of their energy mix. Both countries have extensive governmental backing for the advancement of nuclear technologies.

Canada's introduction of a clean technology investment tax credit of 30% explicitly focuses on SMR technology. Canada also recognises nuclear energy as a 'fundamental and necessary component' of the low-carbon energy system.

In addition, the development of SMRs is supported at both the national and provincial levels. The federal government released its SMR Roadmap in 2018 and SMR Action plan in 2020, supporting the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for various uses domestically and internationally. Canada's federal budget for 2023, announced in March, provided a 15% refundable investment tax credit for clean electricity, including nuclear. This credit is separate from the clean technology investment tax credit introduced in the 2022 federal budget, which provided a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. On March 28, 2022, the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta released a plan outlining a path forward for SMRs as a deliverable under the provincial SMR memorandum of understanding (MoU). Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Bruce Power, New Brunswick Power and SaskPower have been working collectively to develop three streams of SMR project proposals. On September 21, 2023, the province of Alberta announced the allocation of US$5m in funding (C$7m) towards a multi-year research initiative aimed at assessing the techno-economic feasibility, as well as considerations for safety behind implementing SMRs within oil sands operations.

As Kotak says: ""Such policy measures would give confidence to investors that this is a technology that we are going to support and it is not going to be dropped and lose your investment. Similar to what was done with wind and solar. It's only at the price it is today because of that level of support to drive innovation and driving new supply chains. Private investment has come in now because of the amount of subsidies that went into it from the outset.""

The report also emphasises the growing role of the private sector, noting that in July 2023, OPG announced its collaboration with the provincial government to plan and license three additional SMRs, for a total of four SMRs at OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project.

Earlier in January, OPG, GEH, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed the first commercial contract for a grid-scale SMR in North America. The six-year partnership seeks to finalise the construction of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Darlington site by the end of 2028, with plans to commence power supply to the grid in 2029. This comes in the wake of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank commitment of US$713m (C$970), announced in October 2022, to finance the first phase of OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project. In 2021, OPG selected GEH's BWRX-300 SMR for the project.

Kotak picks up on these developments: ""It's great to see different vendor-utility or customer partnerships that are driving for clusters or multiples of reactor units that still reach the required output.""

The report notes that Europe is also seeing both public and private sector engagement, highlighting that the market is divided in its views on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and Lithuania, have phased out nuclear power; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal signed a joint declaration, opposing the inclusion of nuclear in the EU Green finance taxonomy. In contrast, France, the European leader in nuclear power, has brought together a 'Nuclear Alliance' consisting of 11 countries. This alliance will work towards strengthening cooperation in nuclear energy as an important component of Europe's energy goals.

In a bid to cement its leadership in civilian nuclear energy, France, in 2022, announced its plans to build six new next-generation nuclear reactors by 2050, with a possibility of deploying an additional eight. This plan was catalysed by Parliament's recent approval of the Government's nuclear investment plan, allocating €52bn to the construction of new reactors. While the project work is yet to begin, EDF Energy plans to commission its first two facilities in 2035 and a third in 2040. France's ambition to deploy its first SMR by 2030 contributes to the government vision for nuclear to account for more than 50% of the country's electricity mix.

The report further notes that in Poland, energy-intensive companies such as Synthos and PKN Orlen, established a joint venture to deploy an SMR fleet, GEH's BWRX-300. In addition, ENEA Group, one of the largest power companies in Poland, is collaborating with Last Energy to develop SMRs.

Other countries, including UK, Romania and the Czech Republic that have historically been dependent on coal to meet their energy needs, are increasingly turning to advanced nuclear technologies as a means of decarbonising their energy systems.

""We're seeing the private sector engage in Eastern Europe, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, with high-wealth individuals exploring options with small and advanced reactors. Bill Gates' TerraPower has shown what private investment can do to propel a new reactor design,"" says Kotak.

Kotak also points to a broader economic benefit to those nations that do successfully deploy advanced reactor technology: ""Once that first of a kind small reactor is identified and can be commercially developed, there could be significant export potential for a market."" She adds: ""The timeliness, limitations and opportunities of all clean energy resources - nuclear, CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal - need to be considered.""

The report says that the nuclear energy sector challenge is exacerbated by the imminent retirement of the current nuclear workforce. A multi-year, multi-unit build-up of nuclear reactors will require addressing the labour shortage at various stages, including education, recruitment for entry-level positions and the identification of highly skilled master tradespeople.

""From a vendor developer perspective, business models are set up with the intention to build more than one reactor, given the level of infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and people required. The repeatability is the USP. If the modular construction, factory build, and ability to just repeat orders isn't taken up on, it could miss a key opportunity. The report notes that designs are planned for modules to be built at factories and then transported to the main reactor site, reducing the total construction time required. Microreactors take this concept a step further and are designed such that the entire reactor can be transported at once,"" says Kotak.

Nonetheless, Kotak is optimistic, she says: ""Advanced nuclear technology could play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of our energy systems. I am positive because fundamentally, regardless of what design gets chosen, it has a role to play as a clean energy source, and to enable the pathway to net zero. I think, ultimately, we need to be reminded that all COP nations or signatories have all signed up to this to reduce emissions and to reach those net zero goals."" As Kotak concludes: ""As the costs become more secure, the investment returns become more clear and that regulatory and policy structures are in place to give that confirmation of returns, I think we will see more private investment, as we've seen with other energy sources.""",neimagazine.com,news,Nuclear Engineering International,,0.3333333333333333,453699639,10,https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/Double_Unit_2_8K_1440x810.webp,eng-9584248

But when President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hosted Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Ankara this week, it was almost a routine talk between neighbours.

The meeting was their fourth in 10 months as the two leaders try to put an end to decades of mutual animosity by focusing on trade, tourism, energy and repairing cultural ties, among other areas.

""In the critical area of migration, the cooperation between our two countries and especially between the police and the coast guard is paying off against illegal flows and against the wretched traffickers, who take advantage of desperate people's pain,"" said Mitsotakis in a common press conference.

""This cooperation must continue and be intensified.""

There are still areas where both sides have agreed to disagree, but it's good to see one old trouble spot in Europe sort of fading, especially as another trouble spot reignited big time this week.

Thousands of protesters in Georgia rallied near the parliament building in Tbilisi - again - just hours after lawmakers gave the final approval to the controversial foreign influence law, modelled on a Russian version passed more than a decade earlier.

Lawmakers passed the law despite EU warnings that it would undermine Georgia's path to EU membership.

Yet, the official reaction in Brussels was muted.

Speaking in Denmark, EU Council President Charles Michel said: ""I had a phone call a few days ago with the Prime Minister and I told him that I am disappointed and that I sincerely hope that Georgia will find a way to stick to the democratic principles and also meet the expectations of the population.""

Meanwhile, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released its latest economic outlook. The numbers for Georgia, which is part of the area where the EBRD operates, were rather sobering.

In general, the forecast also contained some encouraging news.

To learn more, we spoke to Beata Javorcik, chief economist of the EBRD.

Euronews: So, your latest report is appropriately called ""Taming Inflation"" - and when I look at the numbers, inflation in the EBRD regions came down from a peak in October 2022 of 17.5 percent to an average of 6.3 percent last March. Explain that number for us, what is behind such a huge drop?

Javorcik: What has helped bring the inflation down was to a large extent, the developments in the international markets. We have seen a sharp drop in the prices of natural gas in Europe, declines in prices of agricultural commodities, and oil prices have remained moderate. But, of course, inflation in our regions of operations still remains above the level before the pandemic, as is the case in advanced economies.

Euronews: Can you breathe a sigh of relief now or are there still important inflation risks remaining?

Javorcik: Not all central bankers can consider their job done. If you look at cumulative inflation, that is inflation since February 2022 up until now, it has exceeded 30% in several countries. Notably in Egypt, in Turkey, in Hungary and Kazakhstan, Moldova and Ukraine. So, that means that in the absence of wage increases, people in those countries would have lost a third of their purchasing power.

Euronews: Let's talk about the growth outlook in the EBRD's EU regions - do you see positive signs going forward?

Javorcik: This year is going to be much better than last year for the Eastern European EU member states, in particular Poland and Croatia, stand out with expected growth of 3%. Hungary will do well, too. We see real wages increasing. We see fiscal policy helping out and the EU funding, the New Generation EU, also stimulating economic activity.

Euronews: I can't release you without a word on Ukraine. How is their economy doing in the third year of the war?

Javorcik: The heavy bombings in the last two months mean that the ability of Ukraine to generate electricity has been severely diminished. Electricity production is at 40% of what it used to be before the bombings. And this capacity cannot be easily repaired.

Looking for something fun to do over the weekend?

How about jumping from a helicopter at 3,000 feet high, diving down to 35 metres above the River Thames and then soaring through London's Tower Bridge only to rise up again to 80 metres, the height required to open the parachute before landing safely?

This is a complex James-Bond-like manoeuvre known among insiders as a ""flare"".

And this coming from veteran skydivers with more than 22,000 jumps under their belt...

Vladimir Putin is seeking to weaponise the threat of mass migration to divide and weaken Europe as supporters of Ukraine battle to maintain unity to defeat Russia, Kaja Kallas, the Estonian prime minister said on Friday.

""What our adversaries know is migration is our vulnerability,"" she said. 'The aim is to make life really impossible in Ukraine so that there would be migration pressure to Europe, and this is what they are doing"".

She said Russia had already created the migration pressure through disruption in Syria and in Africa via the Wagner group.

""I think we have to understand that Russia is weaponising migration. Our adversaries are weaponising migration.

""They push the migrants over the border, and they create problems for the Europeans because they weaponise this since with human rights, you have to accept those people. And that is, of course, water to the mill of the far right.""

Kallas was speaking at a briefing in Tallinn in which she admitted the plight of the Ukrainians on the front was ""very serious"" and European promises of extra weapons had not been delivered, something that could be rectified by Nato taking charge of the coordination of weapon delivery. ""The problem is that our promises do not save lives"", she said.

Kallas is one of many European politicians trying to spell out the many negative consequences to Europe of a Ukrainian defeat, and rebut those that claim such a reverse can be somehow contained.

She was speaking in Tallinn the day after the former Estonian president Toomas Ilves predicted that if Ukraine fell into Russian hands as many as 30 million Ukrainians would seek to flee. ""That is the threat we face due to our inaction,"" he said, pointing out that Europe had a ""complete meltdown"" when faced with two million refugees from the Middle East in 2015.

A pamphlet produced by pro-Ukrainian NGOs have detailed how Russian shelling between October 2022 and January 2023 led to an increase in migration out of Ukraine a quarter higher than the previous year.

The recent round of attacks have targeted electricity generation rather than transmission. Olena Halushka, Board head at the international centre for a Ukrainian Victory said: ""Right now they are trying to bomb Ukraine into the stone age,"" adding that in the past two months more damage has been inflicted than the whole of the winter of 2023. She said: ""Europe needs to think about Kharkiv, a city the size of Munich, without energy this winter and then think about the financial implications of tens of millions of Ukrainians fleeing the war due to fear of occupation"".

Kallas said Russian assaults are now targeting Ukrainian cities every day and every night.

She conceded that, based on geography and history, some countries in Europe did not see the threat of a Ukrainian defeat in the same way. ""They don't see and they don't believe that if Ukraine falls Europe is in danger, the whole of Europe, maybe some countries, but not the whole of Europe"".

She said she feared a mistake was being made similar to the late 1930s, when linked conflicts were being seen as isolated events. Tipped as a possible successor to Josep Borrell as EU high commissioner for foreign policy, Kallas cited links between the conflicts in Azerbaijan and Armenia, the Middle East, and the South China Sea. She said the same error was made in the 1930s about the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the German occupation of Austria and the Sino-Japanese war.

""The lesson from 1938 and 1939 is that if aggression pays off somewhere, it will be taken up elsewhere. Ukraine's defeat is something all aggressors will learn from. They will learn that in 2024, bluntly, you can just colonise another country and nothing happens to you.""

She pointed to what she described as baby steps to strengthening the European defence architecture, including a European defence fund, the increase in individual nation state defence spending and the proposal for a shared defence debt bond to boost spending. She denied Estonia had had any serious discussions about sending troops to Ukraine, while arguing at the same time it is better if Putin kept guessing about Europe's plans.

She said it was also a valid criticism that Ukraine was not moving fast enough to mobilise more troops.",theguardian.com,news,The Guardian,Patrick Wintour,-0.2705882352941177,453652388,1,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8fcbe25bbabaa2ca90b63cbcd009332c8eb9acb/847_525_3724_2235/master/3724.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c5c0651704fc74d724eddf1ee8cf414d,eng-9580010

The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

This information comes from data on quarterly estimates for greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity published by Eurostat today. Quarterly estimates of greenhouse gas emissions complement quarterly socio-economic data, such as GDP or employment. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained article on quarterly greenhouse gas emissions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2%) and manufacturing (-3.1%). Emissions by households remained almost stable.

Greenhouse gas emissions down in 22 EU countries

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23.0%), Bulgaria (-17.0%) and Finland (-9.0%).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg). Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions. The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP.

This SFCR has been prepared based on the EU Directive 2009/138/EC and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35.

VIG Insurance Group, together with its individual companies, is the leading insurance group in Austria and the CEE region. Wiener Städtische Wechselseitiger Versicherungsverein - Vermögensverwaltung - Vienna Insurance Group (WSTW) is the majority shareholder owning around 70% of VIG Insurance Group.

In 2018, a notice from the competent supervisory authority, the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA), removed WSTW from its supervision of the Group, so that supervision of the Group is now performed at the level of VIG Holding. This SFCR reports on the solvency and financial condition of VIG Insurance Group in accordance with this decision and the legal requirements.

Chapter A presents business activities and performance. The Group is based in Vienna and with its insurance companies is the leading insurance group in Austria and the CEE region.

In 2023, VIG Insurance Group generated a premium volume in non-life business of TEUR 8,120,877 (2022: TEUR 7,173,003).

The total premium volume in life insurance business was TEUR 4,146,510 in 2023 (2022: TEUR 4,193,019). The total capital investment result in 2023 amounted to TEUR 284,255.

Due to interest rate developments on the capital market, on 21 April 2023 VIG Holding prematurely repurchased a portion of the subordinated bond from 2015, with the repurchase rate amounting to around 46% (EUR 185.6 million) of the original total nominal amount (EUR 400 million). The outstanding volume of the subordinated bond from 2015 in the amount of EUR 214.4 million can be called for the first time in March 2026.

With effect from 9 October 2023, VIG Holding called the outstanding volume of EUR 284.4 million of the subordinated bond from 2013.

The purchase agreement that was concluded on 29 November 2020 for the VIG Group acquisition of the companies of the Dutch company Aegon N.V. in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Türkiye has been successfully closed. The VIG Group finalised the acquisition of the Hungarian Aegon companies in March 2022. Consequently, the Hungarian state holding Corvinus holds a 45% stake in Aegon Hungary. The acquisition of the Turkish AEGON insurance company was closed in April 2022 and the acquisition of the Aegon companies in Poland and Romania was also completed in May 2023. The Aegon companies in Poland and Romania were not yet consolidated as of 31 December 2023.

On 30 November 2023, VIG increased its indirect participation in the Hungarian ALFA insurance company (formerly AEGON) and UNION insurance company from 55% to 90%. The Hungarian government retains its 10% stake in the Hungarian business via the state-owned holding company Corvinus.

In June 2023, the Czech company Global Assistance CZ implemented a pilot project in Croatia and, in collaboration with Frantisek Paum, owner of PAME-AUTO s.r.o., established Global Assistance Croatia, which will offer its customers car assistance services in Croatia, particularly during the summer. This means VIG Insurance Group now has nine assistance companies that provide customer support and service in twelve countries.

This SFCR has been prepared based on the EU Directive 2009/138/EC and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35.

VIG Holding, together with its individual companies, is the leading insurance group in Austria and the CEE region. Wiener Städtische Wechselseitiger Versicherungsverein - Vermögensverwaltung - Vienna Insurance Group (WSTW) is the main shareholder of Vienna Insurance Group AG Wiener Versicherung Gruppe with a share of 70%.

This report on the solvency and financial condition of VIG Holding as a solo company is in accordance with the legal requirements. The regulatory solvency and financial condition report for VIG Insurance Group is available on the VIG Holding website (www.vig.com).

Chapter A presents the business activities and performance of VIG Holding. VIG Holding's main activity is managing its insurance companies. VIG Holding also operates as an insurer and reinsurer, dealing with the international corporate and large customer business and mainly acting as an international reinsurance company for its subsidiaries.

In 2023, VIG Holding generated a premium volume before reinsurance of TEUR 1,669,758 (2022: TEUR 1,499,318). The

underwriting result in accordance with UGB/VAG was TEUR 32,298 (2022: TEUR 48,124). The combined ratio is a key figure used in property and casualty insurance and defined as the ratio of administrative expenses and claim payments to net earned premiums. VIG Holding had a ratio of 101.2% in 2023 (2022: 98.7%) net (after deduction of reinsurance portions), which is over 100% due to the combined ratio of the indirect business.

Due to interest rate developments on the capital market, on 21 April 2023 VIG Holding prematurely repurchased a portion of the subordinated bond from 2015, with the repurchase rate amounting to around 46% (EUR 185.6 million) of the original total nominal amount (EUR 400 million). The outstanding volume of the subordinated bond from 2015 in the amount of EUR 214.4 million can be called for the first time in March 2026.

With effect from 9 October 2023, VIG Holding called the outstanding volume of EUR 284.4 million of the subordinated bond from 2013.

The purchase agreement that was concluded on 29 November 2020 for the VIG Group acquisition of the companies of the Dutch company Aegon N.V. in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Türkiye has been successfully closed. The VIG Group finalised the acquisition of the Hungarian Aegon companies in March 2022. Consequently, the Hungarian state holding Corvinus holds a 45% stake in Aegon Hungary. The acquisition of the Turkish AEGON insurance company was closed in April 2022 and the acquisition of the Aegon companies in Poland and Romania was also completed in May 2023.

On 30 November 2023, VIG increased its indirect participation in the Hungarian ALFA insurance company (formerly AEGON) and UNION insurance company from 55% to 90%. The Hungarian government retains its 10% stake in the Hungarian business via the state-owned holding company Corvinus.

In June 2023, the Czech company Global Assistance CZ implemented a pilot project in Croatia and, in collaboration with Frantisek Paum, owner of PAME-AUTO s.r.o., established Global Assistance Croatia, which will offer its customers car assistance services in Croatia, particularly during the summer. This means VIG Insurance Group now has nine assistance companies that provide customer support and service in twelve countries.

Ghent-based Companion.energy, a startup specialising in energy software for industrial enterprises, has secured €2.1M in funding from investors, including Übermorgen Ventures and Cavalry Ventures.

Entourage, led by Pieterjan Bouten, and Imec.istart Future Fund also participated in this round.

The proceeds will help Companion.energy assist European industries in transitioning to sustainability while managing energy expenses effectively. ""The need is high: there is a lot of potential for a frontrunner like us,"" says Thomas Vyncke, co-founder of Companion.energy.

Pieterjan Bouten of Entourage adds, ""Thomas and Jonas are pioneers with a vision to create software products for the pressing challenge that industrial companies face in combining their financial and technological needs.""

""With Companion.energy, these companies can control their own energy demand. Thus, Companion.energy has all the potential to become an international player.""

Companion.energy addresses the challenges faced by industrial companies dealing with energy price fluctuations due to the rise of renewables and shifting to electric alternatives.

The company's platform utilises machine learning to analyse energy contracts and operational data, enabling real-time control over energy demand.

By accurately predicting energy needs and costs, Companion.energy facilitates cost savings and supports sustainability goals for industrial players.

Jonas Verstraeten, co-founder of Companion.energy, says, ""Energy prices for most large consumers don't change just once a day but continuously.""

""With our software, we help companies reduce energy costs during times of abundance, such as sunny periods or when there is a lot of wind. This is comparable to a household where the washing machine runs at night to benefit from a cheaper night rate.""

Co-founder Vyncke, adds, ""We offer two advantages: sustainability and cost savings. We prove that sustainability doesn't always mean that energy becomes more expensive.""

Smart Energy Europe's research highlights the potential of demand-side flexibility in the energy sector. By 2030, it could save tens of billions of euros and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37.5 million tons annually, representing an 8 per cent decrease.

Companion.energy was founded in 2022 by two Belgian engineers with expertise in energy, Thomas Vyncke and Jonas Verstraeten. The company aims to accelerate the Net Zero journey of large energy-consuming companies.

The company's software translates each customer's operational context and contract mix into a precise energy model, generating optimisation signals for flexible energy asset management. This helps customers to reduce energy costs, stabilise cost fluctuations, and cut energy-related emissions.

Companion.energy claims that it enables industrial players to save 10-30 per cent on electricity costs on average.

Co-founder Vyncke says, ""Our product, at the intersection of financial and technological needs for energy demand management, comes at the right time. There is currently a high demand among industrial players in Europe to remain competitive, and energy cost is a significant factor in that.""

""As pioneers in this field, there are plenty of opportunities for us. That's also the reason why we're raising external capital: we feel that we need to act now.""

""This need is not only present in Belgium but internationally as well. That's why we were able to convince investors, both domestic and international, to invest in Companion.energy,"" adds co-founder Verstraeten.

Despite being in its early stages, Companion.energy's platform has already secured clients such as Proximus in Belgium, Equans in the Netherlands, and VERBUND in Austria.

Übermorgen Ventures specialises in energy tech and climate transition, and Cavalry Ventures is known for investments in B2B software.

Alexander Langguth, Partner at Übermorgen Ventures, says, ""Companion.energy has the innovative spirit needed to drive the climate transition forward. Their approach not only promises significant cost reductions for industrial players but also aligns perfectly with our mission as investors to support technologies that can substantially mitigate environmental impacts.""

""As the industry transitions to more renewable energy use, we believe Companion.energy's software will play a crucial role in facilitating a smooth transition to renewable energy sources.""

Björn Loose, Partner at Cavalry Ventures, adds, ""At Cavalry, we recognise the critical intersection between innovation and pragmatism in software solutions that address significant industry challenges.""

""Companion.energy's product offers a compelling example of how advanced technology can be deployed efficiently to better manage energy consumption. This investment underscores our commitment to backing startups that are building software products to make a measurable difference in sustainability for large enterprises.""",siliconcanals.com,news,Silicon Canals,,0.388235294117647,453640197,1,https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Companiondotenergys-co-founders-Thomas-Vyncke-and-Jonas-Verstraeten-Image-credit-Companiondotenergy-1024x536.jpg,eng-9576884

The continent's green energy transition and how to finance it were among the topics on the agenda.

More than 300 participants representing over 30 countries took part in the 17th edition of the German-African Energy Forum, held in Hamburg on May 16 and 17.

Wiebke Polomka, senior manager of Southern Africa of Afrika-Verein der deutschen Wirtschaft, which organized the forum, told pv magazine that German companies have the technology, knowledge and experience to support Africa's transition.

""I think we can go even further from here, we need to encourage even more companies to take a look at Africa because it has huge potential for renewable energy and everyone is looking for partners,"" she added.

As this year's theme - ""Africa's energy roadmap: Breaking new grounds for green(er) economies"" - would indicate, the continent's green energy transition was at the forefront of many conversations. In an introductory video call, African Union's Commissioner for Infrastructure, Energy, ICT and Tourism, Dr. Amani Abou-Zeid, said that maximizing Africa's renewables deployment is a ""must."" She set out targets of 800 GW of renewables by 2040, including a 20-fold increase in solar.

Nthato Minyuku, Siemens Energy's head of government affairs for Africa, told attendees that African countries need time, space and funding for the energy transition. She added that ""radical solutions are not the answer to radical problems."" Several speakers said that every country will have different ways and different paces toward the energy transition. For some, that will include the continued use of gas as a transitional energy source.

In a session debating the roadmap to greener industrialization, the panelists said that African countries need to ""be more honest with themselves"" and introduce incentives and frameworks to create conducive environments for foreign investors. Ezekiel Adesina, executive secretary of the African Energy Study Group, Nigeria, called for international cooperation across the continent. His calls were echoed by Senegalese Minister of Energy Birame Souléye Diop, who said that neighboring countries don't want to have to compete with each other and should rather look to support to one another.

The participants said that energy projects in Africa can be up to two or three times more expensive than comparable projects in advanced economies, leading to discussions around whether finance instruments need to be adapted or reconsidered. While it was made clear at the forum that German public funding will continue to play a role, the onus was put on the private sector.

Birgit Pickel, director general Africa for Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), said that the private sector ""has to do the job."" She explained that the ministry aims to bring in more investment. BMZ currently holds 33 bilateral partnerships across Africa, tailor-made to each country, with a focus on delivering the lowest-cost renewables as energy alternatives.

The panelists noted investment risks but highlighted the direct correlation between risks and opportunities. One session on financing energy transition urged investors to engage with local companies once projects begin in Africa, as it de-risks projects while also putting less pressure on importation and in turn less reliance on the dollar.

Throughout the forum, hydrogen was never too far from the discussion. In one session dedicated entirely to the technology, where it was billed as the ""energy of the future,"" the focus was on harnessing green hydrogen for local use in African industries. In particular, Sven Schuppener, an associate expert for UNIDO Austria, gave advice for African countries looking to develop the technology.

""It might sound counterintuitive at first, but what makes sense for most countries, is to start small,"" Schuppener said, adding that donor funding is often available for small-scale projects.

Markhus Thill, president region Africa at Robert Bosch, agreed, adding that hydrogen projects aimed at benefiting the local sector will in turn foster industrialization and job creation.

And while Germany's long-term goal of exporting hydrogen from Africa to Europe was mentioned - particularly the potential for doing so from North African countries where pipelines already exist - several attendees shared the opinion that African countries need to work toward universal electricity access and less reliance on imports before considering additional exports.

German companies can rest assured that African nations are ready and waiting for investment. Multiple speakers across several sessions said there were representatives in the room ready to start the conversation.

Adesina urged often ""risk-averse"" German investors to visit the African countries they are looking to invest in. He said Chinese companies are currently taking the space, as African companies are looking to sign what comes to the table.

Present during the reception was a representative of His Majesty King Mswati III, Prince Senzangakhona, the Deputy Prime Minister, Thuli Dladla, Cabinet Ministers, government officials and civil society members.

Speaking during the reception, EU Ambassador to Eswatini, Dessislava Choumelova, said Europe Day was an opportunity to celebrate the EU's many achievements including its role as a major global actor greatly contributing to peace, stability and sustainable growth around the world over the last 74 years.

Ambassador Choumelova said the EU itself, born in the ashes of war as a peace project, has today gone a long way to achieve peace, unity and prosperity in Europe. She said the EU, together with its 27 Member States, was working to improve the lives of European citizens and of people around the world.

The Ambassador said the EU dedicates around 10% of its budget to external action and said this stems from the EU's will to contribute to global development, help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

In Eswatini, Ambassador Choumelova said for over 50 years, the EU has been a major and reliable partner of the Kingdom's development initiatives. She said the EU has contributed billions of Emalangeni (Eswatini currency) to help the country improve access to clean and potable water, electricity, free primary education, health (including access to vaccines), sustainable and climate-smart agriculture, infrastructure development, strengthening of governance, democracy and human rights, social protection, disaster risk management, institutional capacity building and trade facilitation.

Earlier, during the inauguration of the EU Book Corner, The EU Delegation also helped to launch a local book authored by a local hip-hop artist, Thamsanqa ""Krtc"" Sibandze. Titled ""The 10 Pillars of Artistic Mastery"", the book provides much needed guidance for aspiring and young artists on the path towards artistic growth and mastery for greatness.

In her speech during the launch, Ambassador Choumelova said the value of culture and education was reflected in the EU moto 'United in Diversity'. She said the moto illustrates how Europeans have come together, in the form of the EU, to work for peace and prosperity for European citizens.

The Ambassador said for Europe, art and culture are freedom - freedom to create and express, to share and connect and to broaden horizons.

She was grateful for the partnership with the National Library, which has seen the launch of the EU Book Corner. EU Member States - Austria, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Sweden provided the books for the Corner.

Dieter Schmalstieg, Alexander von Humboldt Professor of Visual Computing at the University of Stuttgart, has been awarded the Humboldt Professorship. Germany's most prestigious international research award was awarded to top researchers who have chosen to join German universities from abroad. Schmalstieg is working on augmented reality projects - with the aim of making people's lives easier.

""The Humboldt Professorship is a great honor and source of motivation,"" says computer scientist Dieter Schmalstieg, who was presented with the Humboldt Professorship award by Bettina Stark-Watzinger, Federal Minister of Education and Research; and Robert Schlögl, President of the Humboldt Foundation, in Berlin on 13 May 2024. In fall 2023, he moved from Graz University of Technology to the VISUS Visualization Research Center at the University of Stuttgart. According to Schmalstieg, the department offers excellent working conditions and is a beacon in the research landscape. He was already familiar with VISUS before moving to Stuttgart, from joint projects with the institute's founder Thomas Ertl. ""That's how I knew I would fit in very well here,"" he remarks.

Schmalstieg is one of the world's leading experts in the field of visualization, the visualization of digital information. What motivates him? ""My aim is to provide people with better access to information. I want to make computer technology easier to use, more varied, more exciting, and more rewarding.

3D instead of 2D

To this end, he is developing augmented reality technologies for smart glasses. Unlike virtual reality, where you are completely immersed in virtual worlds, augmented reality (AR) means that virtual elements are projected into the real environment. Schmalstieg has been working on this ""augmented reality"" for almost 30 years.

The researcher believes that AR glasses could shape everyday life in the future in the same way that smartphones do today. ""We're all constantly staring at these small screens. But cell phones are very limited when it comes to making information accessible."" Take online shopping, for example. If someone wants to buy a cushion cover for their sofa, they can turn the product around on the screen and enlarge it. Or they alternate between looking at the real sofa and the virtual object and try to imagine whether the two fit together. But the spatial context is missing: The virtual cushion placed as a 3D object on the real sofa. This leap into three-dimensional viewing can be achieved using AR glasses. ""They offer a higher quality, more comprehensible user experience than cell phones - simply because objects that are best displayed spatially can be viewed in this way.""

The Humboldt professor is currently working on an AR application that helps with assembling pieces of furniture, such as chests of drawers. If you are careless and twist the boards by 180 degrees, the drill holes no longer fit - everything has to be unscrewed again. The application is specifically designed to detect such errors, ensuring they're caught early - this makes life a lot easier, says Schmalstieg.

AR as a problem solver - even for future construction practices

When is an AR application good? When virtual reality merges with the real environment in such a way that it seems to belong there. This photorealism is known from special effects in films. However, Schmalstieg highlights an increased necessity for research aimed at enhancing information comprehensibility. This is about problems that cannot be solved by simply looking at something. On construction sites, for example, AR glasses can provide valuable services by rendering visible what would otherwise remain unseen to the naked eye. They can show where cables run in the wall or ceiling and whether electricity is flowing through them. Or they display virtual safety lines that must not be crossed.

Schmalstieg will work in the Cluster of Excellence ""Integrative Computational Design and Construction for Architecture"" (IntCDC) at the University of Stuttgart, where he will develop an AR application for robot-assisted house construction. Building designs are becoming increasingly complex; new timber construction techniques, for example, require a very high degree of precision, explains the researcher. Humans are becoming more and more dependent on the cooperation of robots - and this is exactly where AR smart glasses come into play. ""When humans and robots work together, good coordination is required. Humans must understand what the robot is doing, and vice versa. AR smart glasses excel in facilitating this human-machine interaction. They provide information about everything important that is happening on the construction site.""

Schmalstieg wants his applications to help people cope better with everyday life and work. ""I am not responsible for assessing technological impact. But because I'm dealing with human-machine interfaces, I must also consider what role humans play in the equation. Whether the technology I develop has a certain value.""

Uncomfortable devices

What happens next? AR and virtual reality have existed as business models for several years and tech companies have been marketing smart glasses for over a decade. Are they on the edge of a breakthrough? Schmalstieg believes that, sooner or later, ""radical change"" will come. ""Then it will be normal to wear smart glasses. After all, we all want to access mobile information at any time. In the long term, cell phones won't be able to keep up with smart glasses."" However, for these technologies to truly permeate everyday life, they must also be affordable, lightweight, and convenient. There is still a lot of work to do, says the Humboldt professor. Some of the current devices are a little heavy on the nose.

Other European countries are on the same path towards economic suicide. Here is their GDP growth in Q1 2023, Q4 2023, and Q1 2024, respectively: Germany: 0.1%, -0.2%, -0.2%; the UK: -0.3%, -0.2%, 0.2%; Italy: 2.2%, 0.7%, 0.6%; France: 0.8%, 1.1%, 1.1%; Ireland: 1.1%, -8.7%, -0.8%; Sweden: 1.7%, -0.2%, -1.1%; and Austria: 1.8%, -1.4%, -1.3%.

Germany shut down its last nuclear power plant in April 2023 while it reduced its number of coal plants. So, it must now rely on domestic intermittent wind-solar power plus import nuclear power from France, Belgium, and Sweden to avoid blackouts.

Economic growth and security is better assured if there is energy security. Nuclear power has been an old, proven reliable energy source since the 1950s in Europe and the US. Now Europeans that started with high nuclear capacity and have ""denuclearized,"" like Germany and the UK, are suffering from low growth if not degrowth. Meanwhile Asian countries that ramped up their nuclear power capacity are enjoying faster growth, like China, South Korea, and India (see Table 1).

I like this observation made by Lino Bernardo, Head of Energy Transition Projects of Aboitiz Power, and among my fellow travelers from government, corporate, and local media, on the Philippines Nuclear Trade Mission to Canada last March. He said, ""A national nuclear energy program can only take off once clear policies have been laid and a regulatory regime is enforced. Nuclear power has high-capacity factor and long asset life but [is] paired with high upfront capital costs. The costs of emerging nuclear technologies must come down before it becomes commercially feasible for developing countries like the Philippines, making its adoption more later than sooner. Building nuclear energy assets requires flawless execution, holistic planning from commissioning to decommissioning, and preparations on human capital development must begin as soon as possible.""

MERALCO FRANCHISE RENEWAL

House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Joey Salceda made a good observation that ""The case for renewing Meralco's franchise is plain and simple: it has complied with the conditions of the franchise law and it is good for the economy and the consumer... At least 29 municipalities and cities and at least four provinces outside the franchise area have formally expressed interest to be served by Meralco."" See BusinessWorld's report this week, ""Lawmaker bats for Meralco service expansion, cites economic benefits"" (May 14).

The Meralco franchise area covers the whole of the National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila, the five provinces of Calabarzon (the whole of Cavite and Rizal, and portions of Batangas, Laguna, and Quezon), and parts of the Central Luzon region (the whole of Bulacan and parts of Pampanga).

I checked the regional breakdown of the Philippines' GDP. The Meralco franchise area covers the top three largest economic regions of the country. Since energy is development, by assuring energy security in these areas, the company has assured their economic security. Notice the faster growth of the NCR over the national GDP in the 2003-2009 period, and faster growth of Calabarzon and Central Luzon than the national GDP in the 2010-2023 period (see Table 2).

I am from Negros Occidental. There are five electric cooperatives (ECs) there, plus three ECs in neighboring Negros Oriental, for a total of eight ECs in a single island, eight legislative franchise laws from Congress, and eight entities to be monitored by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) and the public.

That Meralco delivers the efficient distribution of electricity with minimal blackouts compared to many provinces in the country should be taken by Congress as a model to consolidate those eight ECs in our island into one franchise to be administered by experienced corporate distribution utilities.

COAL AS WORKHORSE VS BLACKOUT

I read about some groups blaming coal plants as the ""cause"" of the frequent yellow-red alerts in the Philippines, especially during the hot months of March to April. Far out! They are churning out fake news. Data from the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP) shows that it was precisely coal power that saved the country from potential horrible blackouts this year and previous years, contributing 62% to 65% of total power generation in 2023 and 2024 (see Table 3).

But since only ""brownfield"" coal investments are now allowed in the Philippines, and the existing gas plants will not be sufficient to provide additional large increases in power supply in the coming years, we have to consider the use of nuclear energy in the country, from reviving or refurbishing the Bataan nuclear plant to building new small modular reactors (SMRs). Then that would assure our economic security.

Network industries, including electricity, natural gas, rail transportation and telecommunications, consist of potentially competitive activities, such as electricity generation, with naturally monopolistic ones, such as transmission and distribution of electricity. This combination produces a unique set of challenges to competition law and policy in designing a market structure and regulatory framework which maximise the benefits of liberalisation while effectively controlling any tendencies to monopolistic abuse. Mumbai, India where parallel licencing in electricity retail was introduced unintentionally illustrates this challenge.

The Electricity Act 2003 (EA 2003) provides for opening up electricity distribution to the private sector. Section 14 of EA 2003 which allows parallel licencing states that ""the appropriate commission may grant a licence to two or more persons for distribution of electricity through their own distribution system within the same area, subject to the conditions that the applicant for grant of licence. The grant of the licence within the same area, subject to the conditions that the applicant for grant of licence within the same area shall, without prejudice to the other conditions or requirements under this Act, comply with the additional requirements (including the capital adequacy, credit-worthiness, or code of conduct) as may be prescribed by the Central Government, and no such applicant who complies with all the requirements for grant of licence, shall be refused grant of licence on the ground that there already exists a licensee in the same area for the same purpose"".

Parallel licensing in Mumbai was initiated not through policy or a careful reading of Section 14 of EA 2003, but through litigation over power purchase agreements (PPAs) between existing players when EA 2003 was enacted. Analysis of the outcome may be seen both as a muddle or a model for delicencing electricity retail across India in the future.

The ""muddle"" lens of the electricity delicencing experiment in Mumbai exposes sub-optimal outcomes for customers and complex challenges for regulators, who need to balance the interests of the licensees and those of the consumers, and also for the judiciary that has to interpret Section 14 and related provisions of EA 2003. Despite multiple regulatory and judicial interventions since 2008, expected outcome of competitive tariff for consumers has not materialised. In addition, issues of cherry picking of consumers by one distribution licensee (DL) in the area served by the other, disputes over duplication of distribution networks, cherry picking of consumers, use of networks owned by one licensee by the other, and over cross subsidies over use of the distribution network, power purchase agreements (PPAs) continue to persist along with other challenges.

Since the introduction of parallel licencing in 2008, Tata Power Corporation -- Distribution (TPCD) and Reliance Infrastructure Distribution (erstwhile Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited or BSES, later acquired by Reliance Infrastructure limited [Rinfra] which was taken over by Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited [AEML] in 2017), the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport [BEST] and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited [MSEDCL] have indulged in legal conflict over the interpretation of provisions in section 14 of EA 2003.

In 2008, the Supreme Court held that TPCD, that was a bulk supplier of electricity in Mumbai and was entitled to supply electricity in retail, directly to all consumers within its area of supply, as stipulated in its licences following provisions of EA 2003. Subsequently, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) confirmed TPCD as a DL for the entire city of Mumbai, covering the licence areas of both BEST and Rinfra. TPCD's distribution licence was valid up to August 2014. In 2014, TPCD secured a licence to distribute electricity in the entire Mumbai district, part of the Mumbai suburban district and the entire municipal corporation area(legally contested). The distribution licence (DL) was granted for a period of 25 years effective from August 2014 till August 2039. The DL covered an area overlapping the entire licensed area of Rinfra, BEST and MSEDCL.

Historically, TPCD was a power generator and bulk supplier of power in Mumbai. One of the bulk power purchasers with whom TPCD had signed PPAs was Rinfra. This relationship created unique challenges when TPCD entered distribution. As TPCD had access to low-cost power, it was able to offer lower tariffs to consumers in areas where it was a parallel licensee. This facilitated bulk consumers and eventually also domestic consumers to switch suppliers from Rinfra to TPCD. This was an intended outcome. However, TPCD had no incentive to supply power to Rinfra at competitive rates. This imposed additional costs on Rinfra in securing PPAs with alternative suppliers. For its part, Rinfra could impose wheeling charges on TPCD for transporting electricity on behalf of TPCD on its distribution network. These issues were part of the legal conflict between the players in the arena. The prospect of TPCD building its own distribution network, thus duplicating the existing network controlled by Rinfra was another contested issue. The result was a patchwork of temporary solutions imposed by the regulatory and other institutions such as cost plus mechanism for tariff determination. The cost-plus mechanism allowed parallel distributers in Mumbai to source expensive power purchased through short-term power markets and pass on the costs to the consumer. Customer interest was compromised as the cost of power procured through short-term markets was typically higher than that of power purchased through long-term PPAs. Customers also had to bear the risk of uncertainty in tariffs when a large share of the power supplied was procured through short-term markets. Structural barriers such as limitation in transmission capacity limited low-cost power procurement from outside the Mumbai area through competitive bidding. This meant a higher average tariff for consumers. When regulated tariff did not permit full cost recovery, DLs transformed unrecovered costs into regulatory assets, essentially costs recoverable from customers in the future through regulated tariffs. This was not an intended outcome of competition in retail electricity. Seen through the ""muddle"" lens, parallel licensing in Mumbai highlights inequitable outcomes for consumers reflected in high and uncertain tariffs and sub-optimal consequences of regulatory inadequacy reflected in incessant litigation. This is not an outcome that one would expect in Mumbai which exhibits high household density (number of consumers per unit area), a distribution network that is mostly underground that reduces losses, few agricultural consumers and higher household incomes compared to most of the rest of India all of which contribute to lower distribution losses and greater tolerance for higher electricity tariff. And yet parallel licencing has not been a great success.

The ""model"" lens highlights the introduction of private players in electricity distribution and the consequent improvement in the financial and technical efficiency of their operations. Even small improvements in the economic and technical efficiency of operations of private licensees' stands in contrast to the persistent underperformance of state-run distribution companies (discoms) that are forced to carry social burdens (sustaining employment and subsidies). The annual integrated rating and ranking of power sector utilities by power finance corporation (PFC) rates distribution companies on parameters based on (i) financial sustainability (average cost of supply[ACS]-annual revenue realised [ARR], days receivable, days payable to gencos and transcos, adjusted quick ratio, debt service coverage ratio, leverage [debt/earnings before interest, tax and amortization]) (ii) performance (distribution loss, billing efficiency, collection efficiency, corporate governance and (iii) external environment (subsidy realised, loss taken over by state government, government dues, tariff cycle timelines and auto pass-through of fuel costs). In the 12 annual rating and ranking of distribution companies for 2023, six out of the top ten ranks go to private companies and the top rank and rating goes to one of the parallel licensees in Mumbai, Adani Energy Mumbai Limited (AEML). AEML serves 7 divisions of Mumbai city and serves over 3 million retail customers. It has no agricultural consumers and over 14 percent of its customers are from the commercial & industrial segments. AEML had a billing efficiency of 93.7 percent and collection efficiency of 99.8 percent. Its days receivable was 17 and days payable was 38. The aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) in the areas served by AEML fell from 11 percent to about 6 percent over 5 years. AEML also claims that it has increased the share of renewables from 3 percent to over 30 percent with 50,000 green tariff customers. In 2023, applications of Adani Electricity Navi Mumbai (AENML) and Torrent Power Ltd (TPL) were pending before MERC for parallel licences in the jurisdiction of the MSEDCL illustrating the attractiveness of the business for private players.

Since the implementation of parallel licencing in Mumbai, structural issues that contributed to the ""muddle"" have improved substantially. There are a number of options for retail distributers to source power as constraints in transmission have been resolved. This has eliminated the need for cost-plus regulation of tariff. Overall tariff and uncertainty over tariff have reduced for domestic retail consumers. Consumer experience with billing and exercise of choice has also improved substantially with introduction of new technology. Separation of carriage (wires) and content (electricity) is yet to materialise physically but it is functioning in practice with the use of distribution network common to all the DLs who pay wheeling charges. The two private parallel licensees TPCD and AEML have no regulatory assets as of 2022, and their financial sustainability is among the best in the country. However, this does not mean that the parallel licencing muddle is now a model for the rest of the country. Unique features of Mumbai city that include high density with no agricultural consumers, greater incomes that can accommodate higher tariff and a long history of private sector presence in generation and distribution that are critical to accommodating parallel licencing cannot be replicated across the country. In many states agricultural or subsidised consumption of electricity is dominant and incumbent distribution companies are saddled with high levels of debt. The Mumbai model demonstrates the tendency of DLs to ""vertically integrate"" with their own sister concerns that generate power. This has the potential to limit the benefits of competition in retail particularly in the context of reducing tariff. The fact that there is no fully evolved wholesale market for power procurement along with the fact that there is no market for fuels (coal, natural gas, hydro, nuclear, renewables) has limited reduction in tariff, one of the key benefits of competition.

Regulation is necessary, because in most cities or States in India, no more than two or three DLs are likely to compete. This would be oligopolistic competition with limited benefits. The complexities in sourcing power in the early stages of introducing parallel licencing in Mumbai clearly highlights that wholesale competition must be in place before retail competition is introduced across the nation. In the case of Mumbai, retail competitor Rinfra was dependent upon its retail rival TPCD for its electricity supply. This created a price squeeze situation. Judiciary and regulatory interventions were inadequate in addressing price squeeze. Competition continues to be limited to a struggle for customers between privately owned and publicly-owned DLs in Mumbai. The arena for competition should be expanded, as the wireless telecommunications industry illustrates, to offer benefits to consumers not obtainable from regulation alone. Studies have shown that the only successful regulation of electric utilities has been to introduce competition and competitive interaction that eliminates the need for regulation. In mature electricity markets, distribution utilities exposed to true competition have lowered prices and gained sales. More crucially, their finances have met the regulatory test of attracting capital for expansion. In a number of cases, rates of return have risen and exceeded those of comparable companies not under competition. The key lesson from the Mumbai muddle is for legislators, regulators, and courts to recognize that regulation is not a substitute for competition, but rather is an adjunct to competition.

According to Union Ministry of Power, peak power demand in India is likely to cross 400 GW (gigawatt) by 2030 and more generation capacity is being set up to meet the rising demand. Electricity is the most important infrastructure which is a sine qua non for development, it said. One major distinguishing feature between a developing and a developed country is that in a developed country, there is no load shedding. It said that the nation will add enough capacity to meet this burgeoning demand.

The national capital's peak power demand recorded an all-time high winter power demand, reaching 5,816 megawatt (MW) - the highest ever for the winter months, surpassing the previous record of 5,798 MW set on 19 January. Remarkably, this is the sixth instance in January when Delhi's power demand exceeded last year's peak winter demand of 5,526 MW, recorded on 6 January 2023. Barring 2 January, the city's peak demand has consistently surpassed 5,000 MW every day this month so far. The surge in power demand comes on the back of a cold wave across northern India. In the areas served by BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL), peak demand reached 2,526 MW and 1,209 MW, respectively. As per the Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, it met its highest winter peak power demand of 1,826 MW.

The 4,000 MW power project -- Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (PVUNL) -- a joint venture of the NTPC Ltd and the Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) formed after scrapping the old Patratu Thermal Power Station (PTPS) will bring a revolutionary change in the power sector of Jharkhand, making it self-sufficient in terms of power requirement. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the NTPC and the JBVNL, 85 percent of the power produced from PVUNL will be supplied to Jharkhand. The mega power plant conceived in 2016 will comprise five units of 800 MW each and will be commissioned in two phases -- 2,400 MWs (3x800 MW) in the first phase and 1,600 MWs (2x800) in the second phase.

Discom Reform

A roadmap to eliminating power cuts, which has eluded the Noida city (Uttar Pradesh) for decades even as it has grown manifold - both in terms of economy and population - is finally taking shape. The Noida Authority has allocated INR2 billion (bn) (US$24.1 million (mn)) for a pilot project to move power transmission lines under the ground in three sectors -- 3, 15A and 47. Apart from these sectors, the Authority will shift 11 kV (kilovolt) and 33 kV lines underground in some other areas of the city where roads are undergoing a revamp. Occurring almost daily, power cuts have stood out as a sore point in Noida's concerted push to promote the NCR city as a business destination.

Polaris Smart Metering has secured two smart meter projects totalling INR52 bn (US$627.4 mn) in Uttar Pradesh. Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL) has awarded the contracts for installing over 5.1 million smart meters in the important clusters of Lucknow and Ayodhya/Devipatan, which the company plans to install over the next 27 months. As per the agreement, Polaris Smart Metering will supply, commission, install and maintain smart meters for consumers and system metering across the consumer base in these clusters for the next 10 years.

Electric equipment maker HPL Electric and Power has bagged an order worth INR2.4 bn (29 mn) for smart meters from Advanced Metering Infrastructure Service Provider (AMISP). This accomplishment adds to HPL's already existing significant order pipeline, reinforcing its ongoing upward momentum in the dynamic smart meter sector, the company said.

Generation

Prime Minister (PM) of India dedicated two power projects by NTPC and laid the foundation stone of another with a total investment of INR289.78 bn (US$3.5 bn) in Odisha on 3 February. Located in Sundergarh district, the Darlipali STPP is a pit-head power station with supercritical (highly efficient) technology and will supply low-cost power to its beneficiary states such as Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Sikkim. The 250 MW project of NTPC-SAIL Power Company Ltd was established in Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) to provide reliable power for the steel plant, which is vital for economic growth. NTPC is developing the Talcher Thermal Power Project, Stage-III, within the old TTPS plant premises in Angul district, was taken over by NTPC from Odisha State Electricity Board in 1995.

Regulation and Governance

According to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre is moving towards making the electricity bill of the households in the country zero. PM's remarks came while addressing a gathering after inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of projects worth INR115.99 bn (US$1.4 bn) in Guwahati.

The Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, a Rajasthan government-owned power discom (distribution company), vehemently opposed in the Supreme Court (SC) a plea of Adani Power seeking over INR13 bn (US$156.9 mn) as late payment surcharge (LPS) from the state discom. A bench comprising Justices Aniruddha Bose and PV Sanjay Kumar reserved its order on Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd (APRL)'s petition pertaining to its demand for late payment surcharge after hearing heated arguments by senior lawyers Abhishek Singhvi and Dushyant Dave.

According to Union Ministry of Power, the Union government is looking to set March 2025 as the deadline for 24x7 electricity supply across the country. After connecting all households with electricity supply through two flagship schemes in the past decade, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government now plans to ensure uninterrupted reliable power supply by the end of 2024-25 (FY25).

North & South America

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), United States (US) power consumption will rise to record highs in 2024 and 2025. EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,112 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2024 and 4,123 billion kWh in 2025. That compares with 3,994 billion kWh in 2023 and a record 4,070 billion kWh in 2022. As homes and businesses use more electricity instead of fossil fuels for heat and transportation, EIA forecast 2024 power sales would rise to 1,530 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,396 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,035 billion kWh for industrial customers. That compares with all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,391 billion kWh in 2022 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

According to the US EIA, wholesale electricity prices for 2024 in most areas of the US are seen to be close to or slightly lower than in 2023, because of relatively stable generation fuel costs. Periods of high demand or power market supply constraints, however, could lead to temporary spikes in wholesale prices, it said. EIA forecasts US wholesale prices to range between US$30 per megawatt hour (MWh) and US$40 per MWh outside of the Northeast, where the agency expects prices to increase and average US$48/MWh in New York and US$60/MWh in New England. The main source of electricity in the US is natural gas-fired generation, with EIA expecting natural gas prices for the production of electricity to average US$2.91 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2024 compared with US$3.29 per mmBtu in 2023. In most areas, average wholesale electricity costs should remain lower than or comparable to those of the previous year due to lower natural gas prices, the report said. US wholesale power prices are typically calculated on an hourly or daily basis and are designed to reflect market conditions at a specific time.

A winter storm bringing snow, ice and high winds to parts of the US Midwest and Pacific Northwest knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, with a brutal freeze expected to grip numerous states. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said storms continue to cause flight cancellations and delays. Some 150,000 homes and businesses were without power in Michigan. Power was out for another 200,000-plus customers in Oregon and Wisconsin.

The Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) lifted the grid alert issued earlier in the day asking customers to reduce their consumption to avoid a power shortfall after a demand spike caused by extreme cold. The AESO earlier declared the grid alert and asked citizens to immediately reduce their electricity use to essential needs in response to ongoing extreme cold temperatures across western Canada, restricted imports and very high demand. The AESO had projected a shortfall of up to 200 megawatt (MW) of electricity during the peak evening hours and warned of potential rotating outages until demand declined or generation returned to the grid. The AESO said after the alert was issued, it almost immediately saw a 100 MW drop in electricity demand which rose to 200 MW within minutes.

Europe & Russia

Norwegian natural gas exports were curtailed due to an unplanned outage at the Nyhamna processing plant following a power cut at the weekend amid high winds, operator Shell, opens new tab said. The power line which tripped and caused the outage at Nyhamna was repaired late, transmission grid operator Statnett said.

Ukraine reported a surplus of electricity production and intends to export it to neighbouring Moldova and Poland, Ukrainian energy ministry said. Ukraine had produced more energy than it consumed before the Russian invasion in 2022, but that output has dropped since the Russian attacks on power facilities and the occupation of Europe's largest Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said that Ukraine could resume substantial energy exports as early as this spring due to lower consumption. Ukraine banned exports during the last heating season amid Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system and large-scale shutdowns.

Major German power utility EnBW, opens new tab, a likely bidder in auctions for building initially gas-fired generation capacity under a new government scheme, could draw on its existing plant sites, its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andreas Schell said. The company, alongside sector peers Uniper and RWE, opens new tab, is tipped to be among those responding to the long-awaited roadmap laying out details of a possibly €40 billion (US$43.6 billion) plan to avoid power shortages caused by volatile renewable generation, once coal is abandoned. The plan entails state-support for perhaps 20-25 GW of electricity-producing capacity by 2035, which will either be new stations or old ones that are converted, and which are made ready for clean hydrogen operations in the long term. Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said a much-anticipated roadmap for how a new generation of gas-fired power plants would be put out to tender was imminent, fuelling hopes of financial support for the construction of these stations. The plan, with an estimated cost of up to €40 bn (US$43.5 bn), aims to ensure enough electricity generation until renewable energy can overcome storage issues and inadequate grid technology to fully replace fossil fuels. German stakeholders were set to agree a deal on the power plant expansion strategy, which has drawn criticism from environmental campaigners keen to phase out coal and gas as soon as possible.

Sweden's power demand could rise some 150 percent by 2045, transmission grid operator Svenska kraftnat said, driven by plans for new industrial developments and the conversion of fossil fuel-based industries to non-polluting energy sources. Overall demand could rise from 138 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to just over 340 TWh in 2045 under two of the four scenarios the TSO presented in its latest long-term market analysis. The scenarios were deemed the most likely as they closely align with government projections of 300 TWh demand in 2045. To meet the higher demand, Sweden would need to add on average 7.5 TWh of new power generation per year over the next 20 years.

12 February: India's demand for petroleum products is likely to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the financial year ending March 2024, following a 10 percent post-pandemic recovery in 2022-23, according to Fitch Ratings. Both petrol and diesel sales recorded robust 4-6 percent increases in the first nine months of 2023-24, fuelled by heightened economic activities in the agriculture and power sectors, coupled with a surge in holiday travel and auto sales. Fitch said it expects Indian refiners' gross refining margins (GRM) to moderate during 2024-25 from the strong levels expected in 2023-24, but remain above mid-cycle levels. By 2025-26, it foresees a shift closer to mid-cycle levels, but remaining resilient, bolstered by the escalating demand for end-products. In the upstream segment, domestic oil and gas production has modestly increased, driven by a 5 percent rise in gas production in the first nine months of 2023-24. Fitch forecasts the oil and gas sector's high capex intensity to continue in the medium term, particularly with upstream companies investing in production enhancement.

8 February: India wants to sign a multi-year oil purchase deal with Guyana and acquire stakes in the South American nation's exploration areas, the Guyanese minister for natural resources Vickram Bharrat said. He said any such deal with India would have to be approved by Guyana's cabinet. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, wants to diversify its crude sources. India approved the signing of a five-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Guyana earlier this month for cooperation in energy. After a meeting with India's Oil Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, Bharat said Indian companies are interested in picking up stakes in Guyana's exploration acreage through negotiation rather than a bidding process.

8 February: India's fuel consumption rose 8.2 percent year-on-year in January, government data showed, helped by strong industrial activity in the world's third largest oil consumer. Total consumption, a proxy for oil demand, totalled 20.04 million tonnes (MT) in January, up from 18.51 MT a year earlier, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed. Consumption held relatively steady month-on-month from December's seven-month high of 20.05 MT.

8 February: At the India Energy Week 2024 in Goa, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) took a significant step towards enhancing the efficiency of LPG cylinder delivery in India. The company has launched a ground-breaking initiative titled ""Pure for Sure"" that emphasizes quality and quantity assurance for LPG cylinders. The announcement was made by the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, with the aim of improving customer satisfaction. The ""Pure for Sure"" initiative is a first-of-its-kind in the industry, designed to ensure the integrity of the product from the production plant to the customer's doorstep. To do so, BPCL has introduced a tamper-proof seal with QR codes on the cylinders. When these QR codes are scanned, customers receive a pop-up and a signature tune that indicates the cylinder's gross weight at the time of filling, enabling them to verify the cylinder before acceptance. In a progressive move, BPCL plans to include women in the LPG delivery process, acknowledging their understanding of the product. This shift not only promotes gender equality but also adds a unique perspective to the delivery process. With the launch of the ""Pure for Sure"" initiative, BPCL is poised to redefine the standard in LPG cylinder delivery, focusing on reliability, transparency, and excellence in customer service.

7 February: India is expected to be the largest driver of global oil demand growth between 2023 and 2030, narrowly taking the lead from top importer China, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The world's third-largest oil importer and consumer is on track to post an oil demand increase of almost 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) between 2023 and 2030, accounting for more than one-third of the projected 3.2 million bpd of global increases in the period, the IEA said in a report. The agency forecast India's demand would reach 6.6 million bpd in 2030, up from 5.5 million bpd in 2023. The single largest basis of India's oil consumption will be diesel fuel, accounting for almost half of the rise in the nation's demand and more than one-sixth of total global oil demand growth through to 2030, the IEA said. Jet fuel is poised to grow 5.9 percent annually on average but this will be from a low base compared with other countries, it said. To meet this demand, India is expected to add 1 million bpd of new refining capacity over the seven-year period and this will increase its crude imports further to 5.8 million bpd by 2030, the IEA said.

7 February: Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd (ISPRL) has signed a deal with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) to lease 300,000 metric tonnes of storage space for three years in a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in Vizag in southern India. ISPRL operates three SPRs in southern India with combined capacity of about 5 million tonnes (MT). ISPRL said the contract with HPCL is for two years with a provision to extend it by one year. The 1.03 MT SPR at Vizag is half filled with Iraqi oil. And after leasing of space to HPCL, there is scope to rent out the remainder 200,000 tonnes space. ISPRL will soon invite bids to lease out half of the 1.5 MT SPR in Mangalore, where one of the two equally sized compartments has been leased to UAE's ADNOC. ISPRL has been selling from the caverns to local refiners after a change in the government rules in 2021.

13 February: Clean fuel supply in Kolkata is set to receive a significant boost in the coming months with the completion of the main trunk GAIL gas transportation pipeline. Bengal Gas Company Ltd CEO (chief executive officer) Anupam Mukhopadhyay stated that the GAIL gas pipeline would be completed within the next three months, with the resolution of an 800-meter hurdle and the necessary statutory clearances.

8 February: India's Petronet LNG plans to begin supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to neighbouring Sri Lanka for five years starting in 2025, its chief executive officer (CEO) Akshay Kumar Singh said. Petronet will ship 850 metric tonnes of gas daily to the island nation in 50 containers of 17 tonnes each, he said. The project will supply two gas-fired power plants in Sri Lanka, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages. Petronet plans to commission a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) in Sri Lanka and hopes to gain government approval by 2025 to build the facility by 2028. He said that Petronet, India's top gas importer, is looking for more long-term gas deals. The company signed a deal for QatarEnergy to supply it with 7.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from 2028 to 2048, extending an existing agreement.

13 February: India's coal import registered a rise of 27.2 percent to 23.35 million tonnes (MT) in December, over the corresponding month of the previous fiscal. The coal ministry is aiming for zero thermal coal import by FY26. The country's coal import was 18.35 MT in the corresponding month of the previous fiscal, according to data compiled by mjunction services ltd. Of the total imports in December, non-coking coal imports stood at 15.47 MT, against 10.61 MT imported in December 2022. Coking coal import volume was 4.84 MT, against 4.71 MT imported in the same month of the previous financial year. The coal import in the April-December period of the current fiscal increased to 192.43 MT, over 191.82 MT in the year-ago period. During the April-December period of the current fiscal, non-coking coal import was at 124.37 MT, marginally lower than 126.89 MT imported during the same period in the previous financial year. Coking coal import was at 42.81 MT during April-December 2023-24, slightly up against 41.35 MT recorded for April-December 2022-23.

7 February: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister (CM) Vishnu Deo Sai announced in the Assembly scrapping of an order issued during the previous Congress government regarding the issuance of permits for coal transportation in the state through offline mode. The move will restore the old system of coal transportation by seeking transport permits online.

11 February: No subsidised power will be provided to any minister, officer or government employee in Assam, Chief Minister (CM) Himanta Biswa Sarma said. He has instructed the power department to install prepaid meters in government quarters, including residences in the ministerial colony. Sarma that he was informed by power department officials during a recent interaction that a very nominal amount on account of the monthly power bill is deducted from the salaries of ministers and senior officers.

7 February: The Jharkhand government decided to increase the limit of free electricity to 125 units from the existing 100 units per month for domestic consumers. In a review meeting with senior officials including the chief secretary, Chief Minister (CM) Champai Soren directed the energy department to prepare a proposal in this regard. The state government started the '100-unit free electricity' scheme in 2022 with an aim to reduce financial burden of the people. The scheme is applicable up to the consumption of 100 units of electricity per month for domestic connections.

11 February: Chhattisgarh has inaugurated the country's biggest solar energy plant with a battery energy storage system located near the Dhaba village in the Rajnandgaon district. This solar facility established by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Chhattisgarh Power Distribution Company provides a capacity of 100 megawatt (MW). This solar plant ensures that there will be electricity even during the night generating over five lakh units per day. This will reduce 4.5 lakh metric tons of carbon emission and boost green energy. The on-grid solar power plant set-up by the Chhattisgarh Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA) is a significant step towards sustainable energy. The plant was established on 1 February 2024. The plant features a 100 MW solar plant equipped with 2,39,000 bifacial solar panels which is producing electricity from both the sides. The plant is expected to generate power for the next seven years using solar energy. The decision to establish the first solar park in the Bairam hill area of the Rajnandgaon district was taken by the Chhattisgarh government to maximize the use of these hilly terrains for solar power.

8 February: To propel the adoption of solar energy, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has unveiled plans to transform 17 major cities of the state into solar cities including revered cities of Ayodhya and Varanasi. Under the initiative, the development of solar cities will take place first and then the government will work towards building solar villages on the same pattern. Notably, the administration has already started its efforts to establish Ayodhya as the inaugural solar city. Recently, state's Energy Minister A K Sharma underscored UP's commitment to solar energy advancement and revealed that the state is poised to emerge as a leader in the solar energy domain, with initiatives already gaining momentum. Ayodhya's solar city project encompasses the installation of over 2,500 solar-powered streetlights, enhancing the sacred city's commitment to sustainability. CM (Chief Minister) Yogi Adityanath started a solar boat service in Ayodhya. The city already boasts solar-powered amenities such as ATMs and solar trees adorning its 40 intersections, epitomising the city's embrace of renewable energy solutions. With Ayodhya spearheading the solar energy adoption, another major city Varanasi is making a foothold to install rooftop solar plants across government buildings. Under the project, Varanasi is slated to witness the installation of 25,000 rooftop solar plants, positioning it as a beacon of solar innovation.

7 February: SJVN Ltd said it has received a letter of intent (LoI) from Gujarat Urja Vias Nigam Ltd to set up a 200 megawatt (MW) solar power project. The tentative cost of construction and development of this project is INR11 billion, SJVN chairman and managing director (CMD) Geeta Kapur said. The ground-mounted solar project shall be developed by SJVN subsidiary SJVN Green Energy Ltd (SGEL) anywhere in India through an EPC contract. The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) shall be executed with GUVNL after the adoption of the tariff by GERC (Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission), it said. The project is expected to generate 508.4 million units in the first year after commissioning and the projected cumulative energy generation over a period of 25 years is 11,836.28 million units.

13 February: OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) stuck to its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2024 and 2025 and raised its economic growth forecasts for both years saying there was further upside potential. The OPEC said world oil demand will rise by 2.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 and by 1.85 million bpd in 2025. A further boost to economic growth could give additional tailwind to oil demand. OPEC's 2024 demand growth forecast is already higher than that of other forecasters such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), although the wider OPEC+ alliance is still cutting output to support the market. For this year, OPEC's expectation of oil demand growth is much more than the expansion of 1.24 million bpd so far forecast by the IEA. The IEA, which represents industrialised countries, is scheduled to update its forecasts. OPEC and the IEA have clashed in recent years over issues such as long-term demand and the need for investment in new supply. The IEA sees oil demand peaking by 2030 as the world shifts to cleaner energy, a view OPEC dismisses.

12 February: United States (US) oil output from top shale-producing regions will rise in March to its highest in four months, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Production from the top basins will rise by nearly 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.7 million bpd, its highest since December, the EIA said. Oil output in the Permian basin, the largest US shale field spread across West Texas and New Mexico, was due to rise by about 14,000 bpd to 6.1 million bpd, the second highest monthly output on record after November, the EIA said. Production in the Eagle Ford in southeast Texas was due to rise nearly 4,700 bpd to 1.1 million bpd, the highest since September, the EIA said. In the Bakken, output was set to rise by about 3,000 bpd to 1.2 million bpd, the highest since December.

12 February: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Middle East economies were lagging below growth projections due to oil production cuts and the Israel-Gaza conflict, even as the global economic outlook remained resilient. In a regional economic report last month, the IMF revised its GDP growth forecast for the Middle East and North Africa down to 2.9 percent this year, lagging below October projections, due in part to short term oil production cuts and the conflict in Gaza.

8 February: French energy giant TotalEnergies is seeking to sell its minority share in a major Nigerian onshore oil joint venture, following Shell's divestment, CEO (chief executive officer) Patrick Pouyanne said. The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), in which TotalEnergies holds a 10 percent stake, has struggled with hundreds of onshore oil spills as a result of theft, sabotage and operational issues that led to costly repairs and high-profile lawsuits over the years. TotalEnergies is the latest international oil company seeking to withdraw from Nigeria's onshore sector after decades of operations. But the French group, which produced a total of 219,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023 in Nigeria, remains a major operator of offshore fields in the West African country. It announced the start-up of the Akpo West oilfield located 135 kilometres off the coast.

12 February: Faced with stubbornly high Russian gas imports as the war in Ukraine rages on, Austria is seeking to take more radical steps, including ending energy company OMV's long-term contract to buy gas from Gazprom, Austria's Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler said. Having long sought to maintain close ties with nearby Russia, Austria sought to end its decades-long dependency on affordable Russian gas soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, scrambling to find alternative providers. Gewessler said the Russian share of Austria's gas imports actually increased in December to a new record of 98 percent from 76 percent the month before, even if the total volume of imports fell slightly.

9 February: The Russian government has extended a permit for its Yamal LNG plant to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to German nationalised gas importer and trader SEFE until 31 December 2040. Russia banned trade with a number of companies including Gazprom Germania in 2022, but a year later the government made a special dispensation for the company to allow the LNG sales until the end of 2024. The decision to extend the permission was published as Russia's largest liquefied natural gas producer Novatek is facing sanctions and delays at its new Arctic LNG 2 project.

8 February: Germany will receive its first supplies of pipeline natural gas from Algeria under a medium-term contract signed between a subsidiary of trader VNG AG and oil and gas firm Sonatrach, the companies said. This makes VNG the first German company to purchase pipeline gas from Algeria. Germany has been forced to seek new suppliers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 ended Germany's decades of reliance on Russian gas. Algeria's gas production at 106 billion cubic meters per year, according to Sonatrach.

7 February: British energy supplier Centrica has agreed to purchase 1 million metric tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Spain's Repsol between 2025 and 2027, Centrica said. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent in the South of England.

13 February: Asia's imports of seaborne thermal coal eased from record highs in January as top buyers China and India saw arrivals ease. However, there was strength in Japan and South Korea, which helped drive some divergence in prices between the high-energy coal preferred by the third- and fourth-biggest importers in Asia, and the lower quality fuel sought by China and India. Asia seaborne imports of thermal coal, used mainly to generate electricity, dropped to 77.65 million metric tonnes in January, according to commodity analysts Kpler data. China's January imports of seaborne thermal coal slipped to 27.92 million tons from December's all-time peak of 31.59 million, but were still 34 percent above the 20.86 million from January 2023. China's appetite for imported coal has been fuelled by strong demand for thermal generation amid lower output from hydropower, as well as by a price advantage compared to domestic coal prices. The main grades imported by China are lower-energy coal from Indonesia and mid-rank fuel from Australia.

13 February: United States (US) energy regulators have launched a review of the performance of the bulk power system during recent winter storms in January that brought Arctic air across much of North America, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said. Elliott was the name given to the system that brought frigid cold and blowing winds, knocking out power for more than 1.5 million homes and businesses across the US in December 2022. In November 2023, the US energy regulators urged lawmakers to fill a regulatory blind spot to maintain reliable supply of natural gas during extreme cold weather that was highlighted by an inquiry into power outages during Elliott.

8 February: German gas-fired electricity generation jumped to its highest levels in two years in January as power firms dialled up output to compensate for the closure of the country's nuclear reactors and meet higher heating demand during a cold snap last month. The 8.74 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity generated from gas-fired power stations was the highest since January 2022, according to think tank Ember, which was just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to the severing of gas pipeline flows to Europe's largest gas consumer and economy. Gas-powered generation was 13 percent above January 2023 levels, and helped lift Germany's total electricity generation to its highest level in a year. Higher gas generation also lifted natural gas' share of Germany's electricity generation mix to 18.6 percent, the highest since early 2021, which indicates that German power firms remain reliant on fossil fuels for electricity production despite ongoing energy transition efforts. While German power producers lifted generation from gas power plants in January, use of coal-fired generation remains below previous levels. Coal-fired electricity production in January was 10.83 TWh, which was down 29 percent from January 2023 and around 22 percent below the average coal generation levels of 2022.

8 February: China's National Development and Reform Council (NDRC) is moving to refine the pricing mechanisms for services essential to stabilising power supply in markets increasingly dependent on wind and solar power, in a fresh step toward creating a national electricity market by 2030. NDRC said it would focus on optimising pricing mechanisms for standby capacity, frequency modulation and so called peak shaving - which are ancillary services essential to maintaining reliable electricity supply. The peak shaving market allows power companies to buy power from quick-ramping sources such as energy storage and flexible coal plants, to help them meet spikes in demand. Frequency regulation helps maintain normal frequency on the grid, a function that can be performed by battery storage systems and generators such as coal- and gas-fired plants. The ancillary services rule is among a series of basic documents setting out the rules for a national electricity market by 2025, with the market's start targeted for 2030.

9 February: European Union (EU) countries voted to pass a law to reduce emissions from trucks, after late demands by Germany had threatened to sink the policy. The move is the latest in a string of last-minute upsets to European Union (EU) laws, caused by disputes within Germany's three-way coalition government. The law, which will enforce a 90 percent cut in CO (carbon dioxide) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles by 2040, still needs approval from the EU Parliament to enter into force. To win Germany's backing, EU countries agreed to add a preamble to the law which said the European Commission would consider developing rules to register trucks running on COneutral fuels, which could count towards the targets, diplomats said.

8 February: Britain's biggest bank HSBC has partnered with Google to finance fast-growing climate technology firms behind some of the world's most promising solutions to global climate change. Under terms of the partnership, HSBC will look to provide financing to companies cherry-picked by the US technology giant to join its Google Cloud Ready-Sustainability programme. Scaling technologies that can help the corporate world move more quickly to a low-carbon economy dominated the COP28 climate talks in Dubai in December, and is a crucial part of most banks' efforts to drive a global push to cut emissions.

8 February: Australia experienced its eighth-warmest year in 2023, with the influence of climate change pushing average temperatures almost 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1961-1990 average, the weather bureau said. Last year's extreme weather swings took Australia from widespread flooding and the coolest January since 2002 through the hottest southern hemisphere winter and early spring and driest three months on record to end with heavy rainfall as summer got underway. Forecasters warn that climate change will make Australia hotter and increase the severity of weather extremes. The bureau said that globally 2023 was the warmest year on record, with ocean temperatures at their highest ever since April and the extent of Antarctic sea ice at a record low for much of the year. For most of 2023, Australia was in the grip of an El Nino weather phenomenon - a warming of the Pacific Ocean waters along the equator off the coast of South America that typically causes hot, dry weather in Australia and Southeast Asia.

Brunnthal/Munich, Germany- SFC Energy AG (""SFC"", F3C:DE, ISIN: DE0007568578), a leading supplier of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions, published its figures for the first quarter of 2024 today.

Management Board Report

Dr Peter Podesser, CEO of SFC Energy AG: ""Last year's favourable business performance continued seamlessly in the first quarter of 2024, delivering top figures in terms of sales and profitability once again. The focus on improving our earnings sustainably in tandem with international expansion is increasingly showing up in our key figures and sets us clearly apart in our sector.

Our international expansion continues to progress in line with our growth strategy. Our production facility in India, which went into operation in the third quarter of 2023, completed its first major deliveries to customers in the public safety sector in the first quarter. Our sales team in the United States is likewise being scaled up as planned. We are also on schedule with the expansion of our new site in Cluj, Romania, and the establishment of membrane production in the UK, which is an important building block in SFC Energy's long-term competitiveness and the achievement of greater vertical integration.

In the first quarter, a follow-up order worth a record EUR 27.8 million was awarded. This success is the result of the unwavering commitment of the entire team at SFC Energy, which is increasingly reflected in the sustainable expansion of the international footprint of our business as well as in long-term partnerships. One example of a successful partnership - both at the customer and the product level - is the series launch of the HGenset mobile hydrogen (electricity) generator following a successful field test at music festivals, by construction companies and telecommunications providers. Together with our partners TEST-Fuchs GmbH from Austria and the Auto AG Group from Switzerland, we have already sold preliminary units after a period of just under 24 months from the initial idea to series production, including CE certification. Similarly, our newly developed EFOY ProShelter hybrid system is now proving its capabilities under extreme weather conditions in Northern Quebec, Canada, supplying electrical power to critical telecommunications infrastructure.

At the Hanover Fair, we not only welcomed new customers and signed contracts, but also presented our EFOY HPowerPack X50 pilot series (""EFOY Hydrogen Power Pack X50""). With a continuous electrical power output of 50 kW, the EFOY HPowerPack X50 sets new standards and addresses a wider range of power requirements. Reliable, low-maintenance and emission-free output of up to 200 kW can be achieved by clustering four units. Our mobile and stationary power supply solutions based on our hydrogen and methanol fuel cells now offer a ""continuous"" power range from 20 W to 200 kW for a variety of customer applications.

The extremely satisfying first quarter of 2024 was driven by the Clean Energy segment and the regions of Europe and Asia. In addition, a higher operating leverage effect, thanks to disproportionately low costs relative to sales, and a favourable product mix resulted in further significant improvements in margins.

Development of orders and sales

Order intake in the reporting period came to EUR 51,608 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 34,809 thousand). Accordingly, the Group's order backlog widened to EUR 92,848 thousand as of March 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: EUR 81,300 thousand).

In the period from January 1 to March 31, 2024, the SFC Energy Group generated significant growth of 45.9% in sales, which climbed to EUR 40,048 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 27,454 thousand). This favourable performance is once again the result of strong organic growth in the Clean Energy segment. In regional terms, Asian business generated very positive impetus from India, delivering some of the strongest sales growth and significantly widening its share of Group sales to 27.4%, up from 3.5% in the previous year.

Development of the segments

Sales in the Clean Energy segment increased significantly by 73.4% to EUR 30,804 thousand in the first quarter of 2024, up from EUR 17,764 thousand in the same quarter of the previous year. The segment's sales growth was driven on the one hand by fuel cell solutions for industrial applications - which made the greatest contribution to segment sales - and on the other hand by higher sales to customers in the public safety sector. Sales to industrial customers in the segment climbed by around 30% compared to the previous year. By contrast, sales to customers for private applications decreased. Clean Energy, whose share of Group sales widened significantly in the first quarter to 76.9% (Q1/2023: 64.7%), remained the segment with the highest sales. By contrast, the Clean Power Management segment's share of Group sales contracted to 23.1% (Q1/2023: 35.3%). Sales in this segment fell slightly by 4.6% to EUR 9,224 thousand in the quarter under review, compared to EUR 9,690 thousand in the previous year. While business in Power Management solutions expanded noticeably, frequency converter business for the upstream oil and gas industry experienced a decline over the same quarter of the previous year.

Development of earnings

The sharp organic sales growth and the significant increase in the gross profit margin in both segments led to a substantial 75.2% increase in gross profit to EUR 17,893 thousand in the first quarter of 2024 (Q1/2023: EUR 10,214 thousand). The resulting gross margin for the Group came to 44.7% in the quarter under review (Q1/2023: 37.2%), significantly higher than in the same quarter of the previous year.

Gross profit for the individual segments compared to the previous year is as follows:

EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring effects climbed significantly in the first quarter of 2024 to EUR 8,997 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 3,347 thousand), mainly due to the higher gross profit and the disproportionally small increase in functional costs relative to sales. The adjusted EBITDA margin also widened at an extraordinary rate compared to the previous year to 22.5% (Q1/2023: 12.2%).

EBIT adjusted for non-recurring effects rose to EUR 7,548 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 2,151 thousand), resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 18.8%, which was more than double that of the previous year (Q1/2023: 7.8%). The first quarter closed with a consolidated net result for the period of EUR 5,248 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 2,035 thousand), which corresponds to an increase of 157.8%. Undiluted and diluted earnings per share in accordance with IFRS improved in the quarter under review to EUR 0.30 and EUR 0.29 respectively (Q1/2023: EUR 0.12 and EUR 0.11 respectively).

Balance sheet

At 72.5% as of March 31, 2024, the equity ratio was broadly unchanged over the end of 2023 (72.6%). The net financial position (freely available cash and cash equivalents less liabilities to banks) increased to EUR 63,234 thousand as of March 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: EUR 56,056 thousand). As of March 31, 2024, the SFC Energy Group had 413 permanent employees (December 31, 2023: 403).

Forecast for 2024

Following a very successful start to the 2024 financial year, which saw exceptionally strong sales growth in the Clean Energy segment, the Management Board confirms its full-year forecast for the current financial year dated February 22, 2024 and expects Group sales of between EUR 141.7 million to EUR 153.5 million (2023: EUR 118.1 million), adjusted EBITDA in the range of EUR 17.5 million to EUR 22.4 million (2023: EUR 15.2 million) and adjusted EBIT of EUR 9.8 million to EUR 14.7 million (2023: EUR 9.7 million). In particular, this forecast takes account of expenses in connection with regional expansion and the establishment of MEA production in Swindon, UK, the expansion of the service and sales subsidiary in Orem (UT), United States, and the ramp-up of the production company in Cluj, Romania, which will have a negative impact on earnings in the Clean Energy segment.

Furthermore, the Management Board assumes that there will be capacity restrictions in the production of fuel cells in the second and possibly the third quarter, depending on the availability of MEAs.

8129057354,eng,False,2024-05-15,15:02:10,2024-05-15T15:02:10Z,2024-05-15T15:01:27Z,news,0.5568627715110779,https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/102319/,Discover more,"MOSCOW. May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,5,,eng-9563546

His father was an enterprising craftsman who was also involved in local government and culture. He wanted Ferdinand to take over the family's plumbing trade, but when he saw how technically gifted his son was and how ambitious he was, he did not prevent him from pursuing his dreams, says Lukáš Nachtmann, historian and head of the archives at Škoda Auto, which now looks after the Porsche family home:

""Young Ferdinand would come up with all sorts of technical improvements at home that surprised his parents, although not always in a positive sense. But when he succeeded in installing electricity in his family home, his father realized that this was the direction he should take.""

At the age of 18, Porsche began an apprenticeship with the United Electric Works Inc. in Vienna, and gradually worked his way up from low-level positions, attending electrical engineering classes at the university in his spare time and soon becoming head of the test operation.

In 1898, Porsche received an offer from C. K. Lohner, a court factory specializing in carriages, which needed an electric motor for their new automobile. Porsche's enthusiasm for the project led to intense collaboration, and he eventually accepted an offer to become the company's full-time employee.

Porsche introduced a novel concept car called the ""Lohner-Porsche system"", where each of the front wheels contained a 2.5 horsepower electric motor. His design for the Lohner-Porsche attracted a lot of attention. Not only did the electric car break several speed records, but it also won a gold medal at the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris, says Mr. Nachtmann:

""Other manufacturers used gears routinely. Both the internal combustion engine and the electric motor drove the wheels on the axle through gears. Ferdinand Porsche came up with the idea that the electric cars would have electric motors directly in the hubs of the wheels. So that was unique.""

Although the concept of internal combustion engine cars ultimately prevailed, it's no exaggeration to say that Porsche, with his idea of a hybrid car, was essentially ahead of his time by nearly a century.

However, Porsche's career did not really get off the ground until after the First World War in Germany, when he joined the Daimler company in Stuttgart as chief designer. He was behind the concept of several highly successful racing and luxury cars.

In the early 1930s, he founded his own design firm, which designed and sold technical solutions to other companies. It was here that the concept German's people's car, or Volkswagen was born. It was supposed to be a practical vehicle for four adults that would cost less than a thousand marks.

Although production failed to get underway before the start of the Second World War, the solution later gave rise to one of the most iconic cars of the 20th century: the VW Beetle. Lukáš Nachtmann explains what made it so popular:

""It was successful firstly because it has a simple design, and secondly because it was cheap. Like the VW minivan, which became famous in the United States during the Hippie era, I think that the popularity of VW Beetle was also helped by that community and by the era.""

Ferdinand Porsche's son Ferry inherited his father's technical and engineering talent and imagination, but focused on sports cars. Another iconic car of the 20th century, the Porsche 911, is the result of his work.

In the 1930s, Ferdinand Porsche joined the NSDAP, working actively with the Nazis on the development of the People's Car, but he also designed military vehicles, such as the wheeled tractor, or Radschlepper Ost, that was produced in Mladá Boleslav. Porsche eventually became a member of the SS and reached the rank of SS-Oberführer. Lukáš Nachtmann again:

""You know the saying: who wants to live with wolves must howl with them. If he wanted to create in the time he lived in, he had to cooperate with the regime. The regime gave him an opportunity and he took advantage of it.

""He was simply a technician who wanted to work, to promote his ideas and visions, to put his ideas into practice. He got involved with the regime that ruled Germany at the time and as a result, damaged his reputation.""

After the war, Ferdinand Porsche was invited to France to help rebuild the local car industry. However, it was just a pretext. As soon as he got to France, he was arrested by the French authorities and remanded in custody as an alleged war criminal. He was released after paying a substantial fine and later cleared by the court.

Ferdinand Porsche continued to live and work in Austria, near Zel am Zee. Visits to his home country were few and far between, says Mr. Nachtmann:

""At the end of the 1930s, a promotional ride of the future Volkswagen Beetle took place, also making a stop in Liberec. Ferdinand Porsche also visited Mladá Boleslav during the testing oh his heavy war machinery. But other than that, he didn't come back here regularly.""

Ferdinand Porsche died unexpectedly on January 30, 1951, during his first visit to Stuttgart since the end of the war. At that time, production of the Volkswagen Beetle was already well underway.

The importance of Ferdinand Porsche's legacy is underscored by the fact that they remained in production for 65 years and sold almost 22 million of them. However, his work has also influenced today's automotive industry, particularly in the development of electric and hybrid cars. And, as Lukáš Nachtmann points out, he also laid the foundation for NASA's first Moon Rover:

""Probably the most interesting, I think, is the vehicle that NASA sent to the moon, which had electric motors located in the hubs of the wheels. That Porsche's idea made it from Earth to the moon, is pretty extraordinary.""

As The Sofia Globe previously reported, Bulgaria had the largest drop in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU in the first quarter of 2023, again had the largest drop in the second quarter of 2023, and the second-largest drop in the third quarter of 2023, all on an annual basis.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have decreased in 22 EU countries, when compared with the same quarter of 2022, Eurostat said.

The largest reductions in greenhouse gases are estimated for Estonia (-23 per cent), Bulgaria (-17 per cent) and Finland (-9 per cent).

Out of the 22 EU members that are estimated to have decreased their emissions, 10 also recorded a decline in their GDP (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands and Luxembourg).

Hungary maintained the GDP at the same level while decreasing emissions.

The other 11 EU countries (Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Croatia) are estimated to have managed to decrease emissions while growing their GDP, Eurostat said.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, EU economy greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 897 million tons of CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq), a 4.0 per cent decrease compared with the same quarter of 2022 (935 million tons of CO2-eq). The EU's gross domestic product (GDP) remained stable, registering just a small increase (0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter of 2022).

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2 per cent) and manufacturing (-3.1 per cent). Emissions by households remained almost stable, Eurostat said.

Quarterly estimates of greenhouse gas emissions complement quarterly socio-economic data, such as GDP or employment. This article presents a handful of findings from the more detailed Statistics Explained article on quarterly greenhouse gas emissions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the economic sectors responsible for the largest reductions compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 were electricity and gas supply (- 17.2%) and manufacturing (-3.1%). Emissions by households remained almost stable.

Management Board Report

Dr Peter Podesser, CEO of SFC Energy AG: ""Last year's favourable business performance continued seamlessly in the first quarter of 2024, delivering top figures in terms of sales and profitability once again. The focus on improving our earnings sustainably in tandem with international expansion is increasingly showing up in our key figures and sets us clearly apart in our sector.

Our international expansion continues to progress in line with our growth strategy. Our production facility in India, which went into operation in the third quarter of 2023, completed its first major deliveries to customers in the public safety sector in the first quarter. Our sales team in the United States is likewise being scaled up as planned. We are also on schedule with the expansion of our new site in Cluj, Romania, and the establishment of membrane production in the UK, which is an important building block in SFC Energy's long-term competitiveness and the achievement of greater vertical integration.

In the first quarter, a follow-up order worth a record EUR 27.8 million was awarded. This success is the result of the unwavering commitment of the entire team at SFC Energy, which is increasingly reflected in the sustainable expansion of the international footprint of our business as well as in long-term partnerships. One example of a successful partnership - both at the customer and the product level - is the series launch of the HGenset mobile hydrogen (electricity) generator following a successful field test at music festivals, by construction companies and telecommunications providers. Together with our partners TEST-Fuchs GmbH from Austria and the Auto AG Group from Switzerland, we have already sold preliminary units after a period of just under 24 months from the initial idea to series production, including CE certification. Similarly, our newly developed EFOY ProShelter hybrid system is now proving its capabilities under extreme weather conditions in Northern Quebec, Canada, supplying electrical power to critical telecommunications infrastructure.

At the Hanover Fair, we not only welcomed new customers and signed contracts, but also presented our EFOY HPowerPack X50 pilot series (""EFOY Hydrogen Power Pack X50""). With a continuous electrical power output of 50 kW, the EFOY HPowerPack X50 sets new standards and addresses a wider range of power requirements. Reliable, low-maintenance and emission-free output of up to 200 kW can be achieved by clustering four units. Our mobile and stationary power supply solutions based on our hydrogen and methanol fuel cells now offer a ""continuous"" power range from 20 W to 200 kW for a variety of customer applications.

The extremely satisfying first quarter of 2024 was driven by the Clean Energy segment and the regions of Europe and Asia. In addition, a higher operating leverage effect, thanks to disproportionately low costs relative to sales, and a favourable product mix resulted in further significant improvements in margins.

Development of orders and sales

Order intake in the reporting period came to EUR 51,608 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 34,809 thousand). Accordingly, the Group's order backlog widened to EUR 92,848 thousand as of March 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: EUR 81,300 thousand).

In the period from January 1 to March 31, 2024, the SFC Energy Group generated significant growth of 45.9% in sales, which climbed to EUR 40,048 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 27,454 thousand). This favourable performance is once again the result of strong organic growth in the Clean Energy segment. In regional terms, Asian business generated very positive impetus from India, delivering some of the strongest sales growth and significantly widening its share of Group sales to 27.4%, up from 3.5% in the previous year.

Development of the segments

Sales in the Clean Energy segment increased significantly by 73.4% to EUR 30,804 thousand in the first quarter of 2024, up from EUR 17,764 thousand in the same quarter of the previous year. The segment's sales growth was driven on the one hand by fuel cell solutions for industrial applications - which made the greatest contribution to segment sales - and on the other hand by higher sales to customers in the public safety sector. Sales to industrial customers in the segment climbed by around 30% compared to the previous year. By contrast, sales to customers for private applications decreased. Clean Energy, whose share of Group sales widened significantly in the first quarter to 76.9% (Q1/2023: 64.7%), remained the segment with the highest sales. By contrast, the Clean Power Management segment's share of Group sales contracted to 23.1% (Q1/2023: 35.3%). Sales in this segment fell slightly by 4.6% to EUR 9,224 thousand in the quarter under review, compared to EUR 9,690 thousand in the previous year. While business in Power Management solutions expanded noticeably, frequency converter business for the upstream oil and gas industry experienced a decline over the same quarter of the previous year.

Development of earnings

The sharp organic sales growth and the significant increase in the gross profit margin in both segments led to a substantial 75.2% increase in gross profit to EUR 17,893 thousand in the first quarter of 2024 (Q1/2023: EUR 10,214 thousand). The resulting gross margin for the Group came to 44.7% in the quarter under review (Q1/2023: 37.2%), significantly higher than in the same quarter of the previous year.

Gross profit for the individual segments compared to the previous year is as follows:

EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring effects climbed significantly in the first quarter of 2024 to EUR 8,997 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 3,347 thousand), mainly due to the higher gross profit and the disproportionally small increase in functional costs relative to sales. The adjusted EBITDA margin also widened at an extraordinary rate compared to the previous year to 22.5% (Q1/2023: 12.2%).

EBIT adjusted for non-recurring effects rose to EUR 7,548 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 2,151 thousand), resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 18.8%, which was more than double that of the previous year (Q1/2023: 7.8%). The first quarter closed with a consolidated net result for the period of EUR 5,248 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 2,035 thousand), which corresponds to an increase of 157.8%. Undiluted and diluted earnings per share in accordance with IFRS improved in the quarter under review to EUR 0.30 and EUR 0.29 respectively (Q1/2023: EUR 0.12 and EUR 0.11 respectively).

Balance sheet

At 72.5% as of March 31, 2024, the equity ratio was broadly unchanged over the end of 2023 (72.6%). The net financial position (freely available cash and cash equivalents less liabilities to banks) increased to EUR 63,234 thousand as of March 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: EUR 56,056 thousand). As of March 31, 2024, the SFC Energy Group had 413 permanent employees (December 31, 2023: 403).

Forecast for 2024

Following a very successful start to the 2024 financial year, which saw exceptionally strong sales growth in the Clean Energy segment, the Management Board confirms its full-year forecast for the current financial year dated February 22, 2024 and expects Group sales of between EUR 141.7 million to EUR 153.5 million (2023: EUR 118.1 million), adjusted EBITDA in the range of EUR 17.5 million to EUR 22.4 million (2023: EUR 15.2 million) and adjusted EBIT of EUR 9.8 million to EUR 14.7 million (2023: EUR 9.7 million). In particular, this forecast takes account of expenses in connection with regional expansion and the establishment of MEA production in Swindon, UK, the expansion of the service and sales subsidiary in Orem (UT), United States, and the ramp-up of the production company in Cluj, Romania, which will have a negative impact on earnings in the Clean Energy segment.

Furthermore, the Management Board assumes that there will be capacity restrictions in the production of fuel cells in the second and possibly the third quarter, depending on the availability of MEAs.

A research group from Switzerland's ETH Zurich has investigated the role of hydrogen storage in an electricity system with large hydropower resources such as that of Switzerland.

""The study goes in the direction of understanding when hydrogen could play a role when co-existing with hydropower and pumped-hydro, or more generally within the same market,"" corresponding author professor Paolo Gabrielli told pv magazine. ""This could happen under some scenarios.""

Switzerland currently has about 6.9 TWh of hydropower dams and 2.1 TWh of pumped-hydro storage that are built or under construction. The country's electricity system - including its energy transfer with neighboring Germany, France, Italy, and Austria - was simulated using the Nexus-e platform and optimized with a linear programming (LP) optimization model.

Using software simulation and optimization, the research team focused on the Swiss electricity sector as a case study. However, they say that it should provide general design guidelines and recommendations in similar environments

The academics evaluated the need for hydrogen storage under a few techno-economic and climate scenarios with changing variables. The analysis was performed for a few target years: 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050, with their respective development and demand scenarios. PV generation was considered to be 6.76 TWh in 2030, 19.56 TWh in 2040, and 31.66 TWh in 2050.

The meteorological year was set to either dry, wet, or humid, and load-shedding costs, ranging from €1,000 ($1,080)/MWh to €10,000/MWh. In addition, three scenarios were considered for the development of Swiss neighboring countries, as defined by the Ten-Year Network Development Plans (TYNDP): national trends, global ambition, and distributed energy scenarios.

In addition, the learning rate for hydrogen technologies was set to 5%, 12%, or 20%, and the net transfer capacity (NTC) ranged from 0% to 100%. An NTC of 100% corresponds to today's values, whereas an NTC of 0% corresponds to a self-sufficient Switzerland.",pv-magazine-india.com,news,pv magazine India,Lior Kahana,0.2705882352941176,453445876,5,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2024/05/1-s2.0-S0196890424000712-ga1_lrg-280x280.jpg,

Hydraulic fracturing is a technique of stimulating oil and gas wells that is used to get fuels out of places like shale, tight sand, and coalbed methane. It entails injecting a high-pressure fluid mixture into a wellbore to induce fractures in the subterranean rock formations, allowing the oil or gas to flow more freely. The hydraulic fracturing market is being driven by rising worldwide energy demand, particularly for oil and natural gas. As conventional reserves dwindle, there is a greater reliance on unconventional resources such as shale gas and tight oil, both of which need hydraulic fracturing.

The market is being pushed by the requirement to meet the increasing energy demands of various industries. Moreover, economic factors, including oil and gas pricing, investment patterns, and market circumstances, all have an impact on the hydraulic fracturing business. The economics of hydraulic fracturing operations are affected by oil price volatility since higher oil prices often promote increased investment and activity in unconventional resource development.

List of Prominent Players in the Hydraulic Fracturing Market:

Halliburton (US), Schlumberger (US), Liberty Oilfield Services LLC (US), Baker Hughes (US), NexTier Oilfield Solutions (US), Calfrac Well Services Ltd. (Canada), STEP Energy Services (Canada), Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. (US), Trican (Canada), National Energy Services Reunited Corp. (US), Petro Welt Technologies AG (Austria), ProFrac Holding Corp. (US), Tacrom (Romania) TAM International, Inc. (US), GD Energy Products, LLC (US), ProPetro Holding Corp. (US), TechnipFMC plc (UK), Weatherford (US), Nine Energy Service (US), AFG Holdings, Inc (US).

Market Dynamics:

Drivers-

Unconventional gas deposits provide significant energy reserves to meet the expanding demand for energy and a high potential for shale and tight gas exploration and production. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) announced unconventional or limited reserves in a section of the rich Permian oil and gas basin that connects Western Texas and Southeastern New Mexico.

Several countries are in a transitional period to fully embrace unconventional gas exploration and production, which would assist in providing energy security and jobs. As a result, the increasing shift toward developing more dependable, secure, and innovative ways to acquire large amounts of oil and gas is expected to boost global market demand.

Challenges:

The fracking chemicals, including formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, are hazardous. The release of these compounds into the environment poses significant dangers. Blowouts, for example, have happened during fracking operations, and leaks of fracking fluids and other chemicals have polluted streams and lakes. As a result, fracking is accused of contaminating groundwater surrounding wells. Fracking contamination influences animal health as well. It has the potential to cause diseases, fatalities, and genetic abnormalities. Contaminants from fracking have been discovered in amounts that endanger human health.

Regional Trends:

The North America Hydraulic Fracturing Market is expected to register higher CAGR in the near future. North America has an abundance of shale resources, making it an appealing market for hydraulic fracturing. The abundance of shale formations in the United States, in particular, has contributed to increased oil and gas output. Canada also has considerable shale resources, with the Montney and Duvernay formations being prime possibilities for hydraulic fracturing. The dynamics of the North American hydraulic fracturing market have been influenced by price volatility in the oil and gas markets. Oil and gas price fluctuations impact investment decisions, drilling activity, and demand for hydraulic fracturing services.

Recent Developments:

In Apr 2023, Halliburton transferred three hydraulic fracturing fleets from natural gas basins to oil basins, the company stated. The US oilfield services behemoth revealed during its first-quarter 2023 earnings call that in a weaker natural gas market, customers had requested that the company relocate three of its fleets to oil basins. E-fleets were diesel-free hydraulic fracturing fleets that were typically powered by gas turbines and electricity. In August 2021, Alamo Pressure Pumping, LLC was bought by NexTier Oilfield Solutions. NexTier Oilfield Solutions will now have the third-biggest base of operational hydraulic horsepower in the United States and the largest base of next-generation equipment in the Permian Basin.

These efforts aim to complement and support the essential work performed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in providing urgent care. Since the beginning of hostilities, PRCS staff and volunteers have continued to courageously provide emergency medical services to communities in Gaza, amidst unacceptably high levels of loss. Seventeen PRCS colleagues have been killed while on duty, and crucial facilities have been damaged. This includes Al-Amal and Al Quds hospitals and several Emergency Medical Service (EMS) centers, as well as emergency vehicles, with 25 ambulances knocked out of service. PRCS colleagues have been detained, with concerning reports emerging of their treatment, and the whereabouts of many still unknown.

Despite these challenges, PRCS continues to do vital work to respond to the medical needs of communities in Gaza, including by running three advanced medical posts, six medical points, and three clinics, in addition to its emergency response. The PRCS are a valued partner in the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, and the ICRC and participating National Societies welcome the opportunity to support their essential work as they recover from the terrible losses in this conflict.

The 60-bed field hospital is meant to complement and support PRCS work as the medical and humanitarian community attempts to meet vast health needs in Gaza. The field hospital will provide, emergency surgical care; obstetric/gynecological, maternal, and newborn care; pediatric care; and outpatient department. Mass casualty management and triage capacities are included.

The ICRC field hospital, implemented in coordination with the PRCS and supported by Red Cross Societies of Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Norway, and Switzerland, will be able to provide medical care for roughly 200 people a day.

Attacks on medical facilities and personnel have inflicted a devastating blow on the healthcare system. According to the World Health Organization, only 33% of Gaza's 36 hospitals and 30% of primary health care centers are functional in some capacity, and those that are still operational are overwhelmed with patients, the severity of their health needs, a shortage of supplies and resources to treat them, as well as displaced people looking for safe shelter.

Medical staff are faced with people arriving with severe injuries, increasing communicable diseases which could lead to potential outbreaks, and complication related to chronic diseases untreated that should have been treated days earlier. Amputations are common, as well as acute respiratory infection, gastrointestinal illnesses and skin diseases which are spreading rapidly through displaced communities due to a lack of clean water, sanitation, and access to food. Chronic and serious illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, pneumonia, infectious and non-communicable diseases, to name a few, are not receiving the attention they deserve because the priority is to treat the critically wounded.

With health needs growing by the day in Gaza, the ICRC reiterates its call for the protection of medical facilities under international humanitarian law. No patient should be killed while lying in a hospital bed. No doctors, nurses, or any medical professionals should ever die while working to save lives. Hospitals are sanctuaries to treat and preserve human life - international humanitarian law states that all parties to the conflict must respect and protect the medical mission, including infrastructure.

The field hospital is a continuation of more than 15 years of ICRC healthcare support in Gaza. ICRC teams have been providing surgical services at the European Gaza Hospital, and supporting other hospitals through medical donations where they´ve supported thousands of patients since the escalation of the conflict.

The field hospital team will be comprised of around 30 humanitarian experts from the various contributing National Societies, resident staff, and the ICRC which will include surgeons, doctors, anesthesiologists, nurses, technicians, engineers, logisticians, and administrators.

At the moment, the National Societies are contributing the following:

The Australian Red Cross is deploying staff.The Austrian Red Cross is contributing a reverse osmosis water purification system.The Canadian Red Cross is contributing surgical equipment, medical consumables, disinfection equipment and supplies, and pharmaceuticals, as well as deploying staff.The Danish Red Cross is contributing accommodations for staff sleeping quarters and a reverse osmosis water purification system, as well as deploying staff.The Finnish Red Cross is contributing X-ray equipment, water tanks, and sinks, as well as deploying staff.The German Red Cross is contributing nursing equipment, laboratory equipment, staff accommodation materials, an electricity toolkit, water tanks, and sinks, as well as deploying staff.The Hong Kong Red Cross is deploying staff.The Icelandic Red Cross is deploying staff.The Japanese Red Cross is contributing nursing physiotherapy and an operating theater/anesthesia module.The Norwegian Red Cross, which is taking a coordinating role in the project, is contributing medical equipment, a water purification system, office equipment, tents, lighting, latrine kits, kitchen kits, and pharmaceutical drugs, as well as deploying staff.The Swiss Red Cross is deploying staff.The ICRC will maintain the medical supply throughout the functioning of the field hospital.

Video and photos of the field hospital will be available on 14 May at: www.icrcnewsroom.org

She said Masdar expects the cost of the alternative fuel to fall from its expensive levels today, as the company aims for a million tonnes of production capacity by 2030.

The target is ""definitely one that we aim to meet and to exceed"", she said.

The UAE, and several other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, are positioning themselves as future hydrogen sellers to Europe and the world market.

Potential buyers include the shipping and aviation sectors, which are near-impossible to connect to an electricity grid.

To count as green hydrogen it must be made by renewable means - for example by using wind or solar power to split it off from water in a machine called an electrolyser.

The green route provides only 0.1 per cent of the world's small hydrogen supply today, which comes mainly from gas (known as blue or grey hydrogen, which is cheaper). It is used chiefly in refining and chemicals.

However, Ms Al Hersh believes the industry is moving from an era of planning and overhyped expectations to a point of ""maturation in the market"".

Speaking to The National at a World Hydrogen summit in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, she said Masdar expects the cost of electrolysers to fall as the technology improves.

""What we anticipate on that front is an improvement in the efficiency, which will make the overall process more efficient,"" she said.

One issue with electrolysers is the fact they typically use rare metals such as platinum and iridium.

""The key to this innovation wave, which I believe is going to happen quite quickly, is to get those metals out of the system,"" said Mark Hutchinson, chief executive of metals and energy company Fortescue.

Masdar sees steelmakers as a likely ""demand centre"" for green hydrogen and is also targeting the shipping industry and makers of alternative jet fuels.

It believes companies will want to be ""early movers"" because a time will come when there is not enough hydrogen to go around, as the world battles to combat climate change.

Whether buyers choose green, blue or another kind of hydrogen will depend not only on the price but also on their desire to cut emissions, Ms Al Hersh said.

""Obviously, a greener product would be more expensive right now than its counterparts, other colours of hydrogen, but it is also one that would provide the most decarbonisation, the least carbon intensity.""

Besides electrolysers, a second factor is the availability of clean energy, which should be boosted by a pledge made at Cop28 in Dubai to treble the world's renewable firepower by 2030.

A ""big chunk"" of that clean power could go towards hydrogen production and the Cop28 deal gives the industry ""positive momentum"", Ms Al Hersh said.

Countries in the Middle East and North Africa tout the easy availability of solar power, as well as existing energy links to Europe, as they jostle to be future sellers.

European countries such as Germany, France and Austria have signalled interest in a ""southern corridor"" to buy hydrogen across the Mediterranean.

Egypt was on Tuesday making plans to work with the Netherlands on hydrogen, while Morocco urges European partners to turn to trans-Mediterranean pipelines.

The UAE and the Netherlands were leading talks on how to boost trade that heard cross-border sales in hydrogen could wipe $3.7 trillion off costs.

""The Middle East plays a massive role, and North Africa does, in the energy transition of Europe,"" said Mr Hutchinson of Fortescue, which has interests in Morocco, Oman, Egypt and Jordan.

""You've got to go to those places which are politically very stable, so Morocco fits the bill for North Africa.""

The UAE has meanwhile ""demonstrated time and time again"" that it can generate cheap solar power, said Ms Al Hersh, and now has wind in the mix after opening new turbines on the eve of Cop28.

It also benefits from free space, infrastructure, a reputation as a reliable partner and a domestic net-zero drive, as well as its place as an aviation hub, she said.

The aviation link means the UAE is seen by companies such as Britain's Rolls-Royce as a potential place to make sustainable jet fuel for cleaner air travel.

""We have our own decarbonisation targets in the UAE, we have the net-zero target, we have some industries which have very strong ambitions when it comes to decarbonisation,"" Ms Al Hersh said. ""We also have a strong aviation hub which also looks towards sustainable aviation fuel.

""But we also have a commitment towards the global community, to support their decarbonisation efforts. We can basically expand our production in order to serve the demand elsewhere as well, through exports.""",thenationalnews.com,news,The National,Tim Stickings,0.07450980392156858,453395100,1,https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/APPDBT5WRRHMBIC7TERTVF6GM4.jpg?smart=true&auth=a7ac1c18f7f4aac1423d85a8b20d975e34a43a4b26fd02b681f153bf11502cb4&width=1200&height=630,eng-9561767

Bigger events are looming only three months later: the national election that might put the far-right in charge of the Alpine country.

In less than a month Austria chooses 20 EU lawmakers to represent it in Brussels and Strasbourg.

Despite the speeches about the importance of the EU, Austrian candidates are boilerplate backbenchers - unlike neighbouring Germany, where talk-show clashes between local political firebrands and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are looming large, while in France, EU election clashes happen daily.

But Austrian party slates feature political has-beens, like centre-right Österreichische Volkspartei's (ÖVP) Reinhold Lopatka - who last held a relevant position in 2017 - or the eternal far-right Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (FPÖ) networker Harald Vilimsky - who after 10 years in parliament, looks to continue his pet project of uniting the German-speaking far-right with those in Italy and Hungary.

The centre-left Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs (SPÖ) put forward Andreas Schieder - who remains an unknown after leading the party to a massive defeat in the 2019 EU elections.

Like the candidates, the political slogans stem from a lack of motivation. Lopatka promises 'Europe. But better' while the Greens say 'Europe needs heart'.

The FPÖ appears to churn out posters at the same rate as all the other parties combined putting some zing into their campaign, with a particularly tasteless image of von der Leyen kissing Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenksyy, linking them to ""Eco-Communism"" and ""warmongering"":

The European Election is, in fact, a rehearsal for the real thing: Just three months later, sometime in September, the country's biggest parliamentary election of the decade will take place. Politicians will face the music in the form of the bill for COVID-19-related spending and the inflation that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

When citizens head to the polls to elect a new national parliament, they will unseat the longest-sitting lawmakers in the country's democratic history - after terms were extended to five years in 2007, no single government lasted this long, and it is only the second government to even make it this far.

The political cards aren't just being reshuffled - the whole table will be flipped.

2019 saw the liberal-conservative ÖVP - led by now-disgraced Sebastian Kurz - winning over a third of the vote. But today, reaching more than a fifth of the votes may be seen as a great result.

The Greens, who quadrupled their vote share to 13% in 2019, are now struggling to surpass 10%.

Meanwhile, the erstwhile biggest opposition party, the SPÖ, is floundering at about 20%, plagued by infighting and the missteps of the newly crowned far-left leader, the small-town Mayor Andreas Babler.

While initially touted as a revivalist of the well-trodden centre-left, Babler has failed to stand out politically and personally, spurning elites in favour of appealing to an undefined ""our people.""

In the other corner, the FPÖ -- with fresh support from anti-vaxxers and those partial to Russia -- is at 30%, doubling its 2019 result to become the most dominant party. This would give the far-right to claim at least the post of parliament president, with its vast procedural powers.

And Herbert Kickl, the far-right firebrand and self-styled ""People's Chancellor,"" may well become chancellor, the head of the Austrian government, a first in the country's post-war history.

When Austria first welcomed the FPÖ, then led by Jörg Haider, into government in 2000, the EU was shocked and considered sanctioning the country. Few expect that external pressures will prevail this time around.

June will show whether the FPÖ can transform polling into poll results and whether one shock election will be enough to calm the population's anger.

Until then, other political parties get to rouse their campaigners, rehearse their canvassing pitches, work on their design skills, and start training for the hot phase of the election - Kickl already did a cross-country test run last year, other politicians may well struggle to match him.

That is, at least, if you are among Lebanon's political elite, who secured €1 billion in financial aid from the European Union last week.

On May 2, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides announced the three-year assistance package at a joint press conference in Beirut with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati.

Brussels framed it as a commitment to supporting Syrian refugees and ""other vulnerable groups"" in Lebanon, as well as an effort to curb irregular migration to Europe through strengthening Beirut's border security forces.

For Lebanon's kleptocratic political class, however, the aid was a message: Europe will not hold you accountable for driving the country into the ground through your venal abuse of power, and indeed Europe will bend to manipulation if you pull the right strings.

""Upon closer inspection, it's obvious that these funds are not a policy shift, but part of a previous pattern of allocations to respond to the Syrian refugee crisis at the regional level""

Remember, this is the same political class that drove the country into crippling financial collapse five years ago and continues to stall the reforms necessary for recovery to begin, letting the country slide further into the abyss.

This is the same political class whose (at the very least) wanton recklessness led to the devastating 2020 Beirut port blast and who have actively blocked investigations to determine responsibility for this horrific national tragedy.

On top of these societal stressors, today there are also nearly 100,000 internally displaced people from the Israel-Hezbollah war on Lebanon's southern border. Social tensions are flaring as well about the country's roughly 1.5 million Syrian refugees - the largest per capita refugee population in the world.

The Syrian refugee population has, however, proved useful for the political leadership, both domestically and internationally. Senior officials from across the political spectrum have regularly scapegoated the Syrian population to deflect blame for their part in Lebanon's collapse, helping to spur security forces' widespread human rights violations against Syrian refugees.

The political class has also exploited the refugee presence to milk the international community for funding, with EU aid alone amounting to €3 billion since 2011.

In recent months, Lebanese leaders have again ramped up their hostile rhetoric against Syrians further as leverage against the EU. In December 2023, Prime Minister Najib Mikati suggested facilitating migration out of Lebanon to Europe as a way to reduce the country's refugee burden.

The killing of a Lebanese politician in early April, allegedly by a ""Syrian gang"", then sent anti-Syrian rhetoric in Lebanon to a fevered pitch. In late April 2024, caretaker Minister of Displaced Issam Charafeddine capitalised on this sentiment, saying Lebanon should ""widely open the seaports [...] in order to put pressure on the European countries.""

Racism against Syrians in Lebanon lately has been matched, perhaps, only by European policymakers' own raging xenophobia, with rising rightwing nationalism reshaping European foreign policy.

This is clear in the EU's recent deals with Mauritania, Tunisia, Egypt, and its security arrangement with Libya, all seeking to curb irregular migration to Europe.

While continuing to offer platitudes to humanist principles, all of these deals essentially pay off actors with long histories of human rights abuses to head off migrants attempting to reach European shores. Last week, it was Lebanon's turn to join the payroll.

""Whatever the outcome, the recent EU financial support arrives with minimal oversight and, as such, is likely to perpetuate Lebanon's dysfunctional governance rather than promote necessary reforms""

For years, European leaders have insisted that aid to Lebanon be contingent on reforms. In the aftermath of the 2020 Beirut port blast EU and Western leaders, most vocally, French President Emmanuel Macron, who upon landing in Beirut to much fanfare shortly after the blast, pledged that funds ""will not fall into corrupt hands.""

Funny enough, by 2022 the EU inscribed its 2021-2027 Multiannual Indicative Program (MIP), a bilateral aid program for Lebanon, which said the support ""should be conditional on satisfactory reform progress, primarily in the areas of macroeconomic and monetary policies, rule of law, anti-corruption, and the banking and electricity sectors.""

Furthermore, the MIP mandates that financial allocations for 2025-2027 must be ""preceded by a review of this MIP's implementation.""

This review did not happen, and by the EU's admission, Lebanon has fallen far short of the needed reforms. The EU, however, has failed to impose consequences and its declarations then amount to little more than posturing, mirroring the 2021 EU sanctions program targeting Lebanon. As a tool meant to penalide Lebanese leaders impeding reforms, the sanctions program has been extended three times but remains unused.

Indeed, upon closer inspection, it's obvious that these funds are not a policy shift, but part of a previous pattern of allocations to respond to the Syrian refugee crisis at the regional level.

The only 'new' elements are the rather uninspiring details of the allocation to Lebanon: around three-quarters of the funds will go to funding the UN-lead response to the refugee crisis over the next four years, something which has been going on since the war in Syria erupted in 2011.

The other quarter, which targets security sector support, is perhaps a little more novel. But such support, specifically for the Lebanese Armed Forces, has been going on for many years, supported by the EU and other Western donors.

It is in this context that von der Leyen's trip should be seen, as a political PR stunt it is: a message to her centrist base in the EU which seeks to stave off challenges from the far right in Europe by being 'tough on migration', rather than any real commitment to support Lebanon or Syrian refugees for that matter.

In fact, recent efforts by a coalition of member states, including Austria, Greece, Italy, and Cyprus, have advocated for the creation of 'safe zones' in Syria, a strategy now supported at the highest levels of the EU.

The European Council meeting on April 17, 2024, specifically addressed Lebanon and the Syrian refugee crisis, with conclusions reaffirming the need to create ""conditions for safe, voluntary, and dignified returns of Syrian refugees."" It is questionable, at best, whether any of this is rooted in reality, given the ""grave human rights abuses and persecution"" many returning Syrians have faced at the hands of their government, according to Human Rights Watch.

Whatever the outcome, the recent EU financial support arrives with minimal oversight and, as such, is likely to perpetuate Lebanon's dysfunctional governance rather than promote necessary reforms.

By not enforcing stringent aid conditions or sanctions regimes, the EU is, in effect, empowering Lebanese leaders' exploitative political strategies, which are likely to exacerbate the crises the EU aims to mitigate. In the end, the EU's funding of bad behaviour is akin to a policy of 'just carrots and no sticks,' one where Lebanon's venal leaders get the carrots, and everyone else gets the stick.

Germany's most prestigious international research award was awarded to top researchers who have chosen to join German universities from abroad. Schmalstieg is working on augmented reality projects - with the aim of making people's lives easier.

""The Humboldt Professorship is a great honor and source of motivation,"" says computer scientist Dieter Schmalstieg, who was presented with the Humboldt Professorship award by Bettina Stark-Watzinger, Federal Minister of Education and Research; and Robert Schlögl, President of the Humboldt Foundation, in Berlin on 13 May 2024. In fall 2023, he moved from Graz University of Technology to the VISUS Visualization Research Center at the University of Stuttgart. According to Schmalstieg, the department offers excellent working conditions and is a beacon in the research landscape. He was already familiar with VISUS before moving to Stuttgart, from joint projects with the institute's founder Thomas Ertl. ""That's how I knew I would fit in very well here,"" he remarks.

Schmalstieg is one of the world's leading experts in the field of visualization, the visualization of digital information. What motivates him? ""My aim is to provide people with better access to information. I want to make computer technology easier to use, more varied, more exciting, and more rewarding.

3D instead of 2D

To this end, he is developing augmented reality technologies for smart glasses. Unlike virtual reality, where you are completely immersed in virtual worlds, augmented reality (AR) means that virtual elements are projected into the real environment. Schmalstieg has been working on this ""augmented reality"" for almost 30 years.

The researcher believes that AR glasses could shape everyday life in the future in the same way that smartphones do today. ""We're all constantly staring at these small screens. But cell phones are very limited when it comes to making information accessible."" Take online shopping, for example. If someone wants to buy a cushion cover for their sofa, they can turn the product around on the screen and enlarge it. Or they alternate between looking at the real sofa and the virtual object and try to imagine whether the two fit together. But the spatial context is missing: The virtual cushion placed as a 3D object on the real sofa. This leap into three-dimensional viewing can be achieved using AR glasses. ""They offer a higher quality, more comprehensible user experience than cell phones - simply because objects that are best displayed spatially can be viewed in this way.""

The Humboldt professor is currently working on an AR application that helps with assembling pieces of furniture, such as chests of drawers. If you are careless and twist the boards by 180 degrees, the drill holes no longer fit - everything has to be unscrewed again. The application is specifically designed to detect such errors, ensuring they're caught early - this makes life a lot easier, says Schmalstieg.

AR as a problem solver - even for future construction practices

When is an AR application good? When virtual reality merges with the real environment in such a way that it seems to belong there. This photorealism is known from special effects in films. However, Schmalstieg highlights an increased necessity for research aimed at enhancing information comprehensibility. This is about problems that cannot be solved by simply looking at something. On construction sites, for example, AR glasses can provide valuable services by rendering visible what would otherwise remain unseen to the naked eye. They can show where cables run in the wall or ceiling and whether electricity is flowing through them. Or they display virtual safety lines that must not be crossed.

Schmalstieg will work in the Cluster of Excellence ""Integrative Computational Design and Construction for Architecture"" (IntCDC) at the University of Stuttgart, where he will develop an AR application for robot-assisted house construction. Building designs are becoming increasingly complex; new timber construction techniques, for example, require a very high degree of precision, explains the researcher. Humans are becoming more and more dependent on the cooperation of robots - and this is exactly where AR smart glasses come into play. ""When humans and robots work together, good coordination is required. Humans must understand what the robot is doing, and vice versa. AR smart glasses excel in facilitating this human-machine interaction. They provide information about everything important that is happening on the construction site.""

Schmalstieg wants his applications to help people cope better with everyday life and work. ""I am not responsible for assessing technological impact. But because I'm dealing with human-machine interfaces, I must also consider what role humans play in the equation. Whether the technology I develop has a certain value.""

Uncomfortable devices

What happens next? AR and virtual reality have existed as business models for several years and tech companies have been marketing smart glasses for over a decade. Are they on the edge of a breakthrough? Schmalstieg believes that, sooner or later, ""radical change"" will come. ""Then it will be normal to wear smart glasses. After all, we all want to access mobile information at any time. In the long term, cell phones won't be able to keep up with smart glasses."" However, for these technologies to truly permeate everyday life, they must also be affordable, lightweight, and convenient. There is still a lot of work to do, says the Humboldt professor. Some of the current devices are a little heavy on the nose.

A court hearing today decided the heinous incest monster can leave his high-security jail cell despite the Austrian sex offender, 89, still serving a life sentence for keeping his daughter as a sex slave.

Although he can be moved from Stein prison in Krems an der Donau to a normal jail, he has been denied hope of any early release because of his ""unprecedented criminal energy"".

Krems an der Donau Regional Court revealed the new verdict by a panel of three judges today following a closed hearing on April 30.

A court had first ordered the transfer on the basis Fritzl no longer posed any threat.

But in March, the decision to move Fritzl was overturned - and the case was sent back to the Krems court for a new hearing.

Judges ruled that Fritzl would not be released but his transfer to a regular prison would ""cause no danger"".

They said the move would be for a 10-year probationary trial period but declared there was no case to free him into the community.

The ruling said ""the prisoner's dangerousness has been reduced and no criminal offence with serious consequences is to be expected any more"".

But the judges warned that Fritzl's ""criminal energy"" prevented early release from jail.

The monster has reportedly already ""packed his bags"" and had been preparing to leave the prison's secure psychiatric wing even before the court's decision was confirmed.

Fitting his belongings into two sports bags, Fritzl is reportedly taking only a few books, a typewriter, pens, notepads, and some items of clothing.

He is expected to leave the Stein as soon as possible.

He was even said to be hoping to travel to England to meet King Charles soon.

Fritzl once revealed he dreamed of Britain's ""spectacular scenery"" while watching a documentary about Shakespeare in his high-security prison.

He recalled: ""I was filled with this wonderful, uplifting feeling, this sense of inspiration for this fantastic culture.

""And it was then I knew that when I get released, it is not Austria I want to stay, rather I want to emigrate to the UK.""

James Cleverly promised to oppose the Austrian monster's desire to move to the UK if he ever gets free.

The decision about where Fritzl will spend the rest of his life is said to have already been made, reports Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung

He was exposed in 2008 for his heinous crimes against his daughter and grandchildren and jailed a year later.

Fritzl admitted fathering seven children with his daughter Elisabeth in an underground dungeon where he held her prisoner for 24 years.

The monster repeatedly raped and abused his daughter who gave birth to seven babies during her capture.

One tragically died at birth due to breathing difficulties as Fritzl heartlessly tossed the tiny corpse into a furnace.

Three others were brought up in the horrific basement with their mother as the remaining trio were allowed to venture out of the hellhole and were watched over by Fritzl and his unaware wife.

In his bombshell trial in 2009, the evil Austrian pleaded guilty to rape, false imprisonment, manslaughter by negligence and incest.

The perverted pensioner became eligible for parole in March after 15 long years locked up under Austria's rather lenient sentencing laws.

He was kept inside the high security jail despite his parole date being set as the decision to move him to a normal jail was overturned.

In January, Fritzl was pictured smirking as he dramatically won his bid to be moved to a regular prison.

Inmates who are judged as ready for parole can be freed depending on their conduct and mental and physical condition.

Fritzl, who has repeatedly asked to be released, had his case reviewed by justice and prison officials who made the final decision.

As well as suffering from Alzheimer's he is also said to be so frail he needs a walking frame to get around.

Adelheid Kastner, one of Austria's most renowned psychiatrists, has reportedly deemed Fritzl no longer a threat to society.

Fritzl was previously granted a conditional release which was later overturned by the Vienna Higher Regional Court.

The court said there are more facts needed before such a decision can be made.

Fritzl, who changed his name to Mayrhoff in an alleged attempt to evade physical attacks by other inmates, has reportedly applied for an early release several times in the past two years.

The monster's daughter Elisabeth was forced to spend 24 years locked up in Fritzl's hellish prison in Amstetten.

The evil man went on to rape her over 3,000 times in the dirty and rat-infested bunker.

He would also beat and kick her and force her into degrading acts - including re-enacting scenes from violent porn films, it was claimed.

The nightmare saw Fritzl threaten the trapped family members if they tried to escape as he punished them by switching off the electricity.

They only managed to escape after eldest daughter Kerstin fell critically ill in 2008.

Fritzl, who changed his name to Mayrhoff in an alleged attempt to evade physical attacks by other inmates, has reportedly applied for an early release several times in the past two years.

The monster's daughter Elisabeth was forced to spend 24 years locked up in Fritzl's hellish prison in Amstetten.

The evil man went on to rape her over 3,000 times in the dirty and rat-infested bunker.

He would also beat and kick her and force her into degrading acts - including re-enacting scenes from violent porn films, it was claimed.

The nightmare saw Fritzl threaten the trapped family members if they tried to escape as he punished them by switching off the electricity.

They only managed to escape after eldest daughter Kerstin fell critically ill in 2008.

Despite trying to argue he was trying to be a protective father, Fritzl was sentenced to life in prison in 2009.",thescottishsun.co.uk,news,The Scottish Sun,"Georgie English, Juliana Cruz Lima",-0.3725490196078431,453379891,5,https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-sdt9uuqax-1714465751227.jpg?1715687433&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9565920

A research group from Switzerland's ETH Zurich has investigated the role of hydrogen storage in an electricity system with large hydropower resources such as that of Switzerland.

""The study goes in the direction of understanding when hydrogen could play a role when co-existing with hydropower and pumped-hydro, or more generally within the same market,"" corresponding author professor Paolo Gabrielli told pv magazine. ""This could happen under some scenarios.""

Switzerland currently has about 6.9 TWh of hydropower dams and 2.1 TWh of pumped-hydro storage that are built or under construction. The country's electricity system - including its energy transfer with neighboring Germany, France, Italy, and Austria - was simulated using the Nexus-e platform and optimized with a linear programming (LP) optimization model.

Using software simulation and optimization, the research team focused on the Swiss electricity sector as a case study. However, they say that it should provide general design guidelines and recommendations in similar environments

The academics evaluated the need for hydrogen storage under a few techno-economic and climate scenarios with changing variables. The analysis was performed for a few target years: 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050, with their respective development and demand scenarios. PV generation was considered to be 6.76 TWh in 2030, 19.56 TWh in 2040, and 31.66 TWh in 2050.

The meteorological year was set to either dry, wet, or humid, and load-shedding costs, ranging from €1,000 ($1,080)/MWh to €10,000/MWh. In addition, three scenarios were considered for the development of Swiss neighboring countries, as defined by the Ten-Year Network Development Plans (TYNDP): national trends, global ambition, and distributed energy scenarios.

In addition, the learning rate for hydrogen technologies was set to 5%, 12%, or 20%, and the net transfer capacity (NTC) ranged from 0% to 100%. An NTC of 100% corresponds to today's values, whereas an NTC of 0% corresponds to a self-sufficient Switzerland.

""Additionally, the following generator candidates are included in the scenarios as options for new investments,"" explained the scientists. ""(i) waste-to-energy plants: 12 units of 20 MW each; (ii) wind parks in 7 locations for a total of 1960 MW; (iii) batteries in 7 locations with a capacity of 100 MW/400 MWh each; (iv) gas combined cycle plants combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS): 28 units (in 7 locations) of 100 or 200 MW each for a total of 4200 MW; (v) hydrogen storage: 169 units, one at every considered node including the non-Swiss regions. The power used for water electrolysis can be generated by any of the electricity generation units.""

All of the different scenarios were analyzed by changing a single variable, while all other settings for the scenario were set by a reference scenario. In that reference scenario, the target year was set to 2050, the learning rate to 20%, and the NTC to 100%. The load-shedding cost was then set to €10,000/MWh, the meteorological year average, and the European development to global ambition.

""In the Swiss electricity sector, hydrogen storage plays no major role under most conditions, even when assuming favorable cost assumptions for hydrogen technologies,"" the researchers stressed. ""More specifically, no hydrogen storage is installed in Switzerland if reasonable energy interconnections are in place with neighboring countries. This applies even when considering dry years, where natural water inflows are scarce, and the contribution of the Swiss hydropower sector is reduced.""

However, the results also showed that hydrogen storage is installed when net transfer capacities between countries are reduced below 30% of current values and load shedding costs are above €1,000/MWh. ""In other words, hydrogen storage is a solution to ensuring self-sufficiency in a context where electricity exchanges with neighboring countries are not possible. However, this comes at the cost of very high electricity prices,"" they emphasized.

Their results were presented in the paper ""The role of hydrogen storage in an electricity system with large hydropower resources,"" published in the Energy Conversion and Management journal.",pv-magazine.com,news,pv magazine International,Lior Kahana,0.2705882352941176,453370613,13,https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-s2.0-S0196890424000712-ga1_lrg-280x280.jpg,eng-9561767

At one point a late-1970s leftover in its model plan, the G has rocketed in status to become one of its bestselling and most profitable -- and glitziest -- Benz vehicles.

It remains its most capable off-roader, no question: with three differential locks, nine forward gears, plenty of inches of ground clearance, and hundreds of pound-feet of torque it generates as much good trouble as it has the ability to extract itself from. And that makes it irresistible for athletes, reality-TV characters, and content creators to be seen in one.

It's been a great success, and that universe can only expand with the 2025 G 580 with EQ Technology. With a hefty battery pack underneath, four motors, 579 hp, and heritage that shames Rivian, Hummer, and especially the Cybertruck, the electric G-Class promises freedom from pavement, all courtesy of battery power.

It also proves out, Benz believes, the wisdom of its quest to eventually electrify every classic model line it builds.

""If the G can go electric,"" Mercedes marketing vice president Bettina Fetzer told a group during a background session a week before this test drive, ""any car can go electric.""

I'll never become Internet-famous for owning one, not at the G's starter-home prices, not for all the lip filler in L.A. County. But I do have one step up on the celebs lining up for one now.

I've driven it already.

For the gas-powered Gs, this year brings more of a mid-life update than a full rethink. It remains a ladder-framed, five-seat SUV that sits at the pinnacle of off-road capability, thanks to everything that sits beneath its box-tastic body.

In the G 550, the former twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 drops out, while a 3.0-liter turbo-6 drops in, teamed to a 9-speed automatic. With 443 hp, it's 27 hp stronger than the old V-8 and thanks to a standard 48-volt mild-hybrid system, it can top that off with an additional 20-hp and 184 lb-ft of boost when it launches from a stop, or during other high-load situations. The independent front suspension and live rear axle still adopt adaptive dampers. Ground clearance still posts up at 9.5 inches, at a minimum, and fording depth lets it trudge through up to 27.6 inches of water.

Over a road course circling the town of Narbonne, France, the G-Class smoothed out its farm clothes, revealing a vehicle that's not changed much dynamically since we drove the newly reinvigorated 2019 G-Class in the same part of the world. It's been mildly updated outside with bits designed for the electric G, including side fairings and a windshield-header spoiler for better airflow.

As for the interior, the dashboard gets illuminated air vents and a steering wheel with capacitive touch controls, and twin 12.3-inch screens that display gauges and infotainment -- as well as the Offroad Cockpit, which spreads information about vehicle tire pressure, altitude, steering angle, and differential locks across its combined span. In addition, camera views stitch together to give the driver a view of what's going on under the front end and by the wheels to aid navigation through tight, rocky trails. All else feels familiar in look and feel.

On a moderately challenging path laid out on an ascent toward power-producing windmills, the G 550 picked through grunky rubble in its usual steadfast way. Incredibly smooth and capable, it encouraged tapping the diff-lock buttons like piano keys, while the views from the Offroad Cockpit spun and lit like one of the more classy casinos. I leaned forward in the seat to avoid pistoning while we yumped over protruding rocks that barely grazed the skid plates. The sturdy outfitting almost puts people out of work: in another off-road era, we'd have needed a navigator, a spotter, and someone to come reel us in when we cut a tire sidewall on a rock.

There was much less need for concern on the street loop that followed. The turbo-6 spins up in whorled of incredibly smooth torque, while the G 550's multi-contour seats pumped up their bolsters as the G's weight shifted into the steeply curved roads that link the lakes and valleys of this corner of Occitanie. The power delivery's not so different from the former V-8, and neither is the manner in which the G 550 bounds over dodgy runs, leaning and bracing its passengers from harsh transitions.

Not every gas-powered G-Class has an inline-6. The rorty twin-turbo V-8 lives on in the G 63, fleshed out with a vibrant and husky soundtrack to the tune of 585 hp, shifted through a 9-speed automatic. With the same 48-volt mild-hybrid system as the G 550, the AMG G 63 might be slightly more efficient than before, but it's hard to notice as it lurches then rockets to 60 mph in as little as 4.3 seconds, stretching its legs toward a 149-mph top end.

On the same road loop, its V-8 remained very much a talker: it burbled and blatted feedback from throttle inputs, muted when you're on the inside but without subtlety if you're perched by its exhaust tips. Watch it peel out of a parking lot and hear its Jurassic roar, and there's little doubt which G-Class it is.

Then, I dove into the valley loop with gusto. The G-Class's new electrohydraulic Active Ride Control suspension didn't get fazed. Its channels of hydraulic fluid build pressure against body lean where a torsion bar normally would limit movement; Mercedes says it's faster to respond, allows for wider spring tuning, and permits a softer ride. With three different levels of actuation in the G-Class's drive modes (which add two with Active Ride Control), the system grants the AMG G 63 much improved body control. Much of the head toss I've felt in older G-Classes has been filtered off, and it's much easier to drive quickly when the conditions allow it. Its electric power steering acts more precisely as the suspension squares better against the road, and while you'd probably pick something better suited to go faster on skinnier roads, this one will do it.

Take it to a special high-speed off-road loop, as I do after a gut-shaking demo lap from a pro Benz driver, and the G 63 becomes a maul that splits muck from rock at unimaginable speeds. The lap time's pegged at about three minutes and my test pilot hammers at it until we slide a third of the way around at the rear. While the trick suspension charms the bumps from the pavement, it also grants better wheel articulation -- while the G 63's collection of drive modes and functions lets traction and stability control fade out of the picture. Jouncing, flouncing, sliding, veering, bouncing, I learn how Samsonite luggage feels when it's flung into planes now. It's the best three minutes I have all week. For the moment.

I'm laughing at the whole ridiculous idea of a 6,000-pound SUV doing all of this, or needing to do this, but not when it's my turn to do this. Not when my co-pilot turns traction control down to a 3, and the G 63 AMG wags its tail like a newborn guppy through an off-camber descent. I slide through turns, wait a half-century for the wipers to clear the tidal wave of muck kicked onto the flat windshield, and peg it again, then position it for a hillclimb.

The instructor says to step it up to 80 kph (50 mph) for the next crest. I'm a people-pleaser so I flick it up to 90 kph (56 mph) -- and we soar over a jump spot, airborne for a moment, then touch down with a slightly squirrely motion at the rear. Pigs may not be able to fly, but the G 63 AMG can, to the mild consternation of all.

But if it's stunts you want, there's no multi-trick pony on Earth that delivers what the new battery-powered G 580 with EQ Technology can. Just a week prior, I had stood on the shore of the Beverly Hills reservoir when it bowed as Travis Scott rapped a half-hour set from the roof of the vehicle while Bradley Cooper chilled on a banquette and George Russell stood a half-yard away. Now who's spinning in the new electric G-Class first?

Anyone worried that battery power would reduce the G-Class to a shrinking showpiece should check the board. Electricity gives it a new edge, not just in quiet enjoyment of the world beyond the road, but in the neater moves it can execute to avoid ruining that same landscape.

With the same body and ladder frame, the electric G 580 folds in a 116-kw lithium-ion battery housed between ladder rails and covered by a thick carbon-infused plate. With 216 cells, 12 modules, two layers, and three cooling circuits, it pumps up the G-Class to roughly 6,800 pounds compared to about 5,500 pounds for a G 550 (there's no tow hitch; any pulled vehicle would put it into the same weight class as the Hummer EV). U.S. EPA-rated range should check in at about 240 miles, and with 200-kw charging it should take just over a half-hour to refill from 20-80%. Mercedes doesn't plan for a custom off-road charging network, but the electric G will get a NACS charging port soon.

A quartet of 108-kw electric motors puts out 579 hp and 859 lb-ft of torque, and each gets its own transmission for a true low-range mode. The electric motors also eliminate the need for locking differentials since each wheel's torque can be controlled individually. The specs end up in sync with the AMG 63: the G 580 hits 60 mph in less than 4.7 seconds, though top speed gets capped at 112 mph.

An hour's street drive warms the impression of the battery swap. It's hushed, of course, and the heft of the pack works in concert with the suspension's adaptive dampers and DeDion tube (swapped in for a rigid axle link, to clear the rear motor) to mute even more swells in the pavement. It steps away strongly, and in the background, the so-called ""G-Roar"" subs in electronic sounds that evoke but don't mimic those of a V-8.

A smart regenerative braking setup gathers information about cornering angle and speed to redirect energy back into the battery during deceleration; paddle controls flip that Auto mode into a D+ mode that delivers minimal regen, while Normal and D- and D- - modes boost it successively, though they come up shy of full one-pedal driving. The friction brakes have hydraulic assist, and in combination with 265/60R18 tires and a Normal drive mode, the G 580 has a very SUV-like turning radius of 44.6 feet.

The key specs, though, tell a promising story: Ground clearance between the axles of the G 580 EQ stands at least at 9.8 inches. It offers a breakover angle of 20.3 degrees, an approach angle of 32.0 degrees, and a departure angle of 30.7 degrees.

The priorities get clear when the electric G-Class heads for trails. Open its windows and enjoy some silence. It's so quiet, I can hear almost three feet of water splursh up against its door panels while we cruise through the aftermuck of heavy spring rains. It can ford more than 33 inches of water, better than the standard G, and it bounds around the same trails that the gas-powered models handle with ease, unworried over the occasional impacts against its carbon underside.

Much of the electric G's behavior gets governed by drive modes tuned by extensive prep work on the same paths as the other models. It's been tested on the same mountain trails at Austria's Schöckl as the standard G-Class, and there and here, the electric G's off-road cruise control sets it up for low, variable, and fast off-road crawl capability of up to 5 mph, all engineered through precise motor control. It's undeterred by scarring stones that crop up into the path, and the cruise modes allow off-road driving to mostly be watched over by the driver with a flick or three of the paddles.

The usual on-road Comfort, Sport, and Individual drive modes join with Trail and Rock programs, and it's the latter one that engages with the G 580's most cunning stunts. Rock mode permits Low mode, which reduces each wheel's gear ratio to 2:1 and limits speed to about 53 mph. From there, G-Steering takes just the tap of a button. Come to a tight bend in the trail with no place for a K-turn? Flick it on, and the all-wheel-steering system slashes turning radius as long as the surface isn't too grippy. I slid around a tree trunk stuck in the neck of the road, while a gas-powered follow vehicle had to pick around the bend carefully. Ithen whipped it through a coned slalom by making sloppy full-lock cranks at the wheel and letting it pivot itself through knots. It's a machine that begs to slide where it looks like it shouldn't.

Then I reach the open dirt field where I can give one final spin -- a literal 360, or 720, in truth. On low-friction level surfaces the G 580 signs off on electric superiority with G-Turn. Rivian's similar Tank Turn feature was canceled due to environmental concerns, while the GMC Hummer EV and the related Sierra EV have a CrabWalk setup for diagonal driving. G-Turn outspins them. In D, with Rock and Low modes selected, a full crank of the steering wheel and a press on the accelerator pivots the SUV in a tight circle, almost like a skid-steer, permitting two complete revolutions.

In a moment and without much prep at all, I put the SUV into G-Turn mode and centrifuge myself into a spasm of laughs. I've slid around cars on ice before, but nothing prepared me for the dizzying loops that happen without fuss. I hold down the paddle, then mat the accelerator, and it skid-steers around in a nearly perfect circle, two full rotations before it locks down the system. It's a vehicular party trick for the ages, and one that simply underscores how capable the battery-electric G is.

It's nothing less in the luxury department, either. Riding on a 113.8-inch wheelbase, at 182.0 inches long, 76.0 inches wide, and 78.2 inches tall, the G EQ ladles on the electronica among its usual power features, open-pore wood and leather trim, and ambient lighting. It lights up a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 12.3-inch touchscreen for infotainment, with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Standard safety features include adaptive cruise control, active lane control, active steering with blind-spot monitors, and automatic parking. Its electronic architecture does not support Level 3 Drive Pilot, however. Add on Burmester sound, twin 11.6-inch rear-seat displays, a dashcam, and a wireless charging pad if you like, or 20-inch wheels, running boards, and a package that lights the star logo, the model name, and the EQ badge.

The electric G-Class arrives at dealers late this year. Prices haven't been confirmed, but it's likely the G 580 with EQ Technology will cost more than $150,000 -- possibly as much as $200,000 based on European prices already announced, or even a quarter-million once it's upfitted and customized as many will be.

Surely few of its drivers will object to the price. Sticker shock is for other people. A quarter-million for what's sure to become one of the most coveted celebrity cars in history? Maybe a quarter-million isn't enough.",motorauthority.com,news,Motor Authority,Martin Padgett,0.3411764705882352,453334164,1,https://images.hgmsites.net/hug/mercedes-benz-g-class_100929245_h.webp,

Agriculture or renewable sources of energy - in the past, it was either, or. Agricultural PV is a new, innovative approach offering promising options for agriculture and climate protection by joining agricultural production and the generation of electricity on the same surface.

Extensive subsidies

European countries such as Germany and France subsidize agricultural PV with the aim of deploying more solar energy while reducing the competition for land use. Germany has introduced a separate auction segment with a top value for ""special solar installation"" (which includes agricultural PV installations) in the Solar Package 1, and France is deemed one of the pioneers for dedicated legislation. Other countries, such as Austria and the Netherlands, also promote their agricultural PV sector.

Benefits of agricultural PV

The advantages of dual land use are obvious: It reconciles solar energy with agriculture, and the protection against storm, hale, frost and draft adds an extra bonus for farmers. The electricity production costs are lower than from small roof-mounted installations, and farmers' income is diversified. Shading and wind protection provided by solar panels reduces evaporation, and innovative solar panels have been developed that also collect rainwater for irrigation. This can benefit farming operations by boosting their resilience against crop failure.

Best practice projects

Pilot projects are emerging all over Europe. In the Dutch local authority of Meierijstad, for example, BayWa re AG and its subsidiary GroenLeven are implementing a pioneering agricultural PV project, an 8.7 megawatt peak solar installation covering a vast raspberry plantation. On Sicily, figs and olives grow between the module rows of Europe's largest agricultural PV plant. In Neißeaue, Germany, Next2Sun Technology works on a 20 megawatts solar farm with vertical modules.

Intersolar Europe 2024: special attention on agricultural PV

Intersolar Europe is putting a particular focus on agricultural PV. A special exhibit in the Outdoor Area will be dedicated to the topic. Partners of the special exhibit are BayWa AG, BayWa re, Conexio PSE, Vista Geo and ZIMMERMANN PV-Steel Group. What's more, of the more than 1,370 Intersolar Europe exhibitors, some 60 exhibitors will be showcasing agricultural PV products and solutions. Experts will dive deeper into the topic and offer even wider information at a number of sessions at the Intersolar Forum and the Intersolar Europe Conference.

Intersolar Europe

As the world's leading exhibition for the solar industry, Intersolar Europe demonstrates the enormous vitality of the solar market. For more than 30 years, it has been providing a networking opportunity for key players, focusing on the latest trends, developments and business models under the motto ""Connecting Solar Business"".

One of four recyclable cartonboard tray solutions to be introduced by Morrisons for its premium, core, and entry-level steak lines, the pack will apparently eliminate 250 tonnes of plastic per year from the retailer's supply chain. Graphic Packaging claims the premium trays are the 'first on the market' to incorporate its advanced photo-quality print technology on the face of the tray.

The pressed board vacuum skin (VSP) trays can be used in a wide range of fresh food applications, including deli meats, cheese, and fish.

The core range is produced with unbleached cartonboard, while the entry-level 'Savers' range is produced with bleached cartonboard. The pressed trays are vacuum sealed, said to offer shelf life equivalent to plastic, and run on Morrisons Manufacturing's existing equipment with no investment required.

Lauren Hutchinson, new business sales director, Trays & Cups at Graphic Packaging, said: ""This commercialization is the result of close collaboration between the Morrisons team and three of our sites - Winsford in the UK, and Lund and Tibro in Sweden. We combined the strength of our global network with a clear focus on local customer service to deliver tailored innovations that delivered packaging excellence to Morrisons and their consumers.""

Dan Barnes, procurement manager at Morrisons, added: ""We know British shoppers look for packaging that helps them reduce their plastic consumption while also providing quality and value in their purchases, and we're committed to delivering on these priorities. Our partnership with Graphic Packaging is a great one, as we worked towards our shared goal of delivering innovative, easily recyclable, cartonboard packaging that meets the needs of our consumers.""

Last month, Eastman and SEE (formerly Sealed Air) launched a lightweight, certified compostable tray, designed to replace traditional polystyrene foam alternatives in protein packaging applications. Made from wood pulp and acetyl from a portfolio of recycled material, the tray is certified as home compostable by TÜV Austria, and as industrially compostable by the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI).

Earlier in the month, ICA Sweden announced that Stora Enso's moulded wood fibre trays would be implemented for flowers in place of traditional polystyrene alternatives, claiming the transition will reduce CO2 emissions by up to 81%. The trays reportedly consist of 'sustainably sourced' Nordic wood fibre and are produced using 100% green electricity.

In a time of war, geopolitical tensions, and energy insecurities, Ukraine emerged as a shining example of resilience and unwavering determination this past winter, as it powered through the season, using only domestic gas sources for the first time in its history.

Supplying oil and gas equipment to Ukraine. As an American entrepreneur deeply engaged in Kyiv's oil and gas sector, I'm proud of my company's role in this endeavor. Vorex USA, headquartered in Erie, Pa., was the leading U.S. supplier of oil and gas equipment to Ukraine in 2023, fulfilling contracts worth over $100 million with Ukrainian state-owned Naftogaz. We collaborated seamlessly with partners in the U.S. and Kyiv, to facilitate the delivery of 30,000 tons of pipe and equipment to Ukraine amidst the backdrop of ongoing conflict.

The struggle to develop gas reserves. Ukraine's efforts to achieve energy security are the product of a decade-long struggle that began with Russia's early invasion of the country in 2014. Ukraine has some of the biggest reserves of natural gas in Europe, but it traditionally relied on Moscow for its energy needs. The country quit importing Russian gas in 2015, so Ukraine is ahead of the curve -- and ahead of Europe.

Today, the Ukrainian energy market is transformed: It is fully integrated with the natural gas and electricity markets of Europe, embracing European energy standards and regulations and completely independent of Russia. In fact, Ukraine's Transmission System Operator (TSO) recently said it planned to end its current Russian gas transit contract this year -- surely sooner than European countries had expected.

The EU can learn from Ukraine. But the EU lags Ukraine in crimping its consumption of Moscow's natural gas, which has remained fairly steady throughout the war. Though EU countries passed sanctions and swore off oil imports from Russia at the start of the current war in Ukraine, they continue to be highly dependent on Russian gas. According to statistics generated by the Reuters news agency, Moscow continued supplying about 15% of Europe's gas supply in 2023, in line with what it historically provided. The EU has pledged to quit its reliance on Russian natural gas by 2027, but that may not be soon enough: If Ukraine closes the pipe, several countries, including Austria and Poland, will be affected.

To be sure, closing the Ukraine pipeline is a daunting task. The interconnected nature of these pipelines is challenging -- Ukraine cannot simply shut the flow and strand its neighbors. And this is all happening as Russia is launching one of its largest missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

To navigate this transition, Ukraine will depend on companies like mine to deliver crucial assistance to the adaptation process. In collaboration with cGAS, a Polish company based in Rawicz, Vorex will deliver innovative solutions tailored to Ukraine's specific needs, including four Automatic Gas Distribution Stations, each boasting a capacity of 5,000 Nm3/h, to ensure TSO pipelines are ready for use after Russian transport. We are also providing ball valves and gas regulators from Italy, essential components for managing and controlling the flow of gas within the pipeline network.

Gains in Ukrainian gas production. The current conflict in Ukraine, which began with a full-bore Russian invasion in early 2022, laid bare critical vulnerabilities inherent in Europe's reliance on Moscow for natural gas and its pipeline network. But progress during wartime seems to be the way in Ukraine. According to S&P Global, Ukrainian gas production rose to 18.7 Bcm in 2023, up from 18.5 Bcm in 2022. While that is still lower than pre-war levels, the country didn't need any winter gas imports this season -- a signal achievement for a country in the throes of a full-scale foreign invasion.

Moreover, as Naftogaz duly reported recently, Ukraine has already brought five new wells online in 2024, including a new high-throughput gas production well producing more than 500,000 cmgd (17.6 MMcfgd).

What Ukraine has achieved holds potential lessons for the broader landscape of global energy security. According to the International Trade Commission, Ukraine boasts the third-largest natural gas reserves in Europe and possesses the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the transportation of gas to European markets. The country currently has some 5,000 producing gas wells, with another 5,000 wells depleted and sealed. The Commission reckons perhaps 1,000 of the shut-in wells could become productive again by deploying modern techniques. All told, the country has some 900 Bcm (31.8 Tcf) of gas reserves, the Commission says, much of it unexploited and the second largest stockpile in Europe.

Looking forward. Through a combination of strategic investments in technology, the establishment of a robust regulatory framework, and embracing innovation and entrepreneurship, Ukraine's energy sector is on solid footing, despite the threat of occupation by a hostile foreign power.

And there's more to come. I believe that when hostilities cease, Ukraine will be well-placed to export natural gas to its European neighbors, perhaps filling the void left by Moscow. Though the goal of the EU is to swear off Russian natural gas by 2027, I believe this can be accomplished sooner. And with smart planning and continued resource development, Ukraine could help eliminate the need for Russian energy and transit, ensuring a more resilient and sustainable energy future for Europe.",worldoil.com,news,World Oil,,0.1843137254901961,453311124,1,,eng-9560532

Bart Biebuyck, CEO of Green Energy Park with over 20 years of experience in the hydrogen industry, discusses how his company will do things differently.

Hydrogen is a somewhat elusive molecule to be used as fuel. While it is an extremely efficient and emissionless fuel, the sticking point has been the lack of infrastructure to support it, i.e. industries using hydrogen fuel, amount being produced, etc., as well as the emissions created in its production.

The Innovation Platform's Matt Brundrett sat down with Bart Biebuyck to talk about Green Energy Park, and what he thinks will be a future that will solve these issues in both hydrogen production, and supply and distribution. Bart, with his vast experience in the hydrogen industry, expands on his headship of a public private partnership with the European Commission, and explains how they will lead the way forward.

Green Energy Park is a vertically integrated company that focuses on the production of hydrogen and ammonia in the upstream. Then, in the midstream, bringing that to different consumers in the distribution channel, and finally in the downstream, delivering to the gate of companies. We strongly believe that being vertically integrated is the best way to create a sustainable, viable, and economical hydrogen economy because the hydrogen economy is not yet mature, so there are too many variables. Being completely vertically integrated is, in our opinion, the way forward.

And this is precisely what we are doing with Green Energy Park. That's why we are starting to build the world's largest hydrogen and ammonia production facility in Brazil; then, we will bring its product to various ports worldwide. We are in talks with several ports in Europe. We have our own European import terminal on the Croatian island of Krk. This is where we have the Green Energy Park Krk, and the other ports we are working with are in the UK, north and northwest Europe, and the Middle East and the Far East.

From there, we are in discussion with various customers that we will bring hydrogen and ammonia to. They are located in northern Italy, south Germany, Austria, the Balkan countries, Croatia, Hungary, and Slovakia. This is where we believe we must gradually build a sustainable hydrogen economy. Of course, more energy parks will be built in the future, and we are already in discussion with other locations worldwide about setting up similar hydrogen production facilities.

In Brazil, we found all the elements required to make what I believe will be the world's most affordable hydrogen and ammonia. We have a 100% green grid, a free trade zone, and a very close location to our brand-new port. We're going to operate the export terminal in the state of Piauí. On top of that, we have excellent support from the local government, which believes in hydrogen and has a hydrogen strategy.

Furthermore, many Brazilian developers have concrete plans to produce renewable energy from solar and wind, but do not find off takers as the grid already 100% green. We will enable them and receive electricity and renewables at a very sharp price. We also have access to fresh water as we are very close to a river. All those elements together mean we can produce hydrogen and ammonia at a very affordable price.

We also have a lot of land there; around 800 hectares of free trade zone for ourselves, and we will use around 310 hectares. That leaves space open for off-takers of the ammonia and hydrogen locally. I'm sure there might be other locations of interest in the future. But for the moment, we feel that all the elements are there in Piauí to make a sustainable business case for hydrogen.

The development will be across four phases. The first phase will construct a 1.8-gigawatt electrolyser starting operation in 2028. Then phase 2 will add another 1.8 gigawatts in 2030, another 1.8 gigawatts in 2032, and finally, we will add 5.4 gigawatts in 2035. The entire project will be fully operational by then, and will be a demonstration of how to make hydrogen economical.

We will produce around 2.4 million tonnes of hydrogen, leading to more than 10 million tonnes of ammonia, depending on the conversion rate and technology we use. We will deliver most of that to Europe because Europe is hungry for energy and needs to go green. Today, there are relatively few renewables available in Europe, so we need to bring these renewable electrons to Europe, which will be one of the biggest off-takers.

We are also looking to the UK, as they, too, are very energy-hungry. The Middle East may also be an exciting area to look at. It is generally believed that the Middle East will always export energy, and so far, they have done so, but I'm not sure that will always be the case. They will be competitive in their export of renewable energy versus other parts of the world. So, I could envision that the Middle East might import energy in the future and use it to create other added-value products. And then there is also the Far East. If you look at Japan, South Korea, Singapore, etc., they also need a lot of energy, especially renewable energy, so we are also looking at these markets.

Globally, there is a race to address climate targets. We need new technologies and a lot of renewables. We cannot decarbonise our entire society by electricity alone; we will also need molecules. There aren't many projects worldwide, at least at such a scale, that will produce a lot of green molecules, so to reach the government's 2035, 2040, 2050, etc. targets, current income streams are not enough if we want to become net zero. We will need to build many facilities to create green molecules and truly implement them as a part of decarbonisation pathways.

There are a lot of industries that cannot use electricity very easily and will need to use molecules for energy. A lot of the time, those are also the industries that are putting out a lot of emissions. If you look only at the steel industry, 7% of global CO2 emissions come from steel. Our project fits wonderfully with all of the aforementioned targets and will help governments' achieve their targets. Furthermore, our project is now part of the Global Gateway initiative. This is the European initiative undertaken by the EU Member States and the European Commission to build closer relationships with countries in Latin America and countries in Africa. Last year, the President of the European Commission went to Brazil and, in June, announced that they would invest in Brazil, including the hydrogen value chain. Thus, we are now one of the projects that are part of that hydrogen value chain in Brazil.

We are currently discussing the financial support we will receive under that framework. Other facilities are in operation in Brazil because of the innovation there. As such, we are also looking at funds that can help with the engineering activity we must undertake. Ultimately, we aim to deliver a hydrogen or ammonia price that is competitive with today's fossil-fuel-based prices once the project is completed and operational.

I strongly believe that we need to go in that direction and show that it's economical and viable. This is why, together with Green Energy Park's top-down team, including an engineering company, an EPCM company, and a solid financial company with a lot of experience, we have developed a business model, new engineering, and a new way of financing. It's quite an innovative business model, which is also part of our IP. When we explain that business model to various banks, be it private or institutional, they all love this new business model.

That's why I feel there is traction in the financial world. We have received a great deal of enthusiasm when discussing and demonstrating our method to build a viable and economical hydrogen economy. I have even had several people tell me I've cracked the code. Today, one of the biggest issues is that many projects do not reach FID because they have various issues with their business model.

We worked hard here because we have an in-house engineering company with one of the brightest engineers in Process Engineering, tank engineering, etc. Combined with brilliant people in the financial world, they came up with that very interesting model that got a lot of traction when tested in the financial world. And so, yes, we're likely to get a lot of development funding, but I think our new approach convinces many investors. I believe this is what was necessary. We cannot keep it business as usual and do things like we always have. You need to innovate, not only in engineering but also financially.

There's already a massive market for ammonia. Today, a lot of grey ammonia is being used worldwide; almost 200 million tonnes of ammonia consumption worldwide. However, this is from fossil-fuel-based ammonia. Of course, this needs to go green. I think there's not such a big problem with import/export or handling because the world knows how to deal with ammonia. There are a lot of skilled people and companies who know what to do, and that is part of our joint venture. They have built several ammonia terminals, including the biggest ammonia tank in operation in the world. The challenge is, of course, what do you do with the hydrogen? Making ammonia from hydrogen is a known technology. However, converting back to hydrogen is still a challenge, and technology is still being developed.

We believe our technology is quite innovative for ammonia cracking. Our cracking technology can also solve issues with exporting to different customers. Bringing hydrogen to your import terminal and then to the customer is challenging.

We all know that building a hydrogen economy will take a decade, if not more, before everything is in place. Plus, not all the big companies, or even small and medium enterprises, are located next to the backbone. A lot of work is still needed to bring the hydrogen to each of those companies. But with our technology and solutions, we have created a way to get hydrogen to companies' gates in a financially affordable way.

Green Energy Park Krk (GEPK) is a unique import facility. Krk is a Croatian island on the north side of the Adriatic Sea, the closest location to south Germany and northern Italy. GEPK is a 156-hectare brownfield plot that used to be an external chemical plant, which we can now use for the green energy future.

From GEPK, we can supply northern Italy, Austria, south Germany, the Balkan regions, and local markets like Croatia and Slovenia. At the moment, most European projects focus on Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and those ports. But south-central Europe is not as well supplied. So with Krk, which is uniquely located, we can supply those regions; there's a lot of interest.

Many companies are interested in supplying or sourcing green molecules from GEPK. What is beautiful is that our facility is also a port. We have 16m of natural depth; this is very important because ships carrying ammonia are heavier and need at least 14.5m of depth. We don't need to dredge, as it's a deep natural port. Furthermore, the port is in the Bay of Rijeka, meaning the waves are very moderate; there is no significant movement of sand or silt. This is also good for the shipments in terms of loading and unloading the shipping, as the ships do not rock much.

We also have a natural gas pipeline that is already hydrogen-ready. Once the Croatian government decides to stop natural gas and switch to hydrogen, we can immediately inject it from our side because the gas pipeline starts and runs on our side. Therefore, GEPK is already a part of the European hydrogen economy. In the future, there will also be a direct rail connection to the other side and the possibility of a pipeline going towards the refineries on the other side of the bay. So there are a lot of potential off-takers in the neighbourhood, as well as the potential to get hydrogen in large volumes off the island to major regions like northern Italy and south Germany.

I've already worked in the hydrogen industry for more than 20 years. I started my career at Toyota Motor Europe on the design team for the first Toyota hydrogen car, the Mirai. I worked with my team on the Mirai for more than seven years, ensuring it was ready for the European market. I also built, the first hydrogen refuelling station in Belgium, over ten years ago. At that time, there was little talk about hydrogen power and little knowledge among hydrogen authorities. A lot of education was needed for all different stakeholders. But we built it, and it's still operational today.

After we launched the Mirai and opened the hydrogen refuelling station, I had the opportunity to go to the European Commission to be the head of the world's biggest hydrogen and fuel cell research programme. And so I was heading a €2.4bn research programme for seven years. I think we financed more than 1,100 companies in the field of hydrogen fuel cells; a total of around 360 projects in the meantime received funds. It was an exciting environment to work in because you saw all the latest technology, which technology works, which technology needs some development before it works, etc., so I learned a lot.

For me, it was essential to demonstrate how to make the hydrogen economy a reality. Every week, I saw companies coming up with projects and PowerPoints. But if you look at the latest IEA report, there are probably around 1,400 projects worldwide in hydrogen and fuel cells, and only 3.6% get FID; it made me a bit sad. However, I also embraced the challenge to show the world how we can realise a hydrogen economy. To achieve this, after leaving the European Commission in May last year, I started Green Energy Park Global with my team, who truly are the best of the best.

With a big, well-known engineering company, a well-known EPC company and somebody who saw everything in the financial world, together we set out to show the world how we can reach climate goals because to reach the 1.5 degrees climate target in 2050, we need to build about 6,000 gigawatts-worth of electrolysers to produce all the hydrogen and ammonia, or methanol that we need to decarbonise our economy. That's a huge amount. Currently, the biggest electrolyser in operation in Europe is 20 megawatts, a fraction of what we need. And we have just 25 years to build 6,000 gigawatts of renewables and electrolysers, a massive challenge for humanity.

I want to contribute by showing a way forward and making hydrogen an economically viable case. And I'm thrilled that we succeeded. Of course, a lot still needs to be built, but as I said before, we are checking our model and designs because our engineers have already started designing a large part of our plot. When we show it to strategic partners, companies that have worked for years in this field, or investment banks, they say it's fantastic. One CTO of a large company said: ""Every day, I see presentations, and every week, some developers and companies show me their plans on hydrogen and ammonia. But this is my first time seeing something that might actually work."" I think it's clear that we are on the right track to deliver a method that can accelerate the entire hydrogen industry and reach the 6,000 gigawatts required by 2050.",innovationnewsnetwork.com,news,Innovation News Network,Megan Traviss,0.3098039215686275,453302617,6,https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ZAKARAS1-29179-shutterstock_Deemerwha-studio_2311223577.jpg,eng-9561767

The conclusions, seen by Reuters, said the Commission should then ""look for ways to increase overall financing for electricity grid infrastructure"".

European Union countries will ask Brussels to find ways to increase funding for power grids, as concerns mount that ageing electricity infrastructure could hamper Europe's green goals, a draft document showed.

Europe's plans to shift to clean energy will require a huge expansion of power grids, transforming the network to connect consumers to massive new offshore wind farms, fleets of local solar panels, and install millions of charging stations for electric vehicles. EU countries will ask the European Commission to assess how current EU funds available for power grids compared with the - far bigger - actual investment needs, and produce guidance on how to use more EU funds for grid projects, according to draft conclusions for a meeting of EU energy ministers on May 30.

The conclusions, seen by Reuters, said the Commission should then ""look for ways to increase overall financing for electricity grid infrastructure"". The document called on the European Investment Bank to also strengthen its support for power grid projects - including by de-risking projects to help attract private finance.

Current investments in grids lag far behind the 584 billion euros per year the EU says is needed to meet green goals. The EU added dozens of power grid projects last year to a list of schemes eligible for fast-tracked permits and certain EU funds.

Kristian Ruby, secretary general of industry group Eurelectric, said more needed to be done to speed up investments and avoid a situation where newly-built green energy projects have to wait years to be connected to ailing power networks. ""We need to make sure that there is an active incentive for the grid operators to make use of public funds,"" he said.

More than 35,000 power plants requested new connections to Austria's power grid in 2022, for example - more than three times the number received in 2021, with most requests coming from solar plants. Diplomats said one issue proving particularly difficult among EU governments was how they should share the costs of massive new power projects - such as offshore wind farms - designed to feed electricity to multiple countries.

Romantsova","What is the state of human rights regarding the aggression by Russia against Ukraine in early 2024?

*Further original, internal sources are at the bottom of the article.*

*Interview conducted April 16, 2024.*

Ms. Oleksandra Romantsova is the Executive Director (2018-present) of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 under her and others' leadership in documenting war crimes. This will be a live series on human rights from a leading expert in an active context from Kyiv, Ukraine. Here, we talk about updates from February 5 to April 16.

Scott Douglas Jacobsen: Okay, so today, we are here for our fourth interview with Oleksandra Romantsova of the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, Ukraine. We have been covering the human rights aspects or facets of the Russo-Ukrainian war based on Russian aggression into Ukraine starting, in terms of a full-scale invasion, on February 24, 2022. I am based out of nearby Montreal, Quebec, Canada, so the time zones are more helpful this time than from Vancouver. Our last interview was February 5. So, we will start with the reportage from that time and continue forward from there. I will begin with a general sense. What have been some of the changes in tactics and some of the newer human rights trends you have noticed in the Spring of 2024 so far?

Oleksandra Romantsova: First of all, that was the opening of the second warrant of the chief of the army of the Russian Federation about shelling the civilian system. One of them made some little breaks, which was interesting. When you have this break, nobody attacks you via rockets. You are thinking about when they start to do that. It started months before. Now, it is the middle of April. That was the middle of March. They started shelling every day, during the day. It can be 50 rockets, some drones, or something like that. If something happened in Kyiv, then this means something happened in Dnipro, Zapirozhzhia, Mykolaiv, and other places. So, the main change is that they attack concrete electricity systems. They stopped doing that. We waited in the Winter because it is usually more painful without electricity, but they started in the Spring. Before that, Ukraine was a big country that produced much electricity. We sell it. We have many rivers with the stations. They try to destroy bigger stations. Which is called Dnipro station [Ed. Dinpro hydroelectric dam], these systems are regularly attacked now.], It was built during the Soviet Union. Before, there was an explosion by Hitler's army. So, for image, it is a wrong decision for the Russian military to try and destroy it. They supply a few rockets to them. However, it still works now. They have some images, but not crucial. They are trying to stop Ukraine, try not to allow us to have businesses, economics - any processes. Things people can need or want: leave Ukraine, etc. I do not know the main idea behind this targeting. People will speak about fighting. The more problems we have, the less support we have from the US, and the fewer shells we have. If they figure out the channels and what they are trying to do, they will put much effort into propaganda in the United States. They want to show it is not an important question - Ukraine - and Israel is more important. The US is totally in the process of election now. They are not so quick to make this decision. This means we are prepared to fight but do not have enough arms. That is a big problem. It is a big problem for us because it means that every day, people die there on the frontline. People are dying here because we do not have enough shells. We do not have enough shells to destroy their rockets, which they send to our cities. We know that. We have the skills, but we do not have the tools to implement what we know. It is the situation. This means that things have changed a lot inside Ukraine. It is primarily a reaction to that.

Jacobsen: What about the European Union providing finance, shells, and fighter jets?

Romantsova: The European Union decided to support us, meaning they will start producing more shells and can help us after a year. We must survive this year without enough shells, so that is the problem.

Jacobsen: With regards to the gridlock happening in a lot of American political cycles, is it more or less accurate when Zelensky states that if the United States does not support Ukraine with more resources, the Russian Federation is likely to take much Ukrainian territory if not win the war against Ukraine? [Ed. The new bill was passed on April 20, 2024, to support Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. Likewise, The Associated Press reported on ways military aid can be expedited. The expectation is a giant spring of aggression by the Russian Federation forces. NATO and others look to air defences for Ukraine. Kremlin claims America is repeating Vietnam-like humiliation, and more deaths will follow the aid package.]

Romantsova: Good question. The biggest problem is that people forget about the situation. The situation can get worse, not better. It is not a good position for politicians. People think of the Ukrainian war as a usual thing. Some politicians state this as a typical war, a usual thing. They say, ""Ukrainians will fight. It will be long. So, Ukrainians can do that alone."" However, we cannot... we can be finished. All of us who stay here will fight. All who do not will not prepare to continue to fight. They will start just going to other countries. It creates a crisis. Even certain millions of people are not easy for Europe; this makes them less and less comfortable. Is it possible Ukraine will fall? Yes, it is possible. It means all of us will be dead. It is impossible to have a miracle. Something is blowing up in the political system of the Russian Federation. If it happens, all of us will be surprised. It is not exactly what you can plan. You can say, ""Everyone, we planned that. We account for that or something like that."" No, we have one chance. It will be fought until the Russian Federation breaks down at the economic or political level, but it will not take one month. It takes years. That is why, for us, it is essential to remember the USA. It is not a question that some Ukrainians ask more than others. It is a question: If Ukraine will lose, it will be a problem for all of Europe. Some countries like Hungary or Slovenia have started collaborating with Russia. It is not so big, the castle. It can be the point of turn that can be a game changer. Although this situation is game-changing, it can be like this now. That is why we speak with Americans; even Europe will start to support us with the same money. However, you cannot shoot with cash. It would help if you hit with guns. So, we need guns. Most of the guns that we need are in America. As you know, the Canadian army cannot help.

Jacobsen: No, they have been in a tough spot now. They have also been shrinking for a while, even within an infusion of over $70 billion over several years [Ed. Two decades.]. The Canadian army is in a tough spot ethically and politically. Even though Canadian citizens who are not serving members will give contradictory or seemingly conflicting responses in surveys, on the one hand, Canadians will want Canadian forces to be more active in international affairs. Still, most do not want to serve in the first place. Fundamentally, they want to help other nations with their problems, but they do not want to be the ones troubled with helping those problems. There are violations of the rights of men and women in service. Internationally, in terms of NATO commitments, because we were well below even the minimum standard of relative GDP contribution (2%) to the Canadian Armed Forces, we may send 1,500 service members to Latvia; however, in general, we are pretty limited in our contributions internationally, except, maybe, in training, where we might train Ukrainian captains in French. Also, we have ancient equipment across the board, from rifles to submarines. So, on the Canadian side, I would not expect significant contributions from the Canadian Armed Forces for some time.

Romantsova: Canada has provided good financial support. However, that is the problem. You cannot eat money. You cannot shoot money. You need money transformed into something. Most of the support for our budget is limited only to social needs. So, that means that is why Russia attacks concrete suppliers, power plants, etc. Because we need 40% of our budget, which is produced by our economy, in steel, only this 40% can be used for arms, guns, and supporting the army. All other support from outside of Ukraine has conditions. We can use it only for salaries and pensions. Stuff like this. That is why it is so important to get support from the USA; support from the USA was for arms. That is the difference.

Jacobsen: One political commentator in the United States commented on the effect of weakening an enemy or rival nation with violent intent while also supporting a country in need and a more robust and muscular ally, which is a win-win situation. Also, the creation of those arms strengthens the American economy. It would be a positive in general for the American State. Now, about the human rights conditions of citizens, the newer actions or the stronger push has been toward the targeting of critical infrastructure in Ukraine by Russian Federation forces. People probably will not see this video, but the lights are off in your place. They are not off in mine. Even in Kyiv, they are targeting electrical grids and stations. How is this change to try to terrorize the public even more, impacting the trends of fighting and then the morale of the public at large?

Romantsova: It is a good question. During this time, we have one month of changes to legislation for recruitment and mobilization to the army. Many people do not like these changes. A lot of these people do not like these changes. What other decision can be made? No, you are not like this. What do you propose as a way to do this? So, but still, as for me, it is understandable. All of us, my team, and I, have the opportunity to work only because people from frontlines support us. They help us because they defend us. We are here because it is not our turn to go to the frontline. Maybe it happened. Perhaps it happened that even such a person who does not have any war specialization or something needs to go to the frontline. It is possible. As for me, it is still a big question. How does the army need to be organized? What kind of solution? What kind of weapons? What type of ammunition do people need? Because we will always have fewer people than Russia because Russia is four times bigger by population and four times less attractive to save someone. So, they do not care. They may care about some generals or professionals but do not care about soldiers. So, they can send thousands of them to kill a few Ukrainians because for them... we see this the last ten years. They do not care even about their population. It is a big problem. We call this an asymmetric answer. So, if they have many soldiers, we must have a lot of technology, such as drones. A lot of this is not about human rights. It is tough to speak about human rights when you have such a situation with war and your situation of security. So, from our side, we have not changed from the other side.

People still give their donations and lots of donations. Ukrainians collect the money and send it to volunteers for the technology, which they believe supports our citizens on the front lines. Drones, for example, or 'a system of audio fighting,' may be translated like this. It protects soldiers from drones from the Russian side. It still happens through NGOs. Minister of Defense they have their process. However, they are still working through NGOs, just through NGOs.

Jacobsen: How is the public morale in Ukraine now? Does it vary by city, or is there a general high or a general low?

Romantsova: All of us are tired and depressed. However, it does not change the situation. Yes, we are pretty not the politest and kindest people now. When people speak about an attack in Moscow, we are not celebrating, but we are not waiting or something. Israel was attacked. I have friends in Israel. However, sorry, all of this rocket and shell was destroyed before. However, nobody does that for Ukraine, and it is every day. Missiles killed people. The USA still discusses whether they need to support Ukraine or not. It is terrible competition. It can lead to more suffering from some war or not. However, it is still emotionally hurtful when people say, ""Ukraine is one country to get attacked every day."" It is injustice.

Jacobsen: Is the general idea that the Russian Federation is planning a more protracted war, given that it contributes one-third of its expenditures to the military?

Romantsova: Nobody knows what kind of plan Russia has. I think they need some victory. However, tomorrow, Putin can say to his population. ""We have a victory,"" and then stop the war. He can imagine. He can make his propaganda make any picture. We try to guess. They send more and more signals, not directly to Kyiv, but to different international parties. They want to have a negotiation. Now, they are on the negotiation side. We would be strong enough. If they stop this line and lead by their control of more than 21% of our territory and more than 6,000,000 people for them, it will look good enough for them. For us, it is destroying any opportunity to bring back these people. We do not know how many lives are changed because Russians kill every day. It is the same thing. We do not see what happens with kidnappings. First of all, it is not a question. I do not have an answer. I have the purpose to fight. I do not know what the end will be -- peace for us. If we exist, it means they bring back all of our people and are protected from Russia. It is important. Ukrainians do not like fighting. Ukrainians fight because we have no other choice but to defend ourselves. We will stop the fight if someone proposes another way to define ourselves. I think it is okay for us to look to other situations. People need to be released. It is important.

Jacobsen: In late February, President Zelensky went to Saudi Arabia to push for peace in a push for POWs in Russia. How was the POW (prisoner of war) situation with Ukraine and Russia? Has anything gone forward about exchanges?

Romantsova: They (POWs) are still there. They have one or two exchanges. That is all. It begs the question about civilians. We do not have only prisoners like combatants who are going to become prisoners of war. Also, all the prisoners of war, when they return to us, are in bad condition. They torture them. It is a good question. The status of prisoners of war is a status in international humanitarian law, which needs to protect you if you recognize the other side, e.g., prisoners of war. They need to care about you, give you food and normal conditions, not extremely hot or cold. You need to get medicine support if you need it. It would help if you had the opportunity to make contact with your family. Russia does not do anything of that, mainly through an International Committee of the Red Cross. So, you can be judged through the court because you take the duty in the army. Russia breaks even this. So, they put them in jail, some prisoners. It is like a big argument from Russia's side when trading inside negotiations. That is why they take people. They only need the people to press Ukraine down for the arguments as to why their proposition needs to be taken. Until now, many NGOs here, every day, including prisoners of war and civilian prisoners, have different communication campaigns around the world about that. Still, it is a point number for politicians in policy. It is still painful here.

Jacobsen: What about the elections in the Russian Federation with these murders, etc.?

Romantsova: It is like the election of President Putin, which wins President Putin. It is not an election. For 20 years, the Russian Federation has not had any elections. It is like Belarus. Nobody believes it is an election. Navalny is trying to push it in some way to use the mechanisms. They are trying to use different tools to create some intrigue there. However, no, it is always the election of President Putin. Now, it is illegally recognized. They include in this election occupied territory, and they make this illegal process poison. The election will be the same with Lukashenko (Belarus). Lukashenko was not recognized for the last election. Putin, as I understood, the European Union has this position. I do not hear about the consensus of West's voices that now he is illegal. However, he still leads the Russian Federation.

Jacobsen: What about the UN nuclear watchdog director going to Moscow to discuss nuclear safety in Ukraine? Was there any result from that?

Romantsova: Nuclear safety in Ukraine is one of the most significant results, not because they released the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. They think it has much more of a role than India, China, and somebody from the West to stop something terrible from happening. Macron changed his position in this way. He started answering, ""Okay, you are not alone with nuclear weapons."" It is a significant change. It is not because of Ukraine. It is because Wagner made a problem for the French army. You feel that you live on a small, connected Earth. That is the source of my optimism. We are still determining what we will indeed get from the Russian Federation. If China changes some positions, Russia will finally need to take back their army.

Jacobsen: Since joining NATO and ending its post-WWII neutrality, has Sweden made any moves to help in the Ukrainian efforts?

Romantsova: Most neutrality is an official status of some states like Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and Turkmenistan. It is funny that Turkmenistan has an official neutral status. You must have special voting, call signs, and unique documents at the UN. Switzerland is trying to take it back. Russia said they are an unfriendly country now since membership of NATO. Unless they lose it. In Europe, Austria stays in this status. Now, it is a big, big question. Maybe countries from Asia, Africa, etc., can take a spot. We are not counting this country. So, we are still looking to the West - America, Canada, maybe Germany, but we are not looking to other countries like Brazil, Argentina, or South Africa. These countries are in Africa. We are waiting, growing up, and starting a dialogue with all of these countries. They will not consistently be grown. A lot of them began to shoot during the negotiation. If African countries exist without any government but have an army and, sometimes, more arms than the Czech Republic or Poland, it is a huge question about the biggest problem that we still have. This terroristic act on the city hall near Moscow. It is part of this. They show this exactly when the Russian Federation is trying to concentrate its power and systems in Ukraine. They are open and vulnerable to other problems. Islamistic conflict between Russia and some groups, e.g., Russia supports the Taliban and ISIS. They are trying to kill them in Syria. All this continues. None of this stops because of the Ukrainian situation. I am trying to look at this round from the Ukrainian side. From the Ukrainian side, we need anything to fight and to survive. When we speak about the bigger picture, all of us need to not only look at Europe; we need to look around. It is not only Europe or a Western crisis. It is a crisis of the whole world.

Jacobsen: What about these human rights violations with regards to joining the Russian army, e.g., Indians being duped - Indian nationals, citizens - into joining the Russian Federation army and then fighting for them? They leave with an injury or something. Now, Indian authorities, at least since early March, are in early talks with Russian officers to deal with these kinds of human rights abuses of Indian nationals tricked into fighting for the Russian army based on false promises.

Romantsova: Look, Xenophobia in the Russian Federation is enormous. I do not think someone from another nation can come to the Russian army and will be enough in contact to be part of the rest. It is not possible. First, most Russians do not know other languages except Russian and rude Russian.

Jacobsen: Rude Russian?

Romantsova: It is from Fifth Element. It is trendy here. That was a phrase from the hero, Bruce Willis. 'I know only two languages. Rude words and English.' [Ed. ""Whoa, lady, I only speak two languages, English and bad English.""] Every time, they mention some nationality, such as Makhachkala. Makhachkala, they come to the airport and go to the airfield and try to take back from the plane; families, Jewish families, who were from Israel or something like this, or some other place, because it is a Muslim region.

The same situation now, when Crocus City Hall was attacked, these were guys from Turkmenistan. It is a part of the old Soviet Union, a separate country with a broad autocratic regime. Now, these people come to Russia to have a primitive... Whenever Russians have an opportunity to show their xenophobia, they do that. I cannot imagine people with dark skin, with absolutely no English, not the same English where they expect to hear from people. That is not the precise pronunciation that will be respected in the Russian Federation. I cannot even imagine. So, they will be killed, not by Russians, but sent without ammunition or something. They send, send, send people without any support. So, I do not know.

Jacobsen: On March 9, Pope Francis stated that Ukraine and its allies should, more or less, wave the white flag. Given the size of the Catholic Church worldwide, this comes from a prominent world religious leader. How was that met last month, the comment from the Pope?

Romantsova: The Pope said something. Ukrainians and their population are usually used to that.

Jacobsen: It was criticized and met on deaf ears.

Romantsova: In Ukraine, we have 72 different kinds of churches, including Jewish, old Oriental forms of Christianity like the Copts or Armenian Christian Church, Muslim, Russian, and Buddhist temples. It includes different kinds of Christianity: Baptist churches and old Russian churches. So, Greek and Catholic, it is an organized community. It is focused mainly on the western part of Ukraine. They connect it with the Pope. They first hear what the Pope will say because Ukrainians believe in the Pope of their church. All other people think, ""One more politician who says something. What can you expect?"" Most people do not make much distinction between the Pope and the president. They know it is in Italy and a separate country, blah-blah-blah. It exists, and people who work for that. My organization's head needs to meet with the Pope in the following months. The Pope, traditionally, is a figure who can make negotiations. We will be continuing to speak with them because he is still essential. He can say something.

Jacobsen: Not too long ago, Ukrainian forces lost the city of Avdiivka after several months of very, very intense fighting. What has been the social and political impact within the context of the war?

Romantsova: It is so interesting. You say a few months. A few actions cover it. Now, you cannot get the views. All of the social impacts of what happened. First of all, many soldiers commented about Avdiivka. They take it back earlier than in Bakhmut, but it takes two weeks or something like that. That is the effect on the population and its attention now. Two weeks after that, we had another problem. I am sure the family who lost someone there or soldiers who were angry for their combat that way. They organized getting out of there and taking them out of there. For them, that was different news. For the rest of the population, ""We had a terrible day on the frontline. What can we do to have a good day on the frontline?""

Jacobsen: What were the remaining presidential comments about Estonia becoming the next NATO alliance leader? Does this have worse or better political implications vis-a-vis NATO for Ukrainian support?

Romantsova: It is essential. Does the commentator take us there or not? We have some rules. They do not include new countries with a planned conflict or something like that. Every time we hear about someone, we will feel only one comment. If it is expected, will it be possible for them to take Ukraine tomorrow or not? If a specialist discusses how this person can be helpful or not for Ukraine membership, that's all.

Jacobsen: How extensively are prisoners of war being tortured by Russian forces? There are reports of Ukrainian prisoners of war being tortured in Russia. Is there an extent of how far this is going, or is it just general knowledge that there is torture being done to Ukrainian prisoners of war?

Romantsova: It has happened to all prisoners over the last ten years. When we take people back from there, they give testimonies about it. That is not just a torture. The whole scope of imagined horrors, Hollywood horrors, over the last 40 years, they use it, including sexual and gender-based violence. It is a huge, huge, massive variety of tortures. We have testimonies of people who went through that by themselves.

Jacobsen: It is reported that one-third of Russian warships in the Black Sea have been destroyed or disabled. Is this a significant win for the Ukrainian side of the war, or are more substantial wins or points of import for the Ukrainian military and Ukrainians in general more to do with air superiority and artillery now? In other words, are the Navy's victories not the sort of victories they need?

Romantsova: I cannot specifically comment on the military. Yes, I have friends. Some of my friends are on the frontline. They are mainly at the ordinary level of the army. So, I need insights or a deep understanding of it. People suffered. All of the relatives suffered. People were killed on the frontline. They are fighting. We are still not Russia. They have had enough success. That is all that I know.

Jacobsen: What about other nations that do not have outstanding human rights records supporting the war effort of the Russian Federation? Not merely Iran with drones or North Korea with missiles but significant support from the Chinese government based on intelligence reports.

Romantsova: Most countries or nations are in the Middle East or Central Asia. We do not understand all of this region, as we do not have a profound traditional relationship with them. We speak about Central Asia. It is a former Soviet Union country. That is why we have a connection, but it is not deep. Ukraine has most of its information from intelligence services, whether in diplomacy or trading. You can buy some information from commercials. For example, we buy from Sputnik and put them in space. So, when we speak about what kind of information we need for fighting and whether China, Iran, or India have some technologies to give information for fighting, do they have some support for Russia or some support for Ukraine? It is carefully secured information, where our army takes information. The British intelligence service only wants guys who regularly command something on the frontlines between Ukraine and Russia. It could have happened in other sources. However, for Ukrainian sources, we have many sources from British intelligence services -- they publicly have some commanders. So, this war depends on intelligence, not simply intelligence, but the cyber information database. The war information is only taken from cyberspace. For example, where is a power plant in Ukraine? You can try to use an old map from the Soviet Union.

In the same way, you can break this power plant's system management, which connects with primary sources in cyberspace. Cyberspace information is what you need in this conflict. Many people are involved in cyberspace fighting and cyberwarfare around our Ukrainian-Russian war. China plays a large part in that. I do not know if they will ever speak about that publicly. I do not know if they publicly support Russia, but Chinese hackers participate. I know that.

Jacobsen: The recent attack on Israel by Iran; I am mixing this because Russia uses the drones used by Iran in the Russo-Ukrainian war. There was a significant response from the Israelis and Americans. Reports are that at least 99% of those missiles and drones launched were taken down before impact. So, is there a lesson to be learned from that, given the fact that much of the long-distance being done can be done to Ukraine, whether infrastructure, residential areas, or military targets have to do with missiles and drones?

Romantsova: First, we must understand that Israel is small. Second, I need to find out the rockets used by Iran to make this strike and launch them. As I understand it, it is an excellent example that the USA or other countries have such technology, which can help us. They cover some parts of Ukraine. They may need help to do that for an extensive territory like Ukraine. If we compare Israel and Ukraine, the size difference is significant. So, Israel will always be protected by the USA. It is true. However, we need many negotiations to have the same status to negotiate a lot.

Jacobsen: Do the primary areas for winning significant hunks against the Russian Federation involve cyber operations, cyber warfare and economic warfare? If we look at critical economic indicators within the Russian Federation, things like the society's size and growth rate in terms of people brought in through immigration or being born there. Russia has been declining for at least two decades or stagnating yearly. By 2050, the estimates are that they will lose ten million people in their total population numbers. So, it is a shrinking population, as with China in the last couple of years...

Romantsova: But you know, Russia has had a demographic crisis before. That is why I told you about xenophobia but at the same time. Russia needs labour from Central Asian countries because Central Asian countries mostly have language, former Soviet Union countries, but Baltic countries are members of the EU. Most know the Russian language but will never come to Russia to be simple workers or work simple jobs. They will go to the EU if they need money. It is the same with Belarus. I am not going to Russia, but to Poland, for example. As you understand now, Ukrainians are in the same situation as Moldova. Georgia and Armenia are location countries. Azerbaijan has more profit and income than Russia, so they are not going to Russia to have money through simple work or labour. Georgians and Armenians are small, two small countries.

All of them have a problem with Russia. So, only Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, all of those countries. Now, more and more, as big as Kazakhstan, they are much more speaking about anti-colonialism directions because they accept colonialism (former). The colonial politics of the Russian Federation, so only Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, etc., are countries with small populations. Now, no one likes them - the Russian Federation - because of Crocus City Center. That was the first season in these countries who returned to countries - these Central Asian countries - more than they left them. That means that the Russian Federation lost its labourers from Central Asia.

I think at the end of the year. They will lose even more. They are not like before, giving citizenship to the labourers in Central Asia. Most of them prefer to have citizenship of the Russian Federation, but they do not provide them. They like to use them like simple, cheap labourers, but not a part of politicians and the electorate. It is a difficult situation. Putin is trying to solve this through Ukrainian children. That is one of the reasons why they steal or kidnap them. It is the same if we speak about the Ukrainian population. One of my dreams of Putin is to join the territory of Ukraine tak, take all of this, repeal Ukrainians into the Russian population and solve the demographic crisis like this. However, one of the ways they are trying to control the matrimonial function of women. They are trying to put the women or motivate the women to have more children. One of the ideas is a bill in parliament that states that women can have higher education if they do not have two children.

Jacobsen: So, if they have higher education, they cannot.

Romantsova: It is just a bill. It is not a law now. They can, like all previous stupid bills, accept. It can be a backstep. Women in the Russian Federation, you must have two children before deciding to take higher education at university. It is against the classical, traditional Soviet Union idea that everyone should have higher education. Most of the populations of the former Soviet Union countries have higher education. In Ukraine, 80% of people have higher education. It is the usual and traditional period of your life. It does not mean you are choosing to go to university or not. You are going to university, or you - we call them - have a budget place where the State pays. Second, your parents collect the money and try to give it to you. For example, it is less expensive here in Ukraine than in the USA. It is traditional for most people here to have a higher education in some way. So, that is turning back from the evolution of the Soviet Union time.

Jacobsen: There are also statements about women having eight or more children or being urged to have eight or more children by Russian Federation leadership. At the same time, they are really pushing in the media and bills, not laws, so far, but also restricting the psychology of women's freedom through the repeal of physical protections for women. If a woman feels unsafe in the home, she will not feel safe to go out to do things freely: to get an education, to get a job, to have different and varied friends, and so on. Things like the repeal of the domestic violence protection law so that legally, you can, as a husband, beat your wife in Russia. That is a form of psychological warfare, too, not just a non-penalization of a negative behaviour. That sort of thing. It is along the lines of what you are saying as well. Only if you have children can you go and have children, where it is part, as you mentioned earlier, of what was a Soviet idea at the time of having higher education.

Romantsova: The Soviet idea was different at different times. It was 17 years. There was absolute equality between men and women initially, even in the understanding. They were trying to break the family's knowledge. It is not necessary to have a family to have some sexual relationship or to have children. However, after all the control of the State, they understood that having a family is much more comfortable for control. So, they started to speak, ""Yes, sure, women have equal rights here. In the Soviet Union, they are like men."" Society waiting, ""Yes, you have a job, but you have a 'second job.'"" At home, you take care of the children. Soviet women were with children. Women who care about the house and the deficit. It is a result of a centralized economy, a centralized planning economy. Women were mainly responsible for taking stock, finding, and buying things. Loads of people do not have the opportunity to use money, and those who do not use it. Women were responsible for home management, and they had work. They have a traditional need to have an education. All of this is built on a new glass ceiling for women. Some women are ministers in history or chiefs at big industrial companies. But mostly, you will not find these names in the history. That was not usual. That was not normal because women usually mainly cared about their families. So, education for women. That was a must-have. So, now, Russia wants to change. Russia changed the mental map of regular societal roles in the Russian Federation. They decriminalized home violence. They take back all the other areas of your life, except family, which you can control. You can't control your business, what kind of political media comes. You can't control whether you will have war or not. You can control one: Your family, if you are a man. If you are a woman, you need to find a man because all other ways to be protected will not help. So, inside the family, the man controls; it comes to a system of breeding families until the end of the 19th century when only men had a relationship with the State. Women always have any relationship with the State only through the man. Only your husband or your brother or father is responsible for your status. They determine your status. It is something like this. It is much easier to control men who only have power inside the family, so young control the family. So, the man controls the wife and children through this process. It is one of the ways they do this, as well as religion. They support spreading this Russian Orthodox ideology. But in this way, they are falling. They fall because statistics show fewer and fewer young people in the Russian Federation attend church. They may be believers but not members of the church.

Jacobsen: They are following in the line, ironically, of most of the Western world, which is a stark decline in attendance and belief in organized religion, particularly Christianity.

Romantsova: What happened with Russia is not a surprise, but a big problem for them; it is Islamization. In this situation, Islam gives more answers than Christianity.

Jacobsen: How so?

Romantsova: Islam talks about the Islamic State. Any state is foul. It needs to be corrected. It's because they need to recognize national or political management. In Muslim ideology, all the rights of believers are with one nation, Summa. All of these national countries or nations are false. It is temporary. We will all be in one Islamic world. So, it is one of the strong ideologies if you don't like a state. Putin created a state that is a system that can be unlikeable in one moment. If people do not have an average education, Islam proposes a sound system and understanding why Putin is wrong and all states are a bad idea. Allah did not create the states. So, that is all false. It is happening, first of all, in the jails. Before, in the Russian Federation, imagine 1 million people in prisons; it is a lot. Before, there were black and red jails; we call them zona. It is a secured zone, a jail. Black jails exist. The system of law calls them ""person who steals something.""

People who steal: Thieves. It was like a vast system of thieves during the Soviet era who created their law system. That's romanticized. This parallel reality exists in the jails. These are huge complexes that thieves control. They have their law, economic system, and all of this. It is not a mafia. It is a law. It is not one organization but a system of law. They call them ""thieves of the law."" Part of this reality was, again, the Soviet Union system. For example, Greek Catholic believers or a national movement against the Soviet Union. They are the same as Putin in jail. They start to be part of this system. It is fierce. They are criminals. They control part of these jails. Other parts of jails were controlled. During the Soviet Union, political cases and prisoners were put in red jails. Because police officers can prevent this, there are only two kinds of prisons now. Now, the third part of the jails is green, not black or red. Green means Islamic. This means that this is a closed society. It works by Islamic laws. It works through the law of crime. That is new. Before, it did not exist at all in the territory of former Soviet countries.

Jacobsen: It is points at interviews like this where I enjoy them because I have covered such a broad range of subject matter in a little over a decade.

Romantsova: [Laughing].

Jacobsen: Because I put in a lot of time. I have interviewed a lot of members of the ex-Muslim community. There is a whole host of them. A lot of the online secular community, especially, is one place in which they can formally organize, communicate, share arguments, share stories, help others who are getting out of more cases and help them leave religion when religion has taken an extreme form. Not as extreme as Salafi Wahhabi interpretations from Saudi Arabia, but certainly, family and community and national contexts where it is dangerous for them. So, you're talking about the thing in which they find many problems. Not they disagree with you; they agree with you because they see a threat of politicized religion in the way that a lot of people would see politicized Christianity as an issue in North America or in Russia, particularly in the United States and particularly in the Russian Federation. In the context of the Russian Federation, do you think that the xenophobia that you mentioned at the start has some ties to Islamist tendencies in the Russian Federation and concerns of politicized religion, providing some challenge to the leadership in the country? Is this enough of a challenge in the Russian Federation or more of a substantial nuisance to the leadership?

Romantsova: If Russia exists in Chechnya and a few other regions and a few more are more Islamic, Chechnya is more important because Kadyrov showed that the Islamic region in the Russian Federation could be in power. We do not know why. I think we know why, but Putin absolutely did not react as if there was any problem with Kadyrov, Chechnya's leader. It is not police, but special forces. He and his troops terroristically controlled Chechnya. They showed Russia that you can be absolutely Islamic and officially accepted. It is the same situation as the Taliban from Afghanistan. Putin officially meets with them. I think Putin showed that if you organize like an Islamic movement. You can even be strong enough that Putin accepts you as part of the dialogue.

For the first time since 2003, an extreme geomagnetic storm - the most severe of its kind - hit Earth on Friday evening. Beautiful green, purple and red dancing aurora displays, also known as the northern lights, were spotted across Europe and very low latitudes in the United States, as far south as Alabama and Florida.

If you missed Friday's show, more geomagnetic activity is expected to continue on Saturday and potentially Sunday. As of Saturday morning, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast called for another strong geomagnetic storm, although slightly weaker than Friday's show. The aurora could be visible as far south as Illinois and Oregon with the naked eye, but could be seen farther south with a camera.

""I started shooting at the end of blue hour and could see some hints of aurora on the camera screen (some purple). Then it just went crazy!"" photographer Gwenael Blanck, in central France, wrote on spaceweather.com Friday. ""The entire sky was pink on the northern horizon. The colour and structure were visible to the naked eye. Utterly crazy!!! And it was only the beginning!""

NOAA scientists also warned of potential disruptions in satellite and radio communications, as well as to the electricity grid.

On Saturday morning, NOAA said in a statement that there were ""reports of power grid irregularities and degradation to high-frequency communications and GPS."" Starlink, the satellite internet company, said it was ""experiencing degraded service"" on Saturday morning. A team is investigating the cause, but the satellites have been affected in the past by geomagnetic storms.

Geomagnetic storms are created when a surge of particles and plasma from the sun temporarily jostle Earth's magnetosphere, sometimes resulting in the northern lights or technology disruptions. NOAA categorizes geomagnetic storms on a scale of G1 to G5, with G5 the most severe.

The agency anticipated a severe G4 storm, but the activity exceeded forecasts on Friday. Around 7 p.m. Eastern time, the storm reached the G5 level. The last time a storm of this severity hit Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged transformers in South Africa.

The storm continued for several hours at varying strengths through Saturday morning, when it again hit a G5 level. NOAA calls for a strong (G3) level through Saturday, although the forecast may be updated as more solar activity arrives at Earth.

Forecasts anticipated the severe storm would bring aurora displays unusually far south in the Northern Hemisphere. The northern lights filled skies in France, Spain, Italy, Austria, southern Switzerland, London and India. In the United States, people reported sightings along Virginia's Blue Ridge Parkway, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, New Mexico, Mississippi, Florida and Texas.

Residents in northern and central Mexico also flooded social media with photos of the swirling pink night sky there late Friday.

In the Southern Hemisphere, aurora were photographed in Chile, Argentina and New Zealand, where they are known as aurora australis or the southern lights.

The intense geomagnetic activity is the result of several eruptions from the sun's surface, known as coronal mass ejections. At least six erupted from the sun earlier in the week, sending a punch of solar particles and the sun's magnetic field toward Earth.

Some of the solar particles travel along our planet's magnetic field lines into the upper atmosphere, exciting nitrogen and oxygen molecules, and releasing photons of light in different colors - or the aurora. At lower latitudes, red auroras are more common because red occurs at higher altitudes and can be seen farther away from the poles.

The series of eruptions came from a very large and complex cluster of dark blotches on the sun, called sunspots, where the sun's magnetic field is very strong and solar eruptions can occur. This sunspot group is about 17 times the diameter of Earth.

During Friday's storm, the sunspot cluster continued to be active. It launched a very large and intense burst of radiation, known as a solar flare. Oftentimes, coronal mass ejections accompany solar flares and have the potential to increase geomagnetic activity on Earth - so stay tuned.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" Björn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, Päivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing a mini-renaissance in Sweden, which would echo similar trends seen in other heavily cashless economies. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfectly legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with these trends through a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"" on April 2. According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. Even the European Central Bank has called for a regulatory crackdown on all businesses and public bodies in the Euro Area that refuse to accept cash. At the same time, the ECB is proceeding in its digital euro project from the ""investigation phase"" to the ""preparation phase.""

As I noted at the time, cash is still the most frequently used payment method in the Euro Area, though it is losing ground to cards. Even if, or when, the digital euro is launched, it will presumably coexist with cash for some time, at least until the digital euro gains a strong enough foothold. ECB President Lagarde has said that ""cash is here to stay,"" adding that European citizens ""will have both options: cash and digital cash."" How long it stays that way will remain to be seen. My guess is that if the digital euro does gain a strong foothold, the ECB will begin financially incentivising its use while decentivising the use of cash.

In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback of sorts after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to be seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers to reduce its use is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert Häring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash."" Since early 2016 Sweden's central bank has slowed the march towards a cashless society, as Häring reported at the time.

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash?

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" Björn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, Päivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing a mini-renaissance in Sweden, which would echo similar trends seen in other heavily cashless economies. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfectly legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with these trends through a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"" on April 2. According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. Even the European Central Bank has called for a regulatory crackdown on all businesses and public bodies in the Euro Area that refuse to accept cash. At the same time, the ECB is proceeding in its digital euro project from the ""investigation phase"" to the ""preparation phase.""

As I noted at the time, cash is still the most frequently used payment method in the Euro Area, though it is losing ground to cards. Even if, or when, the digital euro is launched, it will presumably coexist with cash for some time, at least until the digital euro gains a strong enough foothold. ECB President Lagarde has said that ""cash is here to stay,"" adding that European citizens ""will have both options: cash and digital cash."" How long it stays that way will remain to be seen. My guess is that if the digital euro does gain a strong foothold, the ECB will begin financially incentivising its use while decentivising the use of cash.

In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback of sorts after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to be seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers to reduce its use is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert Häring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash.""

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash? That will have to be the subject of a future article, though readers' suggestions are more than welcome in the meantime.",zerohedge.com,news,Zero Hedge,,0.2,453115917,3,https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/cashless.JPG?itok=9Wsbr2Y5,

Israel has imposed a complete siege on the densely populated territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.

Anger and frustration with the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza have sparked university protests across the world.

""Tensions are boiling over on university campuses across the US as student protests in support of Palestinians continue to grow, and are increasingly met with police violence despite students and faculty insisting the demonstrations have been peaceful,""

the Guardian reported.

Many universities have called police and other law enforcement agencies onto campus. In the United States alone, more than 2,000 students have been arrested.

Both protests and the campus crackdowns have also spread to other parts of the world - from Canada to Australia, and in multiple European nations. On Monday, students at Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom also set up encampments.

Al Jazeera has reported that students at over 100 universities are protesting across the US. Their counterparts in at least 20 campuses outside of the US are protesting and several of these protests are also encampments.

Students at Harvard, and Brown have joined in pro-Palestinian protests across college campuses. They want their schools to stop accepting funding from groups that directly or indirectly fund the war in Gaza, NBC Boston has reported.

Protesters are demanding that their schools sever any direct or indirect financial and academic links with Israel.

At Berlin's Freie Universität in Germany on Tuesday, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters occupied a courtyard.

The protesters set up tents and formed a human chain, chanting slogans such as ""Viva, Viva Palestina"".

Student protests demanding that universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war have spread across Europe, sparking clashes and arrests as new demonstrations broke out in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Austria, the Guardian reported.

In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France, and Britain following earlier protests in the US, Euronews reported.

Dublin's Trinity College students in Ireland and Lausanne University in Switzerland have joined US universities in solidarity with the encampments protesting against the Israeli war on Gaza.

On May 7, Dutch police violently broke up a pro-Palestinian demonstration camp at the University of Amsterdam, arresting 125 students.

Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's assault on Gaza.

According to CNN, pro-Palestinian encampments have been set up at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England, as students there call on leadership to sever ties to Israel.

The Western media coverage tries to frame the pro-Palestine protesters in Western universities as violent and racist, a social activist from Canada, told Mehr News Agency.

""I think camera phones and social media make the truth much harder to hide,"" Tyler Berglund added.

Dr. Jody Armour, a distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, told The Tehran Times, ""We spend a lot of time teaching these students to think freely and independently, and then we crack down on them when they put our teachings into practice.""

Iran's Deputy Minister of Science, Research, and Technology Hashem Dadashpour has voiced Iran's readiness to offer scholarships to American students who have been expelled due to protesting the crimes of the Zionist regime in Gaza.

The event included a rich program of panel sessions, discussions, business breakfasts and round tables where the most important aspects of economic development were discussed. The central topic was the role of the government, investors and entrepreneurs in supporting small and medium-sized businesses.

At the session devoted to anti-corruption, experts emphasized that the effective fight against corruption and crime in the economy is a key factor for improving the investment climate. They noted that creating a safe and transparent business environment plays an important role in this process.

""A successful fight against corruption requires a comprehensive approach that includes strengthening legislation and increasing transparency of government actions,"" said Akmal Burkhanov, director of the Agency for Countering Corruption of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

The session devoted to retail trade outlined the main challenges and opportunities for the industry. The participants expressed their opinion on the need to improve tax legislation and simplify import procedures. They also noted that it is important to create conditions for successful adaptation of new brands on the market.

""Thanks to the decree on the reduction of customs duties, we managed to set fair prices like in the UK and Kazakhstan,"" shared Ilya Lyapustin, Sales and Marketing Director of Tashkent City Mall.

The business breakfast dedicated to women's entrepreneurship emphasized the significant impact of businesswomen on society. Speakers presented inspiring examples and strategies for striking a balance between profitability and social responsibility.

The focus was on attracting foreign investment through residence permit programs.

""Over the past few years, Uzbekistan has established itself as an attractive destination for global investors due to its openness to cooperation and prospects in the real estate sector,"" said Akram Mukhamatkulov of Henley&Partners.

The roundtable ""Supply Chains and Sustainability: finding a balance in the face of uncertainty"" discussed the challenges and strategies to ensure the sustainability of global supply chains.

""Turkey and Uzbekistan have a strategic partnership, and we can significantly strengthen cooperation by working together,"" said Turkish Deputy Trade Minister Sezay Ucarmak.

The experts also emphasized the importance of integrating digital technologies into investment strategies. They noted that digitalization is not the future, but already today, and plays a key role in accelerating investment processes and increasing transparency.

At the pitch session ""IT-PARK Uzbekistan: New Development Prospects"", plans to turn Uzbekistan into a regional center of information technologies by 2030 were presented.

Sherzod Shermatov, Minister of Digital Technologies of Uzbekistan, spoke about the significance of recent investments. ""Yesterday we witnessed an important event - the start of construction of the $5 billion Data Volt green data center, which is a major foreign direct investment project. We are creating a favorable environment for IT companies and launching a Zero Risk program to cover all risks associated with opening and running offices in Uzbekistan,"" he said.

At the round table ""Connections: Revival of the Great Silk Road"", international experts and representatives of state bodies explored opportunities to expand ties, economic cooperation and cultural exchange along the ancient routes of the Silk Road.

At the roundtable ""Integrated Urban Planning: Quality Investments, Comfort for Environment and People"", leading urbanists, architects and representatives of the business community discussed approaches to the development of the city of Tashkent. In particular, BCG Managing Director and Senior Partner Vladislav Butenko emphasized the importance of integrating innovative solutions into urban planning to achieve sustainable urban development. He emphasized that both economic and social aspects should be taken into account in integrated planning, ensuring a balance between them.

The Forum has played an important role in attracting investments for various ministries and regions of Uzbekistan. The agreements signed demonstrate the development of key sectors such as industry, energy, pharmaceuticals and automobile manufacturing.

One of the main achievements of the forum was the agreement between the Ministry of Digital Technologies, the Ministry of Energy and IT company Data Volt on the construction of a data center based on ""green"" technologies. Experts noted the importance of such projects for Uzbekistan. Minister of Investment, Industry and Trade Laziz Kudratov and Data Volt director Rajit Nanda took part in the signing ceremony.

The III International Investment Forum in Tashkent has come to an end, but the planned initiatives and signed agreements promise active work on attracting investments and ensuring sustainable development. Uzbekistan has reaffirmed its role as a strategic partner in the international arena, attracting the attention of global investors and contributing to the economic growth of the region.

THE City of Harare will fork out almost US$9,5 million in annual garbage collection fees if an exclusive deal still under discussion with Geo Pomona Waste Management Private Limited is consummated, the Zimbabwe Independent was told this week.

In an exclusive interview, Geo Pomona Waste Management Pvt Ltd CEO and executive chairperson Dilesh Nguwaya said according to the terms of the transaction, which were exclusively reported by the Independent last week, his firm will be collecting 650 tonnes of waste at a cost of US$40 per tonne daily.

Geo Pomona Waste Management's plan is to get rid of waste, which has been blamed for deadly epidemic outbreaks, like cholera and typhoid, in Harare in the past few years.

The waste will be used for electricity generation for the national grid, according to Nguwaya.

""The City of Harare committed to deliver a minimum of 650 tonnes per day at US$40 per tonne,"" Nguwaya said this week.

""They have been found wanting in respect of waste collection and delivery. This is the basis of the proposal we are currently discussing,"" he added.

Nguwaya explained that the charges set out and agreed to by the City of Harare in the Joint Venture Concession Agreement were ""fairly cheaper"" than those charged in Europe.

""You will be aware that the standards at Pomona are in line with modern European trends in waste management. Below, we put the figures charged per tonne; Austria (US$166), Belgium (US$112), Denmark (US$114), Finland (US$116), France (US$95), Ireland (US$154), Italy (US$127), and the United Kingdom (US$135),"" he said.

Harare mayor Jacob Mafume and top council officials were recently summoned to the Ministry of Local Government and told to relinquish refuse collection to Geo Pomona from next month.

The negotiations come two years after the government handed over managing rights of the capital's main dumpsite in Pomona, Harare, for 30 years to Netherlands-based Geogenix BV fronted by Nguwaya.

The transaction between Geoginx BV, which runs Geo Pomona, and government, has over the years triggered a fierce tussle between government and the City of Harare.

Calculations by the Independent showed that the 650 tonnes of daily waste translate to US$26 000 per day, and US$9,49 million annually.

These are some of the terms of the US$310 million investment deal Geo Pomona agreed with City of Harare in 2019 to transform the Pomona dumpsite.

Between 16 megawatts (MW) and 20MW will be generated and fed into the national grid from the waste-to-energy plant.

Nguwaya said discussions with the City of Harare, which has been struggling to collect waste in the capital, were still underway.

With garbage being a core raw material required to set up the power generation plant, Nguwaya added that Geo Pomona Waste Management would require 1 000 tonnes of waste to generate electricity.

Several other companies have also commenced small scale power generation at their operations for internal consumption, with surplus being directed to the national grid.

Last week, Gloria Magombo, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Power Development, said small scale power projects like these would be vital to help Zimbabwe deal with power deficits.

Power generation has mainly been affected by droughts, especially at the hydro power station in Kariba. Zimbabwe requires an estimated 4 000MW to power its industries and for domestic use per day.

However, as a result of limited generating capacity, the southern African country bridges its deficit through imports.

""We plan to incinerate 1 000 tonnes per day of solid municipal waste to produce 16MW to 22MW of electricity, which will be fed to the national grid for the benefit of the country,"" Nguwaya said.

""This is a sustainable way of managing waste and reducing the waste that goes to landfills. Previously, the (Pomona) site lacked proper access due to overflowing waste.""

The investment project has triggered fears that City of Harare workers under its public works department may lose jobs when Geo Pomona Waste Management starts to collect garbage.

However, Nguwaya allayed those fears, indicating that the scope of the project entailed retaining jobs.

""These are some of the issues that are under discussion. We do not believe in exclusionary business practices. The plan is to employ the City of Harare workers, who might be directly affected,"" Nguwaya explained.

The decision to pave the way for Geo Pomana Waste Management to start collecting garbage was based on the failure by Harare to effectively collect waste in most parts of the capital, forcing some residents to engage private garbage collectors at monthly costs of around US$90 per household.

In Harare, areas like the central business district suffer from chronic litter and neglect, with piles of refuse accumulating unchecked for extended periods.

Apart from Harare, other local authorities in Zimbabwe have been battling to come up with a lasting solution to address the eyesore problem of garbage.",theindependent.co.zw,news,The Zimbabwe Independent,Tinashe Kairiza,-0.2313725490196078,453046003,5,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/theindependent/uploads/2024/05/5WSC5emLTfgoEUgpTjLAvagSQiKWWKT4wPLbnUUQ.jpg,

The EU's objectives are ambitious: The total solar energy deployment is to reach around 750 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. In this context, dual land use concepts, especially agricultural PV, are gaining importance. According to a study by the German Energy Agency dena, thanks to funding programs and dedicated legislations, agricultural PV is facing a massive market ramp-up in Europe. At the same time, the applied research into agricultural PV is coming along in leaps and bounds, and the number of projects is rising. At Intersolar Europe, the world's leading exhibition for the solar industry, visitors will have the opportunity to see a varied range of technologies, products and solutions, and to gain deeper insights into best practices and the latest developments. Intersolar Europe will take place from June 19-21, 2024 as part of The smarter E Europe, the continent's largest alliance of exhibitions for the energy industry, in Munich. The event will be flanked by the three exhibitions ees Europe, Power2Drive Europe and EM-Power Europe.

Agriculture or renewable sources of energy - in the past, it was either, or. Agricultural PV is a new, innovative approach offering promising options for agriculture and climate protection by joining agricultural production and the generation of electricity on the same surface. Thanks to agricultural PV, photovoltaics and photosynthesis are no longer in competition, but complementing each other.

European countries such as Germany and France subsidize agricultural PV with the aim of deploying more solar energy while reducing the competition for land use. Germany has introduced a separate auction segment with a top value for ""special solar installation"" (which includes agricultural PV installations) in the Solar Package 1, and France is deemed one of the pioneers for dedicated legislation. Other countries, such as Austria and the Netherlands, also promote their agricultural PV sector. Despite all of this progress, there is no all-European legislation, and that makes matters cumbersome for international investors and project developers.

To exploit agricultural PV's full potential, harmonized legislation will be indispensable in the medium term. The advantages of dual land use are obvious: It reconciles solar energy with agriculture, and the protection against storm, hale, frost and draught adds an extra bonus for farmers. The electricity production costs are lower than from small roof-mounted installations, and farmers' income is diversified. Shading and wind protection provided by solar panels reduces evaporation, and innovative solar panels have been developed that also collect rainwater for irrigation. This can benefit farming operations by boosting their resilience against crop failure.

The applications of agricultural PV range across many different agricultural uses, including horticulture, viniculture, arable land and even pastures. The potential of agricultural PV is particularly obvious in horticulture and viniculture, where it can increase the yield of certain plants. In southern Europe in particular, where climate change is palpable, berries, grapes and olives can benefit from the technology. Fruit and fruit vegetables can still produce the same yields even if there is some minor shading from solar panels. A study by Iliotec and Fraunhofer ISE has identified new options for many arable crops, such as rapeseed, celery, onions and cabbage. When it comes to plants that are particularly sensitive to shading, it is important to pay attention to the width of plant rows. On pastures, agricultural PV modules can protect animals against wind and precipitation, improving their wellbeing.

Pilot projects are emerging all over Europe. In the Dutch local authority of Meierijstad, for example, BayWa r.e. AG and their subsidiary GroenLeven are implementing a pioneering agricultural PV project, a 8.7 megawatt peak solar installation covering a vast raspberry plantation. On Sicily, figs and olives grow between the module rows of Europe's largest agricultural PV plant, which has a capacity of 135 megawatts (MW). In Neißeaue, Germany, Next2Sun Technology GmbH works on a 20 MW solar farm with vertical modules, while Vattenfall are constructing a major agricultural PV project with 79 MW and a single-axis tracking system on 93 hectares of a free-range organic egg farm in Tützplatz, Germany.

Intersolar Europe, the world's leading exhibition for the solar industry is putting a particular focus on agricultural PV in 2024. A special exhibit in the Outdoor Area will be dedicated to the topic. Partners of the special exhibit are BayWa AG, BayWa r.e., Conexio PSE, Vista Geo and ZIMMERMANN PV-Steel Group. Among other things, the companies will be presenting tracking systems for agricultural PV applications. What's more, of the more than 1,370 Intersolar Europe exhibitors, some 60 exhibitors will be showcasing agricultural PV products and solutions. Experts will dive deeper into the topic and offer even wider information at a number of sessions at the Intersolar Forum and the Intersolar Europe Conference.

Will Other Central Banks Listen? | naked capitalism,"At a time when the dominant narrative around cash is that its demise is all but inevitable, as well as broadly desirable, the 2024 payment report by Sweden's Riksbank may offer a cautionary tale.

In October last year, in More Good News for Cash in Europe, More Bad News for Digital Dollar in US, we reported that recent developments suggest that the trend away from cash and toward purely digital-only payment systems may not be quite as smooth or as seamless as some may have wished or expected. One of the developments we highlighted in that report was growing concern among central bankers and politicians in Sweden, one of Europe's most cashless economies, about the unintended consequences of driving cash out of the economy:

Even by late 2020, Sweden had less cash in circulation than just about anywhere else in the world, at around 1% of gross domestic product, according to the latest available data. That compares with 8% in the U.S. and more than 10% in the euro area. As a recent piece in Interesting Engineering notes, Sweden is already ""officially cashless"":

Cash is never needed, not even for small purchases like hot chocolate at a Christmas market in Stockholm. All vendors have a mobile payment chip-and-PIN card reader like the one offered by Stockholm-based mobile payments company iZettle, or they accept payments through the mobile application Swish. Swishing is perhaps the easiest way of payment for everyone.

The Risks of Going Fully Cashless

But now the country is beginning to realise that an almost exclusively digital payments system comes with significant risks, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. In time-honoured fashion, the article in the UK Telegraph began with a spot of fearmongering about Vladimir Putin.

""People started to realise that it is very easy for Vladimir Putin to switch everything off,"" Björn Eriksson, a retired police chief, former head of Interpol and leading cash advocate, told the Telegraph. ""At first we were arguing for vulnerable people, the elderly, women in abusive relationships who rely on cash... Now we are talking about national security. And it's not only Putin, it could also be organised crime.""

In 2021, the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank (and the world's oldest), introduced a new directive obliging the country's six largest credit institutions to continue providing their customers with certain basic cash services.

But while that may have meant that people in Sweden can continue to access cash from their local branch, it is becoming increasingly difficult to use it as fewer and fewer retail businesses accept notes and coins.

This is partly due to the greater convenience of handling digital payments while the card processing fees are substantially lower than the US. But it is also because most Swedes, including many pensioners, prefer to use cards or mobile payments. As a baker in Stockholm told the Telegraph, ""the only people who bring cash to the shop are tourists. I feel bad for them because they just take the krona home, where it is useless.""

But even that trend may be reversing. According to Eriksson, a growing number of young people are joining the pro-cash movement -- and mainly over privacy concerns.

Rediscovering the Benefits of Cash

Earlier this week, Heise Online, a German online news service that covers IT, telecommunications, and technology sectors, published a long, in-depth report about the Riksbank's apparent rediscovery of some of the benefits of cash. The article also explores some of the Riksbank's concerns about the potential fragility of a fully cashless payment system, as outlined in its 2024 Payments Report, published in March.

At a time when the dominant narrative around cash -- as espoused by senior bankers, central bankers, big tech and fintech executives, politicians and economists, and of course, their ever-faithful servants in the media -- is that its demise is all but inevitable, even in countries where cash is still King (Germany, Spain, Austria, Mexico, Thailand, Japan...), the Riksbank's report may offer a cautionary tale. From the Heise Online piece (machine translated):

""The Swedish payments market has been digitized rapidly,"" states the Riksbank. Cash and manual payment services have been replaced by cards, mobile phones and internet services. ""As a result, payments have become faster, smoother and cheaper overall,"" which the institute points out is ""a positive development."" However, there are groups in society ""who do not have access to digital payment services or find it difficult to use them and are therefore marginalized"". There are also ""serious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.""

Digitalization also makes payments ""more vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,"" the bank points out. At the same time, the geopolitical developments of the past few years required ""Sweden to have strong civil defense."" The developments suggested ""that we should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.""

Put another way, cash does not crash. It does not fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (though, of course, ATMs might). By contrast, digital payment systems need a stable and continuous internet connection to process transactions. When these connections fail, the result is often chaos. Digital payment outages have caused significant disruption in a host of countries in recent years, including the US, the UK, Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Canada, Spain and Norway. Generally speaking, the more cashless the country, the greater the disruption.

Sweden's Cashless Journey

Sweden is one of the world's most cashless economies. In large part, its abandonment of cash was the result of technological and generational shifts. As payment technologies began to change in the first two decades of this century, most Swedish citizens began to prefer the speed, ease and convenience of digital payments.

They were also nudged heavily in that direction by commercial banks, which by 2016 had made 60% of their branches cashless, as a 2019 Riksbank working paper documents. This made it much more difficult for citizens to access cash and for businesses to deposit it, which in turn accelerated the uptake of digital payments and the abandonment.

Sweden's legal tender laws also made it possible for the Riksbank to withdraw many of Sweden's large denomination notes in circulation. For instance, the value of 1,000-krona notes (worth just over $90) in circulation declined gradually from SEK 48.4 billion in 2001 to SEK 21.4 billion in December 2012. Beginning in 2013, this decline accelerated, plunging to SEK 9.7 billion by December 2013.

After playing a part in the wholesale removal of cash from Sweden's economy, the Riksbank is now trying to reverse some of the damage it has caused. It is not the only Scandinavian central bank to have flagged up the fragility risks of exclusively digital payment systems. In 2022, the Bank of Finland recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. Like all Nordic countries, Finland is a largely cash-free economy. But like Sweden, it has begun to see the risks of going too far, too soon.

In March 2022, the central bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. In October of that year, the Head of the Payment Systems Department and Chief Cashier at the Bank of Finland, Päivi Heikkinen, even advised households to make sure they have some cash on hand, just in case the country's payments system were to go down. At the time, Finland had just applied to become a NATO member and the government was fretting about the risk of cyber attacks from Russia. In an interview with the national broadcaster, Heikkinen said her intention was not to ""fabricate catastrophic scenarios"" -- before saying that in the worst case scenario, the payments system could go down for a period of weeks.

In Sweden, the Riksbank is already taking countermeasures to try to guarantee a steady supply of cash, the Heise Online article notes:

It is improving the cash supply by setting up new offices where companies can collect and deposit cash. Having such cash depots in more locations across the country would reduce both the costs for businesses and the risk that cash would no longer be usable in the event of a disruption.

This is the only way to ensure ""that everyone can pay"". In general, ""stronger legal protection for cash"" is necessary. Banks should be required to ""accept cash deposits, including coins, from individuals.""

The Riksbank supports its demands with reference to an annual representative survey on the payment habits of Swedes. According to this, ""cash is being used more frequently than before"". Almost half of respondents reported using cash in the past month, an increase of 15 percentage points compared to 2022.

This pro-active approach to bolstering the cash system contrasts sharply with what some central banks and governments are saying and doing in other Western or Western-adjacent countries. As we reported in August, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies is mulling a number of legislative proposals calling for an end to the printing, minting and circulation of physical notes and coins. As the World Economic Forum trumpeted in 2022, Brazilians are adopting digital payments faster than anyone else.

In Australia, the government refuses to legally protect the use of cash in retail settings. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Michele Bullock, has even warned that as the running costs of processing cash for banks and businesses mount as a result of the declining share of consumer payments made using cash, it may become necessary to begin charging people for using cash in retail settings.

Granted, Australia is significantly larger and more sparsely populated than Sweden, making it much harder and more costly to transport money securely to all parts of the country, including remote parts of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. But whereas the Riksbank is talking about taking on a proactive role, together with other authorities and banks, to ensure that cash can be transported to and from retail outlets at reasonable prices, the RBA is talking about making consumers pay for the privilege of using cash. Meanwhile, Armaguard, Australia's largest currency transport business, servicing around 90% of the cash-in-transit market, is warning of bankruptcy -- unless the banks agree to pay more for its services.

Predictably, Bullock's suggestion that citizens may one day have to fork over extra fees for the privilege of paying with cash -- to protect the banks and retailers from the exorbitant costs of maintaining cash infrastructure -- did not go down well with many Australians. While most citizens are using digital payments for most, if not all, of their purchases, millions still depend on cash in their daily lives.

What's more, the very same Big Four banks Bullock wants to protect from having to part with extra money to fortify Australia's cash network have posted record or near-record profits in recent times, in part because of surging interest rates but also because of the rising fees they charge on card payments. Those same banks received huge sums of cheap debt to tide them over during the COVID-19 pandemic while at the same time closing hundreds of branches and ATMs across the country.

In Sweden, as Heisse Online notes, more and more Swedes see the decline in cash consumption as a negative development -- 44 percent in 2023 compared to 36 percent in the previous year:

The proportion of respondents who believe that they cannot get by without cash in today's society has also increased compared to 2022. This could also be ""an effect of increased crisis awareness due to the war in Ukraine,"" the bankers speculate.

The need to pay in cash in certain situations such as at clubs, in corner shops and at flea markets is also mentioned, the report goes on to say. Some also emphasized that using cash made it easier for them to keep track of their finances. Older people generally find it much more difficult to get by without cash than younger people. In the 2023 survey, half of respondents said they wanted to pay cash but the store did not accept it. In 2022 the corresponding value was only 37 percent...

These numbers suggest that cash may be experiencing something of a renaissance among key segments of Sweden's populations, which echoes similar trends seen elsewhere. For example, a recent survey down under by fintech company Waave revealed that as many as 71% of Australians are worried about the economy becoming completely cashless. Those most concerned include Baby Boomers (82%), regional Australians (77%), and lower income households earning less than $100k (75%) -- a reminder of the oft-ignored class-war element of the War on Cash.

It's not hard to see why concerns about the future of cash are on the rise down under. In recent months, three of Australia's Big Four banks have removed over-the-counter cash withdrawals from some of their branches while increasing numbers of businesses, both large and small, are choosing to reject cash payments altogether. In Australia, it is perfect legal for businesses to refuse to accept cash as long as they inform consumers of their stance before any ""contract"" for the supply of goods or services is entered into.

Aussie cash lovers recently expressed their displeasure with a ""Draw Out Some Cash Day"". According to news.com.au, hoards of people were seen lining up to withdraw cash on April 2:

The movement, led by the Cash is King Facebook group, aimed to show banks and retailers there is still a demand for cash amid warnings the country will be ""functionally cashless"" by 2025.

Social media posts show ""massive queues"" of people, both young and old, lining up at various banks around the country, with one woman sharing she waited for up to an hour to get her hands on bank notes.

""All banks I passed today had queues out the door,"" one person wrote on Facebook alongside a picture of people lining up outside a Commonwealth Bank branch.

Governments in other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Slovakia and Austria, are taking pro-active steps to protect the use of cash. In the UK, meanwhile, cash may even be staging a comeback after ten consecutive years of falling use. According to both UK Finance, the country's largest bank association, and the British Retail Consortium Group, the most influential retail lobbying group, cash use increased in 2022, for the first time in a decade. Whether this rebound represents a genuine trend reversal or merely a dead cat bounce (apologies, as always, to feline lovers) remains to seen. But the mere fact that cash use is growing at all despite concerted efforts by the government, banks and retailers is noteworthy.

So, too, is the fact that Sweden's Riksbank is expressing reservations about the resilience of a fully cashless society. After all, the Riksbank was one of the first central banks in Europe to begin aggressively undermining the role of cash in the economy. That said, its U-turn on cash it is not as novel a development as is suggested by the Heise Online article. The Riksbank, the article claims in its introduction, ""is suddenly emphasising the indispensable role of cash in secure, widely available payment systems. This is a change in strategy.""

That is somewhat misleading. As the German financial journalist Norbert Häring notes (in German) on his blog, while there has definitely been a sea change in strategy at the Riksbank, that change did not begin just now but rather eight years ago, ""after the central bank, together with Sweden's commercial banks, had done everything they could to undermine the use of cash."" Since early 2016 Sweden's central bank has slowed the march towards a cashless society, as Häring reported at the time.

Now, the Riksbank is not just questioning the wisdom of moving to a fully cashless economy at this current moment in time; it is explicitly warning about the potential risks such a move might entail. At the same time, it is working on developing a CBDC -- the so-called e-krona, now in its fourth and final pilot phase, looking at ""how an e-Krona can be used offline for payments if electricity and telecommunications are not working."" Which begs the question: once the e-krona is ready to launch, which will presumably be sooner than most other CBDCs in the West, how will it co-exist with cash? That will have to be the subject of a future article.",nakedcapitalism.com,news,naked capitalism,Nick Corbishley,0.2,453034155,3,,

THE City of Harare will fork out almost US$9,5 million in annual garbage collection fees if an exclusive deal still under discussion with Geo Pomona Waste Management Private Limited is consummated, the Zimbabwe Independent was told this week.

In an exclusive interview, Geo Pomona Waste Management Pvt Ltd CEO and executive chairperson Dilesh Nguwaya said according to the terms of the transaction, which were exclusively reported by the Independent last week, his firm will be collecting 650 tonnes of waste at a cost of US$40 per tonne daily.

Geo Pomona Waste Management's plan is to get rid of waste, which has been blamed for deadly epidemic outbreaks, like cholera and typhoid, in Harare in the past few years.

The waste will be used for electricity generation for the national grid, according to Nguwaya.

""The City of Harare committed to deliver a minimum of 650 tonnes per day at US$40 per tonne,"" Nguwaya said this week.

""They have been found wanting in respect of waste collection and delivery. This is the basis of the proposal we are currently discussing,"" he added.

Nguwaya explained that the charges set out and agreed to by the City of Harare in the Joint Venture Concession Agreement were ""fairly cheaper"" than those charged in Europe.

""You will be aware that the standards at Pomona are in line with modern European trends in waste management. Below, we put the figures charged per tonne; Austria (US$166), Belgium (US$112), Denmark (US$114), Finland (US$116), France (US$95), Ireland (US$154), Italy (US$127), and the United Kingdom (US$135),"" he said.

Harare mayor Jacob Mafume and top council officials were recently summoned to the Ministry of Local Government and told to relinquish refuse collection to Geo Pomona from next month.

The negotiations come two years after the government handed over managing rights of the capital's main dumpsite in Pomona, Harare, for 30 years to Netherlands-based Geogenix BV fronted by Nguwaya.

The transaction between Geoginx BV, which runs Geo Pomona, and government, has over the years triggered a fierce tussle between government and the City of Harare.

Calculations by the Independent showed that the 650 tonnes of daily waste translate to US$26 000 per day, and US$9,49 million annually.

These are some of the terms of the US$310 million investment deal Geo Pomona agreed with City of Harare in 2019 to transform the Pomona dumpsite.

Between 16 megawatts (MW) and 20MW will be generated and fed into the national grid from the waste-to-energy plant.

Nguwaya said discussions with the City of Harare, which has been struggling to collect waste in the capital, were still underway.

With garbage being a core raw material required to set up the power generation plant, Nguwaya added that Geo Pomona Waste Management would require 1 000 tonnes of waste to generate electricity.

Several other companies have also commenced small scale power generation at their operations for internal consumption, with surplus being directed to the national grid.

Last week, Gloria Magombo, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Power Development, said small scale power projects like these would be vital to help Zimbabwe deal with power deficits.

Power generation has mainly been affected by droughts, especially at the hydro power station in Kariba. Zimbabwe requires an estimated 4 000MW to power its industries and for domestic use per day.

However, as a result of limited generating capacity, the southern African country bridges its deficit through imports.

""We plan to incinerate 1 000 tonnes per day of solid municipal waste to produce 16MW to 22MW of electricity, which will be fed to the national grid for the benefit of the country,"" Nguwaya said.

""This is a sustainable way of managing waste and reducing the waste that goes to landfills. Previously, the (Pomona) site lacked proper access due to overflowing waste.""

The investment project has triggered fears that City of Harare workers under its public works department may lose jobs when Geo Pomona Waste Management starts to collect garbage.

However, Nguwaya allayed those fears, indicating that the scope of the project entailed retaining jobs.

""These are some of the issues that are under discussion. We do not believe in exclusionary business practices. The plan is to employ the City of Harare workers, who might be directly affected,"" Nguwaya explained.

The decision to pave the way for Geo Pomana Waste Management to start collecting garbage was based on the failure by Harare to effectively collect waste in most parts of the capital, forcing some residents to engage private garbage collectors at monthly costs of around US$90 per household.

In Harare, areas like the central business district suffer from chronic litter and neglect, with piles of refuse accumulating unchecked for extended periods.

Apart from Harare, other local authorities in Zimbabwe have been battling to come up with a lasting solution to address the eyesore problem of garbage.",newsday.co.zw,news,NewsDay Zimbabwe,Tinashe Kairiza,-0.2313725490196078,453028657,5,https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/theindependent/uploads/2024/05/5WSC5emLTfgoEUgpTjLAvagSQiKWWKT4wPLbnUUQ.jpg,

In this context, dual land use concepts, especially agricultural PV, are gaining importance. At Intersolar Europe, the world's leading exhibition for the solar industry, visitors will have the opportunity to see a varied range of technologies, products and solutions for agricultural PV, and to gain deeper insights into best practices and the latest developments. Intersolar Europe will take place from June 19-21, 2024 as part of The smarter E Europe, the continent's largest alliance of exhibitions for the energy industry, in Munich.

Agriculture or renewable sources of energy -- in the past, it was either, or. Agricultural PV is a new, innovative approach offering promising options for agriculture and climate protection by joining agricultural production and the generation of electricity on the same surface.

Extensive subsidies

European countries such as Germany and France subsidize agricultural PV with the aim of deploying more solar energy while reducing the competition for land use. Germany has introduced a separate auction segment with a top value for ""special solar installation"" (which includes agricultural PV installations) in the Solar Package 1, and France is deemed one of the pioneers for dedicated legislation. Other countries, such as Austria and the Netherlands, also promote their agricultural PV sector.

Benefits of agricultural PV

The advantages of dual land use are obvious: It reconciles solar energy with agriculture, and the protection against storm, hale, frost and draught adds an extra bonus for farmers. The electricity production costs are lower than from small roof-mounted installations, and farmers' income is diversified. Shading and wind protection provided by solar panels reduces evaporation, and innovative solar panels have been developed that also collect rainwater for irrigation. This can benefit farming operations by boosting their resilience against crop failure.

Best practice projects

Pilot projects are emerging all over Europe. In the Dutch local authority of Meierijstad, for example, BayWa r.e. AG and their subsidiary GroenLeven are implementing a pioneering agricultural PV project, a 8.7 megawatt peak solar installation covering a vast raspberry plantation. On Sicily, figs and olives grow between the module rows of Europe's largest agricultural PV plant. In Neißeaue, Germany, Next2Sun Technology works on a 20 megawatts solar farm with vertical modules.

Intersolar Europe 2024: special attention on agricultural PV

Intersolar Europe is putting a particular focus on agricultural PV. A special exhibit in the Outdoor Area will be dedicated to the topic. Partners of the special exhibit are BayWa AG, BayWa r.e., Conexio PSE, Vista Geo and ZIMMERMANN PV-Steel Group. What's more, of the more than 1,370 Intersolar Europe exhibitors, some 60 exhibitors will be showcasing agricultural PV products and solutions. Experts will dive deeper into the topic and offer even wider information at a number of sessions at the Intersolar Forum and the Intersolar Europe Conference.

Perceptions around nuclear security threats became particularly serious after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States (US). Since then, the international nuclear community has channeled their efforts to build and strengthen global institutions, norms, and regimes in order to build and/or sustain robust and protective mechanisms in the nuclear security domain.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) defines nuclear safety as ""the achievement of proper operating conditions, prevention of accidents or mitigation of accident consequences, resulting in protection of workers, the public and the environment from undue radiation hazards."" Meanwhile, nuclear security, according to IAEA is ""the prevention and detection of, and response to, criminal or intentional unauthorized acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive material, associated facilities or associated activities."" Nuclear security also encompasses ""The prevention and detection of and response to, theft, sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other malicious acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive substances or their associated facilities."" While both are aimed at safeguarding nuclear materials and protecting humans and the environment around them, the similarity ends there. Nuclear security is primarily about intentional and malicious actions that could threaten human lives; nuclear safety, meanwhile, is about ensuring that rules, regulations and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are adhered to in order to avoid any accident.

The past decade has seen renewed interest in updating mechanisms to counter nuclear security threats at both the domestic and international levels. The Nuclear Security Summits, and the national pledges made during those events, are manifestations of such focus. In the Indian context, the security environment warrants additional attention to nuclear safety and security mechanisms, specifically the institutional infrastructure in an effort to strengthen policies and practices further.

The growing worries are not unfounded. As of the end of 2019, the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) of the IAEA contained 3,686 confirmed incidents classified as ""unauthorised activities and events"" that involved nuclear and other radioactive material, going back to 1993. In 2019 alone, there were 189 such incidents.

Globally, the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) initiative, first held in 2010, was an international effort to bring focused attention on the security of nuclear materials across the globe and address the vulnerabilities that might exist in the security practices. Three such other summits have been held since -- in 2012, 2014 and 2016. Though this effort was not under the aegis of the United Nations, it helped in getting many countries to make individual pledges in the form of 'gift baskets', or voluntary national commitments. Inspired by the in-depth focus at the NSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a promise to play a leading role to keep the discussions going.

A robust discussion on nuclear safety and security requires a deeper look at the various issues that govern the success and improvement of the nuclear safety and security architecture. This report identifies the importance of nuclear safety and security by analysing existing programmes, practices, and infrastructures as well as insider threat, emergency response preparedness, and emerging technology threats.

2. Safety and Security in the Nuclear Power Sector

At present, there are 443 Nuclear Power Reactors in operation in 31 countries, generating approximately 10 percent of electricity worldwide. Additionally, 52 reactors are under construction, mostly in China, India, and Russia. The massive accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in March 2011 caused no loss of life, but disrupted the global nuclear renaissance as several countries decided to phase out their nuclear power programmes.

India is not deterred, though, owing to its large-scale requirements for diversified energy sources. However, the country has been tightening its safeguards to ensure better nuclear security practices. There are 23 nuclear power reactors in operation today across India, with an additional 11 under construction. The country has also signed a number of nuclear cooperation agreements with countries including the US, Russia, France, Canada, and UK.

Nuclear power is crucial in many countries' development goals, including India, as renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are not sufficient to meet energy requirements as well as global climate goals. Nuclear power presents India with the opportunity to enhance its energy security and help reduce global CO emissions and minimise global warming and climate change.

Indeed, nuclear energy is vital to ensuring that affordable energy is available to all; its role in the promotion of clean energy cannot be ignored. It has emerged as an important carbon-free energy option to generate electricity in a safe and sustainable manner. The 2019 World Energy Council report stated that ""nuclear energy will feature in the future global energy mix and make its contribution to sustainable development."" For nuclear energy to take its place as a major low-carbon energy source, states must address issues of cost, policy, and safety. Nuclear energy projects must incorporate designs with inherent and passive safety features. Nuclear safeguards are of paramount importance for public acceptance and long-term sustainability of nuclear power. Nuclear facilities also require nuclear security features to prevent clandestine diversion of fissile and fertile materials for non-peaceful use.

3. Emergency Response Preparedness

Emergency response preparedness is an essential aspect of nuclear safety and security. According to the IAEA, emergency response preparedness refers to effective national and global response arrangements and capabilities to minimise the impacts from nuclear and radiological incidents and emergencies.

India has an extensive nuclear energy establishment, and as such is required to promptly and adequately determine and effectively undertake appropriate action to protect the public and emergency workers. Emergency response within nuclear facilities operates through three phases: early and intermediate (response), and late (recovery). Emergency management involves different types of exercises. For example, table-top exercises are conducted periodically with an emphasis on the decision-making processes and protective actions in the early phase of an emergency. These exercises are based on emergency classifications divided across levels of emergency action as well as real-time analyses.

In the Indian atomic energy sector, Integrated Command Control & Response (ICCR) Exercises focus on testing command and control functions, response mechanisms, and communication. ICCR exercises also include activation of the emergency response framework and response centres (site emergency center, off-site emergency support center, emergency operation center); execution of response functions by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), and district authorities; effectiveness of the liaison between on-site and off-site facilities for sharing information and making decisions; and checking the response timeline for declaration, activation and initial response, as well as coordination between plant and district authorities for the preparation of media briefings and press releases. Additionally, given the proximity of population centres to nuclear facilities, field exercises and public interactions are an important requirement of emergency management in India.

Newer reactors in India are equipped with built-in safety measures that are designed to minimise risks. For example, new light water and heavy water reactors at nuclear plants such as Tarapur nuclear power plant in the state of Maharashtra and the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu have double containment to ensure that nuclear material is confined in case of a nuclear emergency. Pressurised water reactors (PWRs) are equipped with steel line double containment that meet international guidelines. These safeguards, based on technology developed in Fukushima, are indigenously developed in India. They form part of the country's efforts to build robust mitigation measures as well as reduce the risk in evacuation environments and impact on locals in nearby areas.

India has designed a number of control centres responsible for nuclear safety, based on Fukushima safety measures. India's DAE and the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) have 24x7 emergency control rooms that have a human crew who monitor and respond to emergencies. India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has its own system as well and coordinates with other agencies on safety measures. Additionally, India has on-site emergency response centres to plan and initiate actions based on the phase and level of emergencies. The safeguards mechanism is designed to interact and coordinate across agencies to effectively identify and respond to emergency situations.

The nuclear power infrastructure in India also has off-site emergency support centres. These centres are responsible for intermediate phase-level emergency and can handle protective action recommendations based on field measurements including changes/lifting of early phase actions, action for identification of actual affected areas through measurement and survey, protective action recommendation based on field survey and assessment, as well as preparation of write-ups for media briefings. Favourable public opinion is an important aspect of confidence-building measures and must be predicated upon continuous and better communication at the local and national levels between nuclear authorities and the public.

The objective of emergency preparedness is to prevent and minimise the impact of any nuclear or radiological incident on both workers and the larger public. The response plan for a nuclear emergency entails notification, activation, request for assistance, and protective action. First responders to such emergencies are required to prevent spread of contamination and restrict entry to the area of accident. Key is recognising the existence of an emergency situation, identifying and characterising the source and origin, monitoring the magnitude, and providing reliable communication to personnel from medical, civil, police and transport agencies.

Responding to emergency situations requires continuous assessment of emergency levels, determining the area for counter-measures, decision-making on protective measures for public and the surrounding environment, as well as prediction of contamination levels. For example, the DAE's Emergency Control Room (ECR) is responsible for the dissemination of authentic information regarding emergencies to the control rooms and response teams across agencies such as the AERB. The nearest ECRs are alerted for response deployment and briefings for further information dissemination. Based on the information provided through timely briefings, the level of emergency and conclusion of the emergency is determined by the AERB.

The action plan for emergency response teams involves collection of emergency kits, reaching incident sites, informing other teams about their arrival, identifying all possible hazards, carrying out radiological assessment of the area/ orphan source, determining the cordoned area, assessing contamination level, identifying hotspot or locating the source, identifying the source, advising on decontamination measures, collecting soil, gas, water sampling for analysis and finally, initiating source recovery operation. SOPs are in place that factor in communication, fire, plant, site, offsite, transportation and public emergencies.

India's national emergency response system architecture is a combination of the Indian Environmental Radiation Monitoring Network (IERMON) network, ERC network, meteorological data network, emergency communication rooms, Crises Management Group (CMG), National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), and NDMA (see Figure 1). Effective and procedural communication between all actors and institutions involved in emergency response is a crucial aspect in averting crises as a result of an emergency. Successful inter-agency coordination and provision and dissemination of accurate information are key to handling an emergency efficiently.

4. The Human Factor

The roles played by different actors -- international organisations, the state, the public, employees, managers, and licensees -- are key to shaping a nuclear security culture. Nuclear safety and security require the bridging of divergent cultures as they often involve individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences. A positive security culture incorporates norms, attitudes, beliefs, and values that determine how people are expected to behave in order to ensure security practices of an organization to contribute to effective daily operations.

'Nuclear safety culture' refers to the assembly of characteristics and attitudes in organisations and individuals, establishing nuclear safety as an overriding priority, wherein nuclear plant safety issues receive the attention warranted by their significance. It also ensures that human actions are consistent, appropriate, and correct, aiming to prevent human error to the maximum level possible, all of which is predicated upon openness, transparency, and information sharing.

'Nuclear security culture', meanwhile, is the assembly of characteristics, attitudes and behaviours of individuals, organisations and institutions which serves as a means to support and enhance nuclear security. This relies on trustworthiness, honesty and integrity of individuals not to engage in malicious acts and is based on compartmentalisation, secrecy, and classifications.

An effective nuclear security culture depends on proper planning, training, awareness, operations, and maintenance as well as on the actions of people who plan, operate, and maintain nuclear security systems. An organisation may be technically competent while remaining vulnerable if it discounts the role of the human factor. Human factor is important to maintaining effective nuclear security. Humans either comply with rules-based frameworks or challenge and question them as a result of their attitudes and value systems. In order to promote an effective security culture, it is important to encourage employees to support and contribute to security objectives rather than feeling like they are simply the passive victims of security rules and regulations.

The biggest threat to nuclear security lies in complacency. Such threat may arise because of absence of security-related crises, low priority of security in operational activity, human nature for denial and skepticism, failure of senior management to act as role models, scarcity of resources, outdated procedures, and poor attitude towards those that report faults and flaws or issues from management.

Cross-functional communication is an important pillar of a positive culture, which is based on trust and listening. This requires the establishment of need-to-know levels of information for individuals, on a hierarchical basis and based on security clearances, while also prioritising transparency to the highest possible level. A need-to-know hierarchy allows security departments to share relevant information openly with their cross-functional counterparts within the organisation while still maintaining confidentiality for classified information. Additionally, it is important to seek common ground between management and security personnel to further promote a positive security culture. A positive need-to-know model would be based on the convergence of position (threat perception and information sharing), interests (jobs, safety, efficiency, preventing crises) and needs (protecting the health and safety of families and communities), where exchanging information and conflict-resolution together is possible.

Personnel reliability programmes (PRPs) require basic understanding of what motivates people who are a crucial asset in the workplace. These programmes are developed as a result of careful screening and vetting potential employees in the 'pre-employment' stage to observing and assessing employees in the 'during-employment' stage, to carefully managing the separation process in the 'post-employment' stage. A variety of measures are generally applied on a graded basis. PRPs include the following:

PRPs require a focus on recognising behaviour that is concerning or deviant, reporting of serious concerns, special considerations for reporting security-related concerns, reporting policy written standards, in-house complaint process, developing employee discussions and focus groups, and a security liaison programme. A security management programme effectively engages with regulatory bodies and civic society.

Trends in nuclear security refers to features that are well-established in security cultures across the world. One example is 'security by design', in which facilities and systems are designed from the outset to accommodate the needs and requirements of both security and safety. Similarly, material control and accountancy (MC&A) systems are used to detect and prevent the misuse of nuclear and other radioactive material -- both internationally and within a particular State. Modeling and simulation (M&S) and such other approaches contribute to security planning, assessment, training and emergency response and continuous maintenance of security-related aspects in nuclear facilities.

Threat identification in nuclear security occurs through a Design Basis Threat (DBT) system that looks at identifying potential threats in detail so that nuclear security standards and protection measures can be designed and implemented to counter them through a graded approach. Such an approach helps avoid the possibility of ineffective security measures that may leave materials vulnerable, as well as excessive security measures that could unnecessarily impact operations and security measures.

Nuclear security trends emphasise on the ""defense-in-depth"" principle which involves multiple layers of systems and measures that must be circumvented before physical protection is compromised. Over the years, new challenges to nuclear security continue to emerge such as cyber threats i.e., internet security, mobile devices, The Internet of Things (IOTs) and social media, threats to Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) that comprise devices that control, monitor, and manage critical infrastructure in industrial sectors.

While rare, insider threat is among the most critical obstacles to maintaining effective nuclear security. Sabotage must be treated seriously as there has been an increase in the number of incidents globally involving employees who may either have been radicalised or coerced, or else motivated by financial greed or simply disgruntled. An insider threat could succeed with a combination of needs and motivations, access, and opportunity, as well as knowledge of assets and operations. Based on clearance levels, an insider may possess in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures and personnel which can be used against the organisation. Personnel reliability programmes are therefore important.

To reduce insider threat, it is important to develop ethical leadership, strengthen synergy between nuclear safety and security, improve security culture, provide clear written procedures and promote its adherence, and establish open communication channels. The establishment of human reliability programmes with continuous employee evaluation, comprehensive background checks, and medical and psychological evaluations further work to reduce insider threat.

The process of background checks and vetting done prior to employment is also essential to verify criminal antecedent behaviors by local law enforcement. Additionally, special verification by central agencies as well as positive vetting or re-vetting undertaken while in a sensitive job is essential. Likewise, for contractors, similar procedures exist.

In recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on individuals and given rise to fear and uncertainty on their work front as well as in their personal lives. In this regard, the possible manifestation of an insider threat -- theorised as a combination of personal predisposition, stressors, and concerning behaviours -- should not be ruled out.

5. Emerging Cybersecurity Challenges

Cyber threats present a new and unique challenge to nuclear systems and facilities and therefore require appropriate policies. These encompass cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, malware attacks, and distributed denial of service (DDoS). In 2003, for example, the Davis-Besse Nuclear power plant in Ohio, US, suffered a computer worm infection which compromised the safety control system for over four hours; in 2015, hackers targeted the Hanford nuclear site in Washington to gain sensitive information.

A cyber-nuclear security nexus demands an assessment of the origins of the threats. Threats can emerge from state actors, non-state actors (such as terrorist organisations, hackers, lone-actors) and insiders. The severity of an attack can be determined through level of access gained into the systems. Infiltration of malware or viruses into the systems can occur at several stages in the production and supply chain.

Cyber-attacks have economic, operational, and reputational costs to a country. Any breach of safety gives rise to distrust of the systems and may negatively impact relations with allies and partners as well as adversaries alike and call into question the reliability of a country possessing nuclear materials.

Insider threat manifestation in the area of cyber vulnerabilities cannot be ruled out either. Nuclear security is predicated upon the human factor and therefore, increases the threats to nuclear systems. As nuclear systems are managed and operated by individuals with different security clearances, insider threats occur in the case of cyber security through possible exposure of the structure to cyber infiltration from within.

The importance of cyber security of the nuclear architecture is not any different for India. In 2013, the Department of Electronics and Information Technology released its first-ever policy framework to articulate a national cyber security policy. India has a number of institutions responsible for cyber security. India's defense cyber agency creates mechanisms within the security infrastructure to battle cyberwarfare and cyber infiltration in India's defense networks.

The September 2019 cyber-attack on the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant highlighted the importance of strengthening the country's cyber-nuclear security infrastructure. ISRO also confirmed that it was alerted to a breach attempt by the same virus that targeted Kudankulam. The CISAG and CERT-In carried out cyber security audits and argued for further strengthening of the cyber security framework through ""hardening of internet and administrative intranet connectivity, restriction on removable media, blocking of websites & IPs which have been identified with malicious activity etc."" Therefore, it is important to strengthen atomic energy infrastructure against cyber threats using preventive access tools and continual assessment and improvement of the cyber security infrastructure in the nuclear domain.

India would do well to draw lessons from the experiences of other countries like the US, UK, and Japan, which have advanced cyber systems to strengthen cyber protection of their nuclear infrastructure. India could also engage in multilateral dialogues, and collaborate with the private sector in order to build a robust cyber security system for its nuclear architecture.

6. Conclusion

The onus of responsibility for nuclear safety and nuclear security remains with the individual sovereign nation. Yet, this is also an issue that requires greater global cooperation. Principles ensuring nuclear security are based on multi-tier protection systems, and involving technological aspects, security framework, and SOPs, all firmly instituted and scrupulously enforced.

National commitment to nuclear security requires legal instruments (conventions and treaties), high-level national engagement (NSS; other global initiatives, e.g., Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT); IAEA's Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Security (ICONS)); multi-lateral engagement (forum, initiatives by IAEA, GICNT); bilateral cooperation and engagements; as well as track-two platforms.

National systems for nuclear security must work towards legal provision and empowerment through framework and regulatory systems and entities in order to build technological capability and capacity. Effective implementation and enforcement is important in fostering a nuclear security culture that is efficient.

Periodic reviews are essential to ensure improvement of nuclear security systems. India is party to 13 Instruments to combat international terrorism, including the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (ICSANT), and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM). In order to promote India's cooperation with the international community, it supports and voluntarily adopts the IAEA Code of Conduct on the safety and security of radioactive sources and applies IAEA guidance on physical protection of nuclear materials.

India also adheres to NSG guidelines on supply of nuclear items, participates in IAEA's ITDB, and cooperates with Interpol's Radiological and Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Unit & World Customs Organisation. India's proposal at the NSS for a Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership GCNEP-DAE in Bahadurgarh has been viewed as a signal of India's willingness to share its nuclear expertise and cooperate with other nations.

India could strengthen its leadership role in nurturing global governance measures on nuclear security. Legal instruments such as the CPPNM are a case in point. A peer review mechanism was explicitly excluded during the negotiations of the CPPNM 2005 Amendment. However, there is scope for individual Parties to share their experiences on implementation for the benefit of all and to discuss areas where international cooperation, criminalisation or extraditions have been either successful or problematic. The goal is to achieve high standards of implementation, which supports the purpose of the Convention.

Nuclear security is important for India for a number of reasons. As India has a large nuclear programme and its atomic energy facilities are spread across the country, and also considering that the country's immediate neighbourhood is not benign, there are significant vulnerabilities to nuclear terrorism and other threats. There is a growing need for international consensus on how to continually work and improve the nuclear safety and security infrastructure. For example, the CPPNM amendment has brought together different actors on the same platform to take a deeper look at nuclear security.

The paradox is that nations are faced with the dilemma of what level of information should be shared in the interest of nuclear security. At an international level, nations lean towards discussing their achievements more than the shortcomings and subsequent lessons learned. Furthermore, international cooperation is hampered by ongoing geopolitical issues.

Given the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear security incident, states must come together to frame new rules of the road, akin to the IAEA Convention on Nuclear Safety. This process should ensure the participation of all states and other stakeholders. Even as there might be compromises to accommodate different stakeholder perspectives, an instrument that has the inclusion of a large number of stakeholders can help in better adherence to global norms.

Endnotes

The IAEA established the ITDB in 1995 to track nuclear security incidents such as theft, loss of material, and sabotage. The database also monitors incidents of illicit trafficking and other unauthorised activities and events involving nuclear and other radioactive material.

Following a massive earthquake and tsunami, the power supply and cooling of three reactors, caused a major nuclear accident. This accident caused the three reactor cores to melt and high radioactive release of around 940 PBq. The accident led to all four of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors being written off and required two weeks to stabilise the reactor units with water.

After the Fukushima accidents, a number of countries reassessed their nuclear safety measures to undertake stronger safety protocols for their nuclear plants. These measures include ""'stress tests' to reassess the design of nuclear power plants against site specific extreme natural hazards; installing additional backup sources of electrical power and supplies of water, and strengthening the protection of plants against extreme external events; and changes and reforms of organizational and regulatory systems"". In India, safety enhancements included ""additional emergency power sources, enhanced onsite water inventories, external water injection arrangements (Hook up points), measures related to hydrogen management, containment venting provision, seismic trip, mobile pumps, onsite emergency support Centre"".

They may also be responsible for lifesaving rescue, emergency first-aid as well as response to loss or theft of material. The first responders include fire personnel, radiation protection experts and officers.

The ERC network consists of 23 DAE ERCs and 7 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) ERCs.

The concern is not only the rank-and-file, but also includes the upper-tier of managers and leaders.

Additionally, the NTRO is responsible for India's cyber intelligence and counterintelligence operations. There also exists a network of Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) at the local level which reports to a national level CERT-In for emergency response in the cyber domain. The Computer Information and Security Advisory Group (CISAG) was set up with the DAE to audit IT systems as the risks of potential attacks on systems have increased.

It has been a long week. Everyone is, I'm sure worn out. So far, Rosie seems to be tolerating her third chemo treatment much better than her first two. I want to thank everyone for the good thoughts, kind wishes, and prayers for her. Also, there was a misfire with the GoFundMe. Nothing involving what TaMara did, just some back end issues that have to be resolved. Which is why I asked TaMara to pull it down for now. She has and anyone that already donated will be getting a full refund. Thank you all so much, but for now it's not going forward. Should we get the issues resolved, things change, and we put it back up, we'll let everyone know. But I do want anyone who did donate and who is getting a refund to know that I appreciate what you did very, very, very much!

As I have been writing tonight's update, so about the past 20 minutes - it's now 6:50 PM EDT - the air raid alerts have begun to go up over Ukraine. When I started writing around 6:30 PM EDT, air raid alerts were up over Luhansk and Crimea, which is normal as they are always up over Luhansk and Crimea. They were also up over Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblasts. Over the past twenty minutes air raid alerts have gone up over Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts.

It's now 7:10 PM EDT and the air raid alerts for Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk Oblasts have been taken down.

The Russians hammered Sumy Oblast again today. And by hammered, I mean attempted to pulverize!

Russian forces attacked Sumy Oblast 302 times in 60 separate attacks throughout the day, firing at 11 communities along the border on May 9, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported.

The communities of Bilopillia, Yunakivka, Khotin, Krasnopillia, Velyka Pysarivka, Shalyhyne, Novoslobidske, Seredyna-Buda, Esman, Myropillia, and Putyvl were targeted.

Throughout the day, Russia assailed the border communities with mortar, drone, rockets, and artillery attacks, while dropping explosives from drones onto two of the communities.

No casualties or injuries were reported.

The town of Velyka Pysarivka, located directly on Ukraine-Russia border, with a pre-war population of about 4,000 residents, experienced the bulk of the attacks reported with 67 explosions recorded in the area.

Given the town's proximity to Russia, Velyka Pysarivka has become a main target of attack for Russia over recent months. Much of the community's infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian attacks.

Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months. Amid intensified attacks, Ukrainian authorities ordered increased evacuations from the region.

Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region's vulnerable border settlements experience multiple attacks per day.

The Russians have not forgotten about and are not finished with Kharkiv:

9 May 2024 - 20:41

Dear Ukrainians!

The key points for today.

I held a meeting with the leadership of the Ukrainian Defense Forces: Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi, Chief of the General Staff Barhylevych, and Defense Minister Umerov. We discussed how to speed up the supply of weapons from our partners and how to act now, with the available forces and means, with the available weapons, to achieve the results we need. We see what the occupier is preparing for. There will be a response. And I thank all our soldiers and commanders, every unit that is effectively operating at the front and destroying the occupier. The Kraken unit of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine deserves special gratitude for its fighting these days. I am grateful to you, guys! And to everyone who gives Ukraine the result. The result we need so much. Today, I have also appointed Oleksandr Trepak as a new commander of the Special Operations Forces. He is a decent man, a strong warrior, a Hero of Ukraine.

The second for today. The visit of the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola to Ukraine. It is very symbolic that today, on Europe Day, our conversation with journalists was interrupted by an air raid alert. This is what the Russian Nazis want to replace life with, not just in Ukraine, but in our entire Europe, wherever their terrorist strikes reach. They will neither intimidate nor break Ukraine, nor will they break all those who bravely and resolutely help us defend life. Madam President of the European Parliament is exactly the kind of leader who has been with us since the first days of this war, and has always supported us as much as we need. Today, we discussed with Roberta what other political and defense steps are needed to ensure that we can truly withstand all the attacks and thwart Russia's offensive and destabilization plans.

Today I would also like to thank all the participants of the Second Summit of Ukrainian and European Communities held here in Kyiv. The countries of the European Union, as well as the United States, were represented. It is very important that there are cooperation agreements between our communities and the communities and companies of partner countries: Germany, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Austria, Romania, and the United States. These include the development of healthcare in Ukraine, rehabilitation opportunities in our communities, as well as the development of transport, recovery. I am grateful to all the participants of the Summit - every community, every country that stands with Ukraine, filling each of the agreements reached with real cooperation.

And of course, there was a lot of international communication today. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel. Also, I have just spoken with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We are actively preparing the next stage of rapprochement with the European Union for June - we anticipate the adoption of the negotiating framework and the actual start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession. Our country, our people deserve this. And the European Union needs this step not just politically, as it is the lifeblood of the European Union to be a European project that leaves no one outside the EU, no one who truly professes European values. And I was also pleased today to hear the full support of our European friends for the Peace Summit - I am grateful to every leader who has already confirmed their participation in the Summit and is willing to help us effectively in engaging leaders.

Today, in conversations, I personally invited the Presidents of Moldova, the Czech Republic and Ghana, as well as the Prime Minister of Ireland to the Summit. Of course, we also discussed our bilateral agenda. Moldova - we have obvious common challenges and help each other. The Czech Republic - I expressed my gratitude for the initiative on artillery, and the most important thing now is the full and immediate implementation of the initiative. Ghana - the world relies on the stability and development of Africa. We have recently opened an embassy in Ghana, and this country now has a new accredited ambassador in Kyiv. Together we can add more strength to our parts of the world. Ireland - I thanked them for their support of our state and people, I thanked them for the fact that Ireland is really trying to help us politically, and also in the protection of life - in the demining of our land. And this support will increase - more territory of Ukraine will be cleared of Russian mines and ordnance.

So, this day and this week added support to our warriors, our state, our diplomacy. and to the Peace Summit. Every day in the diplomatic marathon, we are making the Peace Summit and the approach of peace a reality. Thank you to all the leaders who help!

I thank everyone who defends Ukraine and life! I thank everyone who gives us strength!

Glory to Ukraine!

Two Ukrainian hydroelectric power plants will not be functioning due to damage caused by the Russian missile attack on May 8th - Ukrhydroenergo.

""To date, all hydro generation has suffered devastating damage. Destroyed equipment requires considerable efforts for repair and restoration, as well as significant financial resources,"" Ukrhydroenergo added.

Never? Again.

⚡️Germany to buy 3 HIMARS for Ukraine.

Germany will buy three HIMARS multiple rocket launchers for Ukraine, the country's defense minister announced on May 9. Speaking during a trip to Washington, Boris Pistorius said they would be purchased from the U.S. and handed over to Kyiv.

⚡️Bloomberg: Pentagon blocks Russian military from accessing Starlink in Ukraine.

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-pentagon-blocks-russian-military-from-accessing-starlink-in-ukraine/

Frankly I'm amazed by this. Here are the details from The Kyiv Independent:

The U.S. Pentagon is preventing the Russian military from using Starlink internet terminals operated on the battlefield in Ukraine, John Plumb, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense, said in an interview with Bloomberg on May 9.

Starlink, recognized for its superior security compared to cellular or radio signals, is deemed crucial for Ukrainian operations. Last year, the Pentagon reached an agreement with SpaceX to financially support access for the Ukrainian military.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's military intelligence chief told the Wall Street Journal that Russian forces in Ukraine are using thousands of Starlink satellite communications terminals made by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

According to Plumb, the U.S. has become ""heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals.""

Ukraine heavily depends on Starlink, having reported last year that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.

""At this time we have successfully countered Russian use, but I am certain Russia will continue to try and find ways to exploit Starlink and other commercial communications systems,"" Plumb said. ""It will continue to be a problem, I think we've wrapped our heads around it and found good solutions with both Starlink and Ukraine.""

The American official did not specify what tactics are being used to block Russian access to Starlink terminals inside Ukraine.

Following the publication of Budanov's interview with the WSJ, two Democrats in the U.S. Congress, Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's SpaceX company, demanding information on Russia's alleged usage of the Starlink satellite internet terminals.

Ukraine's military intelligence said that Russia has allegedly been purchasing Starlink terminals from ""Arab countries,"" citing intercepted communications.

Elon Musk denied that SpaceX had sold Starlink units to Russia and said Starlink would not connect to any devices there.

Both military intelligence and media reports said that Russian forces connected Starlink in occupied Ukraine, not on Russian territory.

Plumb affirmed that SpaceX has become a ""reliable partner"" in Ukraine.

""To me, they're a very reliable partner, and they are also 'innovating at speed,' providing services that are useful to the Defense Department.""

SpaceX began providing the Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The potential/expected Russian spring offensive:

""This used to be an old Soviet radio station, but we have gutted it and installed this equipment given to us by volunteers. We did it all ourselves,"" Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Timchenko, commander of the air-defence unit, says proudly. Plots on the monitor show the flight paths of Russian jets, helicopters and missiles. Lines showing Smerch rockets travelling at 1,400kph (900mph) criss-cross the screen; one heads directly towards the hamlet, but passes overhead. A Russian warplane comes close to the front, releases its bomb and makes a -turn. Less than a minute later the glide bomb (a regular bomb fitted with fins to greatly increase its range) disappears from the screen, exploding well inside Ukraine.

Colonel Timchenko's air-defence unit cannot hit the Russian planes and has no way of intercepting glide bombs. Its job is to warn artillery units and mobile groups operating along the front. Hidden in the brush on a hill a few kilometres from the hamlet, three of the battalion's 250 men huddle around a Strela-10, an old Soviet short-range mobile surface-to-air missile system. Designed to bring down planes, it now hunts Russian drones. In the eight months that Colonel Timchenko has been here his men have shot down 50.

Tall and composed, the commander is a Russian-speaker from Kharkiv. He has been fighting since February 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas, supposedly to ""save"" Russian-speakers like him. The war, he says, is not about language, ethnicity or even territory, but a way of life. ""I don't want to be part of Russia. I don't want to go to prison for expressing my opinions. I want my children to grow up in a normal country, maybe not a rich country, but a free country."" An avid reader of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he does not want to live in a new ""Gulag Archipelago"".

The purpose of the fighting around Chasiv Yar is not to retain every inch of land, but to prevent the Russian army from sweeping across the rest of Ukraine and taking its main cities, including Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odessa and Kyiv. Similarly, Mr Putin is not interested in the Donbas for its territory; he is trying to subjugate Ukraine and end its quest to become part of the European order. Last week Emmanuel Macron, France's president, told The Economist that this order could perish ""much more quickly than we think"". Ukraine is where the fight is taking place.

A year ago, as Ukraine readied for its counter-offensive, just holding its own positions was considered the most pessimistic scenario. Now, as Russia prepares for a fresh push, it is considered the best case. From soldiers to generals, everyone The Economist spoke to over the past week knows that Ukraine lacks the resources to get back to its 1991 borders, as its politicians have promised. ""I suggest to anyone who talks of 1991 borders to come as far as Bakhmut,"" Colonel Timchenko says, referring to a town Ukraine lost a year ago after months of savage fighting.

At stake now is not Ukraine's territorial integrity, but its survival. Slowing Russian forces in the Donbas is crucial. Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko, commander of the 92nd, who helped liberate Kharkiv province in September 2022, is now fighting some 350km south-east of the city. ""Everyone knows that if we don't fight for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka [Russia's probable next target], Russian forces will be in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih a few weeks later,"" he says. He thinks there is a ""70% chance"" that Russia can occupy the rest of the Donbas region. The question is how long it might take, and how much damage Ukraine can inflict in the process.

Fearing escalation, the West has never given Ukraine all the weapons it needs. After a six-month gap in American supplies caused by Republican obstruction, it has enough ammunition to survive but not to defeat Russia's forces. By the time a new American aid package was approved on April 24th, it was rationing ammunition. Colonel Fedosenko says he was down to five shells a day for his American Paladin howitzers. ""What am I supposed to do with this number of shells? My men were fighting with spades in trenches."" He hopes the $61bn package's effects will be felt in days, as many of the weapons have been pre-positioned in Poland.

Although Russia has the edge in shells and manpower, Colonel Fedosenko feels it may have reached its peak. Only a few weeks ago, he says, Russian infantry backed by ten to 20 armoured vehicles and tanks were launching assaults every two to three hours. Now they attack only every five days or so, using motorcycles and quad bikes to avoid kicking up dust and advancing in small groups to hunt for weak spots.

Some 70% of the Russian soldiers in such assaults are former convicts, says Colonel Fedosenko. He also sees Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Cuban and Somali mercenaries. Many soldiers have never been in combat before. ""Our interceptions suggest they are scraping the barrel, using whoever they can force into battle -- cooks, builders, mechanics, anyone."" He knows that many Russian soldiers have no choice. ""Most of the prisoners I take are guys from small towns and villages. They tell us that either they get killed here or they get killed there if they run."" Some shoot themselves rather than surrender.

For now, however, Russian forces continue to advance. While Ukraine is not collapsing, it is losing about 20 sq km a week. Mr Putin may want to inflict maximum damage before 's 75th anniversary party in July, to humiliate the West and force Ukraine into negotiations. But since he has not advertised his fresh offensive he would not need to admit its failure either.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin is strangling Ukraine's economy by knocking out much of its electricity generation and wearing down the civilian population by bombing cities. Kharkiv, which is already rationing electricity, is being hit by glide bombs almost daily. Yet the city of more than 1m people is keeping calm and carrying on. On a sunny afternoon last week, residents strolled through a park and attendants went on emptying rubbish bins, even as two glide bombs landed with huge explosions less than a kilometre away. Keeping the city functioning and clean is a way to stand up to destruction and chaos.

With around 50,000 fresh Russian troops gathering across the border some 40km away, Kharkiv's commanders know they may be a target in Russia's next push. One scenario would be to isolate the city by cutting the main road to Kyiv. Another would be to move some 10km closer, putting the city's eastern outskirts within artillery range and creating a buffer zone to protect Belgorod, a Russian city that is being hit by Ukrainian drones.

Konstantin Nemichev is the commander of the famous Kraken regiment, a special-forces outfit formed in the early days of the invasion in 2022 that defended Kharkiv. He expects the enemy to attack the province again in mid-May, but reckons they will fail to get near the city. Interviewed outside a ruined school building in the east of town, the site of an intense firefight in 2022 in which invading soldiers were wiped out, the commander says the defence is much stronger now. It has three lines of fortifications and a full brigade to stop the Russians. ""They can move a few kilometres into the province,"" he says, ""but I don't think they can get as far as 10km.""

The Ukrainian armed forces know they have no choice but to fight on. ""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region. But this sense of urgency and existential threat, he says, needs to penetrate into the whole of Ukrainian society. ""People need to know the truth,"" he says. And Ukraine needs unity as it enters a new stage of conflict.

I want to reemphasize LTC Tkach's assessment:

""We can either fight for Ukraine against Russia, or we will be overrun and forced to fight for Russia against Europe,"" says Oleg Tkach, a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd tank brigade, which defends the Kharkiv region.

Those, as well as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and Ukrainians existence as Ukrainians, are the stakes!

Professor Snyder has posted a new explainer of Russian propaganda. From the Thread Reader App:

President Zelenskyy continues to shake up his senior national security team. From The Kyiv Independent:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the head of Ukraine's State Security Administration (UDO), Serhii Rud, according to a presidential decree published on May 9.

The UDO's main tasks include ensuring the security of the President of Ukraine and high-ranking officials of the state, as well as the protection of administrative buildings and objects of state authorities of Ukraine.

Rud's dismissal comes shortly after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have uncovered a network of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who were plotting to assassinate President Zelensky and other high-ranking officials in Ukraine. Two colonels of the UDO accused of leaking classified information to Russia were reportedly detained.

The FSB network aimed to find perpetrators among the military close to Zelensky's security, ""who could take the head of state hostage and then kill him.""

Just a few weeks before, SBU officials and Polish law enforcement worked to detain a Polish citizen who allegedly offered to Russia to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In late November, Zelensky said in an interview with The Sun that he had survived at least five assassination attempts since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

The Ukrainian president issued several presidential decrees this week mandating changes in senior leadership across Ukraine's government and military.

Dmytro Hereha was reappointed as the commander of Ukraine's Support Forces, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, was formally dismissed from military service. Zaluzhnyi will now serve as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.K.

Russian sources are claiming the Mariupol strike was ATACMS:

A video of the drone attacking the plant in Russian Salavat, Bashkiria, appeared on Russian Telegram channels.

The person who is filming says the drone is very large.

It looks like the drone flew about 1,500 km before it reached its target and hit the oiloil catalytic cracking unit.

Gazprom neftekhim Salavat is one of the largest oil refining and petrochemical production complexes in Russia. It specializes in the production of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other types of petroleum products.

/6. According to Russian media Baza:

""the drone hit the catalytic cracking unit at about one o'clock in the afternoon, local time. Afterwards, employees of the enterprise heard a bang and saw smoke in the area of the Southern entrance. The fire was small, so workers were not evacuated; the plant is operating normally.

According to the head of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Radiy Khabirov, emergency services and heads of law enforcement agencies are now working on the spot. Preliminary, no one was hurt.""

Despite the downturn, the company is steadfast in its commitment to its Sustainable Strategy 2030, focusing on renewable energy expansion and the development of a green hydrogen economy.

VERBUND provided updated financial guidance for 2024, with expected reported and adjusted EBITDA ranging from €2.8 billion to €3.3 billion and a reported Group result between €1.45 billion and €1.75 billion.

The company's net debt improved significantly, and the gearing ratio was reduced to 9.4%.

VERBUND AG (VER.VI) remains focused on its long-term sustainability goals while navigating the current market challenges. The company's strategic investments in renewable energy and infrastructure development are expected to bolster its position in the green economy.

However, the energy sector's volatility and regulatory changes continue to pose risks to the company's financial performance.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Conference Call on the Quarter One 2024 Results of VERBUND AG. I am Vasilios, the Chorus Call Operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. I would like to remind you that the presentation will be followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Peter Kollmann. Please go ahead.

Peter Kollmann: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to the presentation of VERBUND for the first quarter 2024. And let me thank you for joining today's conference call. Before we move into the analysis of the business development of VERBUND, let me make a few general comments. VERBUND can look back on an extremely successful year 2023 with the best result in the company's history and is starting the year 2024 as a strong, resilient and well-positioned company. However, the energy industry value drivers relevant to VERBUND's earnings have deteriorated compared to the highs of 2022 and 2023. Thus, VERBUND earnings declined slightly in the first quarter. The fall in gas prices with its consequences on electricity wholesale prices is due in particular to the lower demand for gas as a result of the mild winter and the rather weak economy in Europe, as well as the comparatively high filling level of gas storage facilities. Now, despite the changed framework conditions in the energy industry, we're working consistently on the implementation of our Sustainable Strategy 2030, which focuses on strengthening our integrated position in the market, the expansion of New Renewable Energy generation in Europe and the development of a green hydrogen economy. Now, before I continue with the Q1 presentation, let me state that the interim report for the first quarter differs slightly from previously published interim reports due to a comprehensive change in the Group-wide platform for data processing and the preparation of management information. Now, let's move on to the financial details of the first quarter 2024. At the beginning, let me highlight the most important influencing factors for the results development. Based on our hedging strategy for our own electricity generation from hydropower, the average achieved contract price decreased by €84.7 to €118.1 per megawatt hour in the first quarter. The hydro coefficient determining the generation from run-of-river hydropower plants was very strong with 1.29 compared to last year and far above the long-term average. However, production from our hydro reservoirs was lowered by 4.8%. Generation from wind and PV was up compared to last year, mainly driven by the commissioning of new power plant capacity in Spain. Thermal generation also increased due to the increased use of our Mellach CCGT. The Sales segment also contributed positively, among others, due to lower procurement costs for energy. Contributions from the Grid segment decreased, mainly coming from lower results of Gas Connect Austria. The same applies to All Other segments whose contributions also decreased, mainly because of negative measurement effects. The contribution from flexibility products was lower, mainly due to a decrease in congestion management and control energy. Finally, a minor negative impact on our results was coming from the levy on excess profits in Spain. There were no impacts in the other countries of operations in the first quarter from levies on excess profits. The impact of these influencing factors on the key figures of VERBUND are as follows. EBITDA decreased by 8.7% to €883 million and the Group result decreased by 4.3% to €506 million. The operating cash flow also decreased to a level of €929 million. The free cash flow after dividends was positive at a level of €675 million and net debt improved by 35.8% to a level of €1.129 million. Let me now give you our updated guidance for 2024. Based on average hydro, wind and PV generation in the quarters two to four, as well as the actual opportunities and risk situation of the Group, VERBUND expects a reported and adjusted EBITDA between approximately €2.8 billion and €3.3 billion, and a reported Group result between approximately €1.45 billion to €1.75 billion in 2024. The payout ratio will be between 45% and 55% of the adjusted Group result between approximately €1.45 billion and €1.75 billion. Now on the next page, let me start with the hedging volumes and hedging prices. As you know, highly relevant to VERBUND results, you know that €1 plus or minus has a sensitivity of approximately €25 million on the EBITDA line. As of the 31st of March, 2024, we reached an average achieved contract price for our hydro generation of €129.5 for 2024 and we had sold approximately 77%, for 2025, we had sold 45% of our own generation at a price of €126.6 and for 2026, we had sold 32% of the generation volumes at €79.4. On a mark-to-market basis, with prices as of the 16th of April, 2024, the average achieved contract price for 2024 is at €118.7 per megawatt hour, for 2025, it is at €112.4 per megawatt hour and for 2026 it is at €82.7 per megawatt hour. Now on the next page, let me comment on some developments in the various business segments of VERBUND and let me start with the Hydro segment. At €1.29, the hydro coefficient, as you know, that's our index quantifying the hydropower generation of the run-of-river power plants, was an impressive 29 percentage points above the long-term average and 36 percentage points above the level of the first quarter 2023. The production from annual storage power plants decreased by 4.8%. Own production from hydropower therefore overall increased by 1.8 terawatt hours or 29.6% to 7.893 terawatt hours compared to the first quarter 2023. Lower average achieved prices, however, could not be compensated by the increase in volume and are the main reason for the decrease in EBITDA in the Hydro segment. In addition, flexibility products decreased by €17.8 million. In total, EBITDA in the Hydro segment decreased by 18% to €714.4 million. Regarding CapEx, our main hydro project, the 480-megawatt Limberg III pump storage power plant and the 45-megawatt Reißeck II pump storage power plants are progressing well. The 11-megawatt run-of-river project Gratkorn as well and the COD is expected in 2024. Now let me continue with the analysis of the own generation from New Renewables. The New Renewables coefficient, that is an index quantifying the generation from wind power and PV, amounted to 0.89 in the first quarter 2024, compared to 1.03 in the first quarter 2023. The generation for wind power nevertheless increased by 65.6%, up 221 gigawatt hours and amounted to 558 gigawatt hours in the first quarter. New installations in Spain and Austria more than compensated for less favorable wind conditions. Generation from PV amounted to 77 gigawatt hours in the reporting period, stemming mainly from PV installations in Spain. Now, taking a look at the EBITDA development in the New Renewables segment, we see that the EBITDA decreased by 6% to an EBITDA amounting to €56.7 million. Although volumes increased due to the acquisition of wind power installations in Spain and in Austria, lower average achieved prices led to a slight decrease in EBITDA. The chart also provides an overview on current developments in the renewables segment. On the next slide, you will find an update of our renewable activities. The chart outlines our New Renewable assets in operation and construction in our market split by technology, as well as our targets for 2030. With that, I would like to hand over to Andreas Wollein, who is going to take us through the Sales segment, the other segments and will continue with the key figures. Please, Andreas.

Andreas Wollein: Yeah. Thank you, Peter. So, on Slide 6, you see the development of the Sales segment in the first quarter. So, the EBITDA development in the Sales segment increased strongly to a slight positive value of €6.8 million after minus €103.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in EBITDA is mainly due to lower procurement prices for electricity and gas. However, lower earnings contributions from flexibility products had an opposite and opposing effect. Flexibility products decreased by around €8 million. For both delivered electricity and gas to approximately 586,000 end customers in Q1 2024. Moving on to the next slide, you see the development in All Other segments. So, generation from our thermal power plants was up by about 6.7% to 328 gigawatt hours due to the increased use of the CCGT Mellach for electricity and district heating production. The decline in EBITDA is mainly due to negative effects from the evaluation of energy derivatives in connection with future energy supplies. The contribution from our participation in Kelag, the provincial utility of Carinthia, increased from €14 million to around €21 million due to a better hydro situation, as well as higher contributions from the trading and heating business. Finally, let me remind you that Mellach is no longer contracted for future congestion management. So, both lines are operated in a market -- on a market driven basis at least until April 1st, 2025. The next slide shows the development in our important regulated Grid segment. So, as you know, the Grid segment consists of the regulated business Austrian Power Grid, as well as Gas Connect Austria. The EBITDA for Q1 2024 from the Grid business according to IFRS was approximately €85 million and therefore more or less equal to last year. EBITDA guidance for the electricity grid for 2024 was increased from approximately €220 million to €235 million. The reasons for the increased guidance are lower procurement costs for control energy and lower congestion management procurement counterbalanced by lower revenues from the yearly auctions. The planned amount of the regulatory account at the end of 2024 will only slightly increase to a level of approximately €515 million. Let me also remind you that starting from January 1st, 2024 a new regulatory period has started. APG receives a weighted average cost of capital of 4.16% for old assets with a commissioning date up to 2022. Weighted average cost of capital of 4.88% for new assets with a commissioning date in 2023 and a WACC of 6.33% for new assets with a commissioning date in 2024. So the total WACC for 2024 is approximately 4.5%. With regard to the result contribution of Gas Connect Austria we report an EBITDA of approximately €26 million in the first quarter 2024. The main reason for the decrease are lower transmission revenues particularly from the commodity tariff. The guidance for 2024 increased from approximately €60 million to approximately €75 million because of lower procurement costs for gas. On the next slide you see the key financial figures. So I think Pete already outlined the development of the EBITDA so it was up by €84 million -- it decreased, sorry, by €84 million to 8.7% to €883 million. Depreciation increased by 10% to €138.6 million due to the acquisition of Spanish assets and increased investments into the high voltage grid. The financial result improved to €16.6 million. This was attributable to higher earnings contributions from interest accounted for using the equity method mainly Kelag, higher interest income and lower interest expenses mainly caused by the repayment of a Schuldscheindarlehen in November 2023 and the amount of around €500 million, as well as lower interest expenses from money market transactions. So taxes and income decreased to an amount of €175 million. The Group result therefore decreased by €22.9 million or 4.3% to €506 million. Yeah. Moving on to the next slide, we see the development of the cash flows and the gearing situation. So, VERBUND operating cash flow in the first quarter decreased to €929 million, mainly due to a lower average price achieved for electricity, as well as lower return flows from the margining payments for hedging transactions in the electricity business which were deposited with the gearing house of the electricity exchange as collateral for open trading positions. In addition, higher income tax payments contributed negatively. The free cash flow after dividends showed a negative development, but it's still very attractive at the level of plus €675 million. The lower operating cash flow and high investments in property, plant and equipment were the reasons for this development. Net debt decreased again from €1.758 billion at the end of 2023 to €1.129 billion at the end of the first quarter 2024 due to the positive free cash flow. Gearing correspondingly decreased to a level of 9.4%, compared to 15.7% at year-end 2023. So now we are coming to the last slide, the outlook and I will hand over again to Peter.

Peter Kollmann: Thank you. Andreas. Yeah. On our earnings outlook 2024, I would like to give you both the outlook and our sensitivities. Now on the sensitivities the deviation of plus minus 1% in the generation from hydropower has an impact of plus minus €8.9 million in the Group result for the whole year, a deviation of plus minus 1% in the generation from wind power and PV has an impact of €0.8 million and a deviation of plus minus €1 in the wholesale price has an impact of €4 million in the Group result for 2024. Our guidance as I mentioned before for 2024 is as follows. We expect a reported and adjusted EBITDA of between €2.8 billion to €3.3 billion and a reported Group result of between €1.45 billion and €1.75 billion under the assumption of average hydro, average wind and PV generation in the quarters two to four, as well as the chances and risk situation of the entire group. For the financial year 2024 we are planning to pay out between 45% and 55% of the Group result after our adjustment for non-recurring effects on the results of €1.45 billion and €1.75 billion. Now, with that, I would like to move on to our Q&A, please?

Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Campbell with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

John Campbell: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. We look at Fortum, one of your peers and they actually happen to provide some guidance on their expected optimization premium. They actually quote a figure of about €6 per megawatt hour to €8 per megawatt hour that they can achieve over wholesale prices. Is this something that VERBUND is likely to offer in the future? And would you say actually as you sit here now that a €6 to €8 premium is something that VERBUND could achieve? And so that was my first question. And then I was also interested on the topic of APG. So, could you clarify where you see the movement in the regulatory account going to, was it €515 million? And then any comments you can give on allowed returns for 2025 assets would be helpful. Thank you.

Peter Kollmann: Yeah. Sure. The first one is an interesting one on the -- I think you called it the optimization premium. We have heard similar points, similar discussions around how can you achieve a higher contract price above sort of like the wholesale price that is given by the market and the definitions vary. When you look at the flexibility products and when you look at congestion management, control energy, intraday trading, pumping and turbining in a way that is an optimization, because what you do is, you use your power generation in order to create a premium to what would under normal circumstances be the normal price. So in a way you could basically take our flexibility products, you could then, of course, take the optimization from our reservoirs and you could say, and that comes in addition to our quote-unquote normal generation. We don't call it optimization. We are -- we very simply say, this is what we make out of selling our generation. This is how much we make in our flexibility products and that is some sort of an optimization. On the second one, Austrian Power Grid, yes, you're right, the regulatory account is high at €515 million. We feel that we should reduce it simply because we want to have a more linear development in the future in terms of the regulatory account. You might remember that already two years ago we said that we are discussing with the regulator to take an approach where every year we reduce the regulatory account. The reduction of the regulatory account of course would mean that the tariff would get reduced, which for the system is a good thing. So far the regulator has decided to keep the regulatory account the way it is. So this is something where we will hopefully over the next few years see a reduction and not an increase in the regulatory account.

Andreas Wollein: John, the return on the investments. So, for 2024, as outlined, we will get for all the investments 6.33%. For 2025 this is open. You know that the regulator or the regulatory system has changed in a way that the regulator will now adjust the risk-free rate every year. So I would say in September, October this year when the grid company receives the cost decree for the coming year the WACC will be set for 2025, but the current expectation is that it will roughly be the same number for 2025. And these numbers -- these returns for each year will then be fixed until the end of the regulatory period.

John Campbell: Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Olly Jeffery: Thank you very much. Good morning. My first question please is on the snowpack level in Austria. I've heard a few different things on this regarding the snowpack level currently compared to seasonal norms and what that might mean to your ability to refill reservoir levels and what that could mean for hydro coefficient for the rest of the year. So is the snowpack level at the moment above norm in line or below? And the second question I have please is on Gas Connect Austria. I believe you were in discussions with the regulator very recently discussing a new business model taking effect from 2025 onwards. Could you please update on the outcome from that and what that might mean for EBITDA from that business going forward from 2025? Thank you very much.

Peter Kollmann: Yeah. Yeah. Surely. I will start with Gas Connect Austria and then talk about the snowpack, the skiing slopes in Austria which you mentioned as your first question. The -- on Gas Connect Austria we don't have a result. We are in the midst of discussions, I should say negotiations with e-control, with the regulator. Obviously, we argue forcefully that the business model of Gas Connect Austria has changed dramatically as a result of the war and as a result of a dramatic decrease in capacity going through our pipelines. We are -- as a result of that, we must, that's not an optionality, we must go from the old regulatory system to a new regulatory system which is a cost plus system, in a way similar to what we have at APG, Austrian Power Grid. We will see what the result is going to be, but there is downside potential. So from an EBITDA development, and I cannot give you a number, I can only give you a trend, we feel that the trend for the future in Gas Connect Austria could be sloping rather down than up. In terms of your first question, yes, you're right. We had an interesting situation where, first of all, everybody, including our sort of like hydrology experts were surprised about the very high levels of our hydro coefficient in the first quarter. You're right, the result was a combination of different things. Number one, we had snow. Then we had warm weather. The snow, obviously, in the form of water, came down. It increased the hydro coefficient quite dramatically. At the same time, at the lower levels, we had a lot of rain. At the very high levels in the mountains, there is still snow and that snow eventually will come down as well. You are asking yourself, and you're not the only one, what does it mean for the rest of the year? Does it mean that we are going to have a higher than normal hydro coefficient for 2024? The answer is, we don't know. I mean, we could have a very good start, followed by a very dry third quarter and a very dry fourth quarter. I mean, we have seen it before. And as a result of that, it could well be that the hydro coefficient at the end of 2024 is going to be somewhere around 1. I mean, obviously, we are happy that we had a good start. That's a good thing. And as I mentioned in my presentation before, we were able to compensate the lower power prices with higher generation, with more volume. That's a good thing and that helped us. But at the end of the day, the weather is close to impossible to predict. Olly, would that be a response that explains your question on the hydro situation?

Olly Jeffery: Yeah. It's helpful. But just one follow-up on it. I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts. But would you say that the current level of snowpack in the Alps means that it should be easier than normal for you to refill the reservoirs, assuming normal rain during the summer or is it quite difficult to tell because of the height at which the snow is, and therefore, you can't really give a view?

Peter Kollmann: Well, it's difficult to tell. I always have an opinion, as you know. If I gave you the correct answer from a purely theoretical point of view, it is close to impossible to make a prediction. However, if you wanted to get a personal opinion, we have in the higher levels of the mountains, we have snowpacks that are relatively close to what we have seen in the last few years. And as a result of that, it should be, in terms of water coming down, both into the reservoirs and into the rivers, it should be not dramatically different from previous years.

Olly Jeffery: Thank you, Peter.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Harrison Williams with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Harrison Williams: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two from me, please. Firstly, on the Sales division, clearly pleasing to see that return to profitability. And it'd be useful just to hear your expectations on that for the year and then what a maybe more normalized run rate would be for that on an annual basis going forward. So that's the first. And then on the second, we are hearing a lot of interest about data center demand growth on the power side. Is that something you see as kind of relevant for VERBUND at present or going forward? Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.

Peter Kollmann: Okay. I'll talk about data centers, and Andreas will talk about the Sales segment. On data centers, I mean, almost everybody on this call has followed a number of trends over the last few years that were widely discussed. We talked a lot about e-mobility. We talked a lot about hydrogen. In fact, hydrogen was probably the biggest trend in terms of a discussion around not just the European energy transformation, but the global energy transformation and now data centers. The one thing, I mean, let's differentiate between sort of like what is a given and what is an uncertainty. As far as I'm concerned, and I'm not a data center specialist, but as far as I'm concerned, the build-out of data centers to me is a reality, because it is a function of AI using way more energy than previous technologies, which is logical if you consider how much information has to be collected by AI and every piece of data collection requires electricity. As a result of that, with AI, the demand for electricity will go up. That is a certainty. The one thing that to me is not certain at all is two things. Number one, what is the distribution of data centers? I don't think the data centers are going to be built where you have a lot of uncertainty because -- uncertainty of supply, because data centers need very, very stable generation. Yeah, as a result of that, you can either have a combination of intermittent power generation combined with battery storage in order to create synthetic baseload or you have data centers where you have a lot of baseload generation, like in some parts of Scandinavia, for example. And then, of course, when you look at the location, you need to look at the data connections. Are the data connections stable enough and are they powerful enough to transport all the data that is required? That is around the location. The next point would be when you consider that there will be a rational and logical approach to where you build the data centers and what the capacity of the data centers is going to be, it will probably be at locations where the impact is going to be manageable. Everything else would be irrational in terms of the planning. As a result of that, we might, and I'm not sure, but we might overestimate the impact of data centers on the electricity price. So, that is all I can say at this point in time, but I obviously appreciate and fully understand the questions around data centers. With that, I would like to hand over to Andreas to talk about the Sales segment.

Andreas Wollein: Yeah. So, as you know, the Sales segment consists of the trading business and the retail business. For the full year, we have got in this segment a loss. So, for the full year 2024, we have got a loss or a negative EBITDA of around €100 million, which consists of around €100 million negative coming from the retail business and a plus or minus zero from the trading business. The trading business, however, we assumed here, let's say, a negative valuation effect of around €100 million. Now in Q1, the situation was not as anticipated for the full year, so we had a positive contribution from the trading business of around 30 million and a negative contribution of the retail of around minus €20 million. So, this is the current situation. Of course, we don't know exactly how the valuation effects will develop because this is clearly dependent on the wholesale prices as of the respective, let's say, date -- valuation date. I would say in a normalized year, so let's say we would assume the retail business to go back to normal and the trading business without any valuation effects, we would assume an EBITDA between €100 million and €150 million for a full year.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Martin Tessier with Stifel. Please go ahead.

Martin Tessier: Yes. Hi. Thanks for the presentation and I hope you can hear me well. One question on the New Renewables segment. Looking at the average unit, I saw a decrease of €110 per megawatt hour, meaning from around €250 million in Q1 2023 to around €140 in Q1 2024. So the magnitude of the decline is quite impressive. So I just want to know if you could provide us with some granularity on the breakdown of the volumes regarding whether it's a feed-in tariff or corporate PPA or merchant, because the decline implies quite an important merchant exporter in this segment. And a second question, could you provide us with the hydro coefficient in April? Thank you very much.

Peter Kollmann: Yeah. I will start with the hydro coefficient in April. In April, the hydro coefficient has been 1.05. And on the first one, I don't know about the other participants on the call, but at least here at our end, the acoustics were really bad. So let me paraphrase what I think I heard. You were asking about the EBITDA decline of our New Renewable business, correct?

Martin Tessier: No. I was asking about the decline in the average selling price...

Peter Kollmann: Yes. Okay. The result is a function of a certain percentage of our New Renewables being merchant and not PPAs or CFDs. As a result of that, we had a decline given the merchant production and the average fall is from €202 per megawatt hour to €118 per megawatt hour. So what you see here is a reflection of a dramatic decrease in power prices, which we have seen across our generation. We have seen it in Spain on the solar side. Very, very significant, of course. But we have also seen it on the hydro side, which we have commented on before.

Martin Tessier: Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, could you provide us with the share of your volumes, which are considered merchant?

Peter Kollmann: Yeah. At this point in time, we don't give the exact percentage of how much we are merchant and how much is regulated.

Martin Tessier: Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Wanda Serwinowska with UBS. Please go ahead.

Wanda Serwinowska: Hi. Good morning. Wanda Serwinowska, UBS. Two and a half questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, when I compare -- basically when I compare to your guidance that you gave us in mid-March, the retail business is much better. Power price for 2024 on the mark-to-market is higher. Hydro volumes are much better and I think in the guidance, you always assume 1 for the rest of the year and it was 1.29 in Q1. So at the same time, what you did, you only raised the bottom end of the guidance. So were there any offsetting factors or are you just cautious, given that we are still early in today? I'm trying to understand what prevented you from raising the total guidance, not only the bottom end. Question number two is on the data centers, sorry, Peter. I mean, have you seen any -- I mean, have you got any inquiries to sign a long-term PPA with data centers, because in theory, hydro is one of the best technologies because you can provide base load, but have you seen any inquiries? Have you signed anything or are data centers owners willing to pay any premium? And the third question, if you could give us the latest hedging for 2024, 2025 and 2026, that would be much, much appreciated? Thank you.

Peter Kollmann: Yeah. Sure, Wanda. I will start with the current up-to-date hedging levels, then I will talk about the data centers and then we'll talk about the guidance. Now, first of all, on the hedging, per now, we are -- for 2024, we are 81% hedged at a mark-to-market level of 116. For 2025, we are 47% hedged at a mark-to-market level of 108. And for 2026, we are 33% hedged at a mark-to-market level of 79. On the data centers, in addition to what I said before, yes, data centers will have a tendency to want base load PPAs. You're right. What they need and what they want is a stability of supply for a given period of time, obviously, also with the price stability given through a PPA. That is correct and we will probably see all the build-out of the data centers over the next few years. There will definitely be participants in the PPA market, even focusing on longer-term PPAs, and I'm sure that they will basically focus on base load PPAs. Secondly, yes, you're right that we, as a green producer of base load energy, we would be perfect as a partner for those long-term base load PPAs. And yes, we had some inquiries, but nothing where I could tell you, this is the structure that would be the kind of pricing at this point in time. Once that market has evolved further, obviously, we will let you know. But yes, it is an opportunity for base load producers. And the third point on the guidance, I mean, yes, we are, I wouldn't say cautious, we are aware of the volatility, which we have in the various sectors. There is some uncertainty. Obviously, we have started with good -- with a very good hydro coefficient that has helped us. We have seen some normalization in terms of the price. We have seen gas prices going up because of a number of reasons, which you all know. We see at the moment a lot of LNG demand from Asia. That is something we discussed on our last conference call, where basically said the one thing, in my opinion, the one thing to observe is demand from Asia, because that is going to have an impact on LNG flowing into Europe. But the one thing we shouldn't forget is the reservoirs, very stable. They are -- I wouldn't say they are full, but they are much fuller than under normal circumstances. There is LNG, there is a lot of LNG coming into Europe and we are going to see over the next few years more LNG capacity being built in Europe. So I continue to think that we are going to have geopolitical impact on gas prices. However, structurally, I don't really see the gas price moving up dramatically. The CO2 price we have discussed last time, I think, not a lot has changed. And then on Austrian Power Grid, Austrian Power Grid, because of IFRS, I mean, not in our local GAAP, but because of IFRS, where we don't have a regulatory account, all the changes. So when we have less congestion management, when we have less control energy, when we have less auction results, that has an immediate impact. And therefore, at this point in the year, we think that there is quite some volatility around the APG results on the IFRS. Obviously not in the local GAAP, because there the regulatory account compensates for everything. With that, we think that we have a solid guidance by having increased the bottom part. The guidance is still relatively wide. We appreciate that. But at the same time, when we have more data points and three months down the road from today, we will obviously give you a narrow guidance and a guidance based on the new data points, which we have.

Wanda Serwinowska: Can I quickly ask two follow up? So, as I understand, you haven't signed any PPA with data centers, because you talk about the opportunities, but you haven't signed anything yet. And then on the retail, would you be able to quantify what is baked into your guidance, because in March, you, I think it was something around negative €100 million. What is baked currently into your guidance?

Peter Kollmann: Okay. First of all, on the data centers. On the data centers, we have not concluded any data center PPAs. And on the second one, you were talking about minus €100 million on the Sales segment. Did I understand you correctly?

Wanda Serwinowska: ... you mentioned minus €104 million that is baked into the guidance.

Peter Kollmann: Yeah. Yeah. As Andreas mentioned before, the minus €100 million is still valid as a result of the retail prices, the procurement prices. Overall, there is upside on that one. Yeah, is the upside going to be already relevant for 2024 or are we going to see the upside on the retail business in 2025? Remains to be seen. But that is, the minus €100 million for the segment is still valid.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Thibult Duyadin [ph] with Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Unidentified Analyst: Hello. Good morning. One question regarding the Hydro project in Spain. If you could give more info regarding the framework, CapEx and the framework associated and timelines?

Peter Kollmann: Could you -- did you -- did I understand you correctly? You were asking about the reservoirs, the pump storage?

Unidentified Analyst: No, no. Spain. Hydro project in Spain.

Peter Kollmann: Oh! The project in Spain. Okay, okay, okay. Sorry. Because we had a pretty bad line there. The -- yes, the Spanish project. Quite frankly, we, VERBUND, would not have made an announcement on this project because it's a very early stage and we feel that there are still so many variables, there are still so many ponderables which we need to work through, that it is, from our perspective, too early to make an announcement. However, we have a partner in the project, a Spanish partner, and the Spanish partner was very keen to make such an announcement. So at this point in time, what I can tell you is that Prima Vista [ph], at first sight, we feel that this could be a very interesting project. Why? Because we see that system volatility in Spain will increase. We see that baseload availability is going to be an issue. We feel that intermittency cannot be fully compensated by a new generation of battery storage on scale. As a result of that, pump storage could actually have a very important function in that market. We are experts in pump storage. As you know, we have pumps -- we have had pump storage in Austria for a very, very long time. We optimize pump storage on a daily basis, I should say on an hourly basis. So that is a technology that is highly complex, but we understand extremely well. As a result of that, we have entered this agreement and we are looking into those two projects very seriously. But they are many, many years away. There are still many approvals. There are technical challenges which we have to work through. As a result of that, it would be too early to give you more detail on that.

Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Piotr Dzieciolowski with Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Piotr Dzieciolowski: Hi. Good morning, everybody. It's Piotr from Citi. I have two questions. So, the first one is, when I look at your slides where you provide a bit of details on the Renewable portfolio, there's a CapEx figure of below a €1 billion. And then when you provide a growth CapEx by division, it's €1.7 billion. So I just wanted to understand what is the amount of money you're planning to spend on the New Renewable segment and what kind of capacity commissioning we should expect either organically or inorganically in this segment in the next three years. And the second question I have regarding your forward guidance. When I look at kind of your hedge level and power prices, it may seem that the consensus beyond 2024 is somewhat optimistic about your numbers. So I just wanted to understand how you think about €2.5 billion profitability level for the Group at the low point of the hedging. And at what point you would issue a similar announcement that you issued earlier this year, warning the market that potentially it's not in the right place or if we don't see it coming, it means that you are comfortable with the number? Thank you.

Peter Kollmann: Sure. I will start with the last one. The ad-hoc announcement which we have made was a function of two things. Number one, a more formalistic one, the Austrian regulator in that regard is probably one of the strictest in Europe. As a result of that, when we see that there is a delta between the consensus and our understanding, our internal understanding where the numbers are going to be, we have to come out immediately. Number two, we feel that the regulator has a point, because it is our style, and you know us, that whenever we feel that there is something important the market should know, we come out immediately. So we have a history over the last 10 years of having made regular ad-hoc announcements when we felt that there was an important information which we have internally, which we would like to share with the market. The second point, the ad-hoc announcement was a result of a decrease in power prices that is absolutely historic. We have never seen anything like it, and I am brave now, I think, we will probably not see anything similar in the future. The fall has been from around €140 to around €70 within a very, very short period of time. So theoretically, you could have said, well, wait a second, everybody knows our business model, everybody knows that the power price has a dramatic impact on our earnings, so why hasn't the consensus been adjusted? Well, I think because it happened so fast. And obviously, it is when you have such a dramatic fall that has such a dramatic impact on the earnings, that is something that is very unusual, it is very rare, and as a result of that, we came out with our ad-hoc announcement, which by the way, at the end of the day, did not have a dramatic impact on the share price and some of the comments from research analysts, but also from investors was, well, we had a feeling that there would have been impact anyway with the lower power prices. Now, going forward and looking into the future, at this point in time, I cannot see why we would have a dramatic delta between consensus and reality. Why? Because just before I have given the numbers for 2024, 2025 and 2026 for today, the hedging levels and the mark-to-market. Mark-to-market means that everything we have not hedged yet, we are using the future prices. The future prices are well known and that is exactly the uncertainty in terms of the impact on the earnings, on that unhedged level and the delta between today's future prices for those years, and where the development is going to be. Which one was or the next one was on the, would you like to do the Renewals, Andreas?

Andreas Wollein: Yeah. I think the CapEx in the Renewals in the next three years, 2024 to 2026, I think, we have marked around €1.8 billion into growth. This is mainly focused on, let's say, the pipeline we have in Spain, which is around a €1 billion and some other projects we have currently under development in Germany and in Italy. Yeah, so, this is growth CapEx which we spend in Renewables. I think we have also shown in the chart, in the detailed chart, where you see the map of Europe, a figure of around €2.2 billion until 2030, but this is basically related to the long-term planning to reach our target. Maybe more in the coming years, but this is currently based on, let's say, projects which are already in our portfolio and which are likely to be realized.

Operator: We have a follow-up question from Olly Jeffery with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Olly Jeffery: Thank you. So, a couple of follow-ups. Could you please just explain or just remind us the mechanics of the regulatory account, that if the regulator agrees over time to linearly reduce that account, how does that impact the IFRS numbers? I presume that results in a lower IFRS number but is non-cash. That's the first one. The second one is, you gave the hedge mark-to-market numbers, Peter, but could you please give the actual hedge number, because then we can update our power price assumptions to see where that comes out at? And then, last question, I'll be interested to see if you have a view on the current, in France, where we're seeing the interconnectors being limited at the moment and you can observe quite a large delta between the German and French power price, which normally trades relatively in line. If you think that interconnection were to be restored, do you have a view on the impact that could have on the German power price? Are EBITDA -- that delta would reduce, and therefore, you could see a flat softening in German power prices. I don't know if you have any view on that at all, but if you do, that would be great to share? Thank you very much.

Peter Kollmann: Unfortunately, I'm only a mechanical engineer and not an electric engineer. However, I will try to give you an idea on sort of like interconnector capacities and their impact on the power price. The objective of the European Union and of the European grid operators is to increase net transfer capacity. And the reason for that is that from a European perspective, the objective has been for a very long time that the delta in power prices between European countries would become much, much smaller. The reason why we have the partly high differences in power prices is because of the very reason which you have just mentioned, that we don't have enough capacity. As a result of that, we have concessions. The concessions need to be compensated for re-dispatch, re-dispatch can be very expensive. So from a system point of view, from a system stability point of view, that is exactly the reason why everybody talks about we need -- we can only have an energy transformation if we have a grid transformation. And by grid transformation, we basically mean two things, no, three things. Number one, we need to increase net transfer capacity among countries. Number two, we need to work on the grid per se. So we need to get rid of critical branches, as they are called or concessions. So we need to have a free flow of electricity across the network, preferably across Europe. And number three, and that is one thing we should not forget, we need substations. So we basically need to integrate the Renewables, we need to integrate the decentralized system into the transportation system. That requires tremendous effort, that requires a very smart approach by all the operators, that requires a lot of capital and is an absolute necessity in Europe. The impact will be that countries that have a large production of base load, like France, through their vast nuclear industry, will have a very stable production of base load. And once they're able to export more into places where you don't have enough base load, like in Germany, that would have an impact on the power price and it would basically reduce the power price. I'll give you another example. The German regulator has decided that more coal-fired power plants are required in Germany for the reserve, which is something we have discussed many times in those conference calls over the years, that we have basically said, when you get out of nuclear, when you want to get out of coal, when you don't like gas, you end up having a real base load problem. And that base load problem can partially be solved by exports from France, which is a base load producer, as mentioned before, and of course, by having enough reserves within Germany. So sorry, there was a long answer to your question, but I didn't want to shortcut it, because I would have diluted the complexity of the subject.

Andreas Wollein: Olly, just -- the hedging price -- the hedge price for 2025 is €124.6 and for 2026 it's, one second.

Peter Kollmann: It's €79.

Andreas Wollein: Yeah. €79 and for 2024 it's €126.4. So for 2024 we have €126.4, for 2025 we have €124.6 and for 2026, with only 33% hedged, it's €78.8. With regard to the regulatory account, I mean, you know how it works, basically. So let's say the regulated grid company has an allowed return and should the grid company earn more than what is regulatory allowed, then the difference is allocated to the regulatory account. So the regulatory account currently stands at €500 million, roughly. As mentioned, it's basically a product or the sum of all the over-earnings which APG has achieved over the last couple of years. Sooner or later, this amount has to be returned or given back to the system. How the regulator will do that, we don't know how quickly. So there is no schedule implemented. But should the regulator decide to reduce the regulatory account, of course this will have a negative cash effect and it will also have a negative results effect under IFRS, not under local GAAP, because here, the local -- under the local GAAP, the regulatory account can be used and can be accounted, basically.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Peter Kollmann for any closing remarks.

Peter Kollmann: Yeah. We have -- we had a very large number of participants today. I would like to thank you all for your interest, even now at the level of the quarter numbers. Thank you very much for your questions, which are all highly relevant and for the discussion, which we always very much appreciate. And I look forward to either seeing you in the meantime on roadshows or hearing you on our next conference call. All the best and thank you very much.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now over. Thank you for choosing Chorus Call and thank you for participating in the conference. You may now disconnect your lines.

-Astypalaea, Halki, Tilos and Syros pave the way for sustainable tourism, waste management and technology

Astypalaea, Halki and Tilos. You may not have heard of these small, remote Greek islands in the South Aegean, but they all share something in common: ambitious goals despite their small size.

For decades, islands like these have been considered merely remote stops on ferry routes that had to be supported by state subsidies - no business wants to operate at a loss. They were considered unprofitable compared to the big islands like Santorini and Mykonos, which attract large numbers of visitors.

Today, however, these islands are attracting global attention for their green prospects and innovation-focused initiatives. The trio is adopting a range of measures of environmental conservation, sustainability and innovation, some of which are shining examples of best practice.

Central and northern European countries, such as Austria, Finland and Denmark, have long had high scores for eco-innovation, while Greece has lagged behind. Today, the south-eastern European country is demonstrating how sustainability can be achieved and innovation implemented using smart technology, integrated systems and innovative narratives.

Greece is blessed with unparalleled natural beauty, yet over the last decade, Greece has faced a number of complex challenges related to the environment, energy, natural resources, cultural preservation, agriculture and tourism. Climate change is of particular concern, with scientists noting that the region is warming 20% faster than the global average. In May 2022, Greece passed its first climate law, which outlines specific targets to combat climate change and calls for the phasing out of the use of coal for electricity generation by 2028. Under the legislation, the authorities aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, before achieving zero net emissions by 2050.

State, regional and local authorities, with the support of the private sector, have tacitly joined forces in recent years to find solutions that strike a balance between preserving the character of islands, reducing emissions and implementing 21st century technological advances.

The three islands are joined by Rhodes and Syros, the capitals of the Dodecanese and Cyclades respectively. Together, they play a key role in shaping the future of the South Aegean and Greece as a whole. These islands create a blueprint that can be shared with the rest of the country and possibly with other countries.

These initiatives are not only aimed at improving the quality of life of local residents, but these islands will certainly prove to be particularly attractive to eco-minded travellers, who are increasingly choosing destinations based on sustainability factors.

Astypalaia: A pioneer in smart technology and green energy

The butterfly-shaped island of Astypalea in the Dodecanese, with an area of 97 square kilometres and 1,334 inhabitants, is taking important steps to become the first smart and sustainable island in the Mediterranean.

A public-private partnership involving the Greek state, the South Aegean Region and the Volkswagen Group, supported by EU funding, is implementing a pioneering project to transform the island into a model for e-mobility, smart mobility and renewable energy.

Four pillars are at the heart of this green energy-focused initiative, namely vehicle electrification, smart mobility, charging and energy and autonomous driving.

Since its launch in 2020, measures taken include the upgrading of the island's energy network and infrastructure, the installation of free public charging stations for electric vehicles and the introduction of e-mobility services. Residents can apply for subsidies for the purchase of an electric vehicle.

The introduction of on-demand buses and car-sharing services has proved to be very successful. Through the Astybus mobile app, residents and visitors can call an e-bus, which is gradually replacing conventional municipal buses, to pick them up from a virtual bus stop. In its first 150 days of operation, AstyBus made 24,370 trips. If you prefer your own means of transport, the AstyMove app allows you to book and pick up an e-car, e-bike or e-scooter for personal use.

At the same time, local authorities hope that by 2026, a hybrid energy system consisting of a photovoltaic station and batteries will cover 80% of the island's total energy needs.

Halki

A model for net zero carbon emissions on the west coast of Rhodes, the hilly Halki bears the title of Greece's first eco-island. Launched in 2021, the national initiative revolves around a circular economy initiative focused on decarbonisation and the transition to green energy. The key objectives are to increase the use of renewable energy sources, sustainable water and waste management, the introduction of e-mobility and the transformation of the agricultural and tourism sectors into ""green"" sectors. What is particularly impressive is that, through the GR-eco islands programme, the island is one of the few places in the whole world that have achieved a zero carbon footprint. That is, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is offset by an equivalent amount. This is not only a critical step forward for the region, but also a bold challenge for the country and the world at large.

A 1MW photovoltaic power plant has been installed in Halki, allowing virtual net metering and offsetting of energy costs for residents and businesses, who are part of an energy community. Many have seen significant reductions in their electricity bills and some have even received credits.

Smart street and architectural lighting, electric vehicles and mobile device charging through a smart counter are among the aspects of the program. Residents are offered incentives to replace conventional vehicles with electric ones and have access to telemedicine services.

Halki is an example of what can be achieved when local communities and the private sector work together to find solutions to critical issues through the adoption of new technologies and low-carbon energy applications.

Tilos: certified for zero waste

With an area of just 63 square metres, the pristine Tilos may be tiny, but the rocky island of the Dodecanese is leading the way in the region by adopting a circular economy mentality. In July 2023, it was declared the first island in the world with zero waste certification. In just two years, Tilos has reduced its landfill disposal rate from 87% to zero.

Just Go Zero Tilos, a pioneering integrated waste management programme, was launched in December 2021 and includes the closure of the island's landfill. The programme is being implemented by the Municipality of Tilos in collaboration with Polygreen and the South Aegean Region, with the aim of making the island waste-free.

Through the programme, all waste is collected and, based on the principles of the circular economy, reused in order to eliminate its environmental footprint. Residents and business owners sort their waste into bins which are collected from their doorstep on specific days and taken to the Centre for Circular Innovation. There, recyclables are separated and packaged and non-recyclables are sent for waste-to-energy conversion. Organic waste is converted into fertilizer.

Locals can even track recycling efforts through a mobile phone app. Visitors are also required to follow the rules. They are provided with instructions on how to sort their waste. Old clothes, appliances and furniture find new life at the Creative Recycling Center.

The island's 780 inhabitants have achieved an astonishing 90% waste recycling rate, more than double the EU average of around 40%. According to the South Aegean Region, Tilos has the highest recycling rate of any municipality in the world. Tilos aims to produce 20% less waste, use 30% less plastic and recover 90% more waste by 2025. The pilot system is complemented by a hybrid solar and wind power generation system, with energy storage in batteries, which meets the needs of the port city of Livadia, home to around 500 people.

Polygreen was so successful in Tilos that it is now implementing a similar programme in Abu Dhabi.

Rhodes: paving the way for sustainable tourism

The rapid growth of the Greek tourism industry over the last decade has led to issues such as overcrowding in popular destinations and locations and pressure on public infrastructure. Fully aware of these challenges, the South Aegean Region has taken the initiative to research, design and implement measures to make sustainable tourism a present-day reality rather than a distant utopia.

In early 2022, the region signed a strategic partnership agreement with leading tour operator TUI and the TUI Care Foundation to create The Rhodes Co-Lab. The aim was to bring together tourism industry stakeholders to find solutions and create a holistic sustainable business model for travel destinations worldwide. Its three main pillars focus on regenerating the natural environment, enhancing social development and cultural heritage and promoting inclusive economic growth in tourism. Within these pillars there are six strategic priorities and 26 measures aimed at making Rhodes climate neutral in 2030, 20 years ahead of the national target.

A comprehensive, progressive plan designed to focus on green growth and address vital issues such as quality of life, infrastructure development, biodiversity restoration, social cohesion and prosperity is already underway. Among the initial priorities, which will be supported with European and national funding, are reforestation, pollution reduction and the introduction of environmental education programmes for children. The key to a favourable outcome is the active involvement of the community in the consultations. Plans include the creation of an international centre for sustainable tourism development, whose main role will be to create and implement best practices and policies for sustainable tourism worldwide.

Syros: creating a new technology and innovation hub

In January 2023, Syros welcomed the Aegean Neorion Innovation Centre (ANIC), a collaboration between the South Aegean Region, Onex Group & Technologies, Cisco and the University of the Aegean. The centre was created for several reasons: primarily to research, design and implement innovative solutions to the challenges faced by local communities. ANIC is a dynamic, modern technology and innovation ecosystem, whose aim is to act as a key hub for the development of value-added technological solutions at regional and national level.

It was established to provide local businesses with innovative solutions and help them in their digital transformation, while bringing new technologies to areas such as education, health and the environment.

ANIC's first project involved the transformation of Syros General Hospital into a safe, green and smart facility. Tablets and mobile phones have eliminated the use of forms, while sensors track the number of visitors and prevent overcrowding. Smart meters monitor environmental parameters and help reduce energy consumption.

Tilos, Halki and Astypalaia are at the forefront of Greece's efforts towards sustainability and innovation and are proof that small can certainly be powerful. At the same time, Rhodes and Syros are becoming incubators and think tanks for sustainable tourism and technology, respectively, whose impact could well be global.

Contact with visitors from near and distant shores over the centuries has meant that islanders have always been receptive to change, progress and development. This open-minded spirit and willingness to adapt potentially points to a very bright future for the South Aegean and Greece as a whole.",money-tourism.gr,news,ΧΡΗΜΑ & ΤΟΥΡΙΣΜΟΣ money-tourism.gr,,0.388235294117647,452950074,3,https://money-tourism.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/N-AIGAIO-XT-311_02.jpg,

Andreas Wollein - Head, Group Finance and IR

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Conference Call on the Quarter One 2024 Results of VERBUND AG. I am Vasilios, the Chorus Call Operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. I would like to remind you that the presentation will be followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]

The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Peter Kollmann. Please go ahead.

Peter Kollmann

Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to the presentation of VERBUND for the first quarter 2024. And let me thank you for joining today's conference call. Before we move into the analysis of the business development of VERBUND, let me make a few general comments.

VERBUND can look back on an extremely successful year 2023 with the best result in the company's history and is starting the year 2024 as a strong, resilient and well-positioned company. However, the energy industry value drivers relevant to VERBUND's earnings have deteriorated compared to the highs of 2022 and 2023. Thus, VERBUND earnings declined slightly in the first quarter.

The fall in gas prices with its consequences on electricity wholesale prices is due in particular to the lower demand for gas as a result of the mild winter and the rather weak economy in Europe, as well as the comparatively high filling level of gas storage facilities.

Now, despite the changed framework conditions in the energy industry, we're working consistently on the implementation of our Sustainable Strategy 2030, which focuses on strengthening our integrated position in the market, the expansion of New Renewable Energy generation in Europe and the development of a green hydrogen economy.

Now, before I continue with the Q1 presentation, let me state that the interim report for the first quarter differs slightly from previously published interim reports due to a comprehensive change in the Group-wide platform for data processing and the preparation of management information.

Now, let's move on to the financial details of the first quarter 2024. At the beginning, let me highlight the most important influencing factors for the results development. Based on our hedging strategy for our own electricity generation from hydropower, the average achieved contract price decreased by €84.7 to €118.1 per megawatt hour in the first quarter.

The hydro coefficient determining the generation from run-of-river hydropower plants was very strong with 1.29 compared to last year and far above the long-term average. However, production from our hydro reservoirs was lowered by 4.8%.

Generation from wind and PV was up compared to last year, mainly driven by the commissioning of new power plant capacity in Spain. Thermal generation also increased due to the increased use of our Mellach CCGT.

The Sales segment also contributed positively, among others, due to lower procurement costs for energy. Contributions from the Grid segment decreased, mainly coming from lower results of Gas Connect Austria. The same applies to All Other segments whose contributions also decreased, mainly because of negative measurement effects. The contribution from flexibility products was lower, mainly due to a decrease in congestion management and control energy.

Finally, a minor negative impact on our results was coming from the levy on excess profits in Spain. There were no impacts in the other countries of operations in the first quarter from levies on excess profits.

The impact of these influencing factors on the key figures of VERBUND are as follows. EBITDA decreased by 8.7% to €883 million and the Group result decreased by 4.3% to €506 million. The operating cash flow also decreased to a level of €929 million. The free cash flow after dividends was positive at a level of €675 million and net debt improved by 35.8% to a level of €1.129 million.

Let me now give you our updated guidance for 2024. Based on average hydro, wind and PV generation in the quarters two to four, as well as the actual opportunities and risk situation of the Group, VERBUND expects a reported and adjusted EBITDA between approximately €2.8 billion and €3.3 billion, and a reported Group result between approximately €1.45 billion to €1.75 billion in 2024. The payout ratio will be between 45% and 55% of the adjusted Group result between approximately €1.45 billion and €1.75 billion.

Now on the next page, let me start with the hedging volumes and hedging prices. As you know, highly relevant to VERBUND results, you know that €1 plus or minus has a sensitivity of approximately €25 million on the EBITDA line.

As of the 31st of March, 2024, we reached an average achieved contract price for our hydro generation of €129.5 for 2024 and we had sold approximately 77%, for 2025, we had sold 45% of our own generation at a price of €126.6 and for 2026, we had sold 32% of the generation volumes at €79.4.

On a mark-to-market basis, with prices as of the 16th of April, 2024, the average achieved contract price for 2024 is at €118.7 per megawatt hour, for 2025, it is at €112.4 per megawatt hour and for 2026 it is at €82.7 per megawatt hour.

Now on the next page, let me comment on some developments in the various business segments of VERBUND and let me start with the Hydro segment. At €1.29, the hydro coefficient, as you know, that's our index quantifying the hydropower generation of the run-of-river power plants, was an impressive 29 percentage points above the long-term average and 36 percentage points above the level of the first quarter 2023.

The production from annual storage power plants decreased by 4.8%. Own production from hydropower therefore overall increased by 1.8 terawatt hours or 29.6% to 7.893 terawatt hours compared to the first quarter 2023.

Lower average achieved prices, however, could not be compensated by the increase in volume and are the main reason for the decrease in EBITDA in the Hydro segment. In addition, flexibility products decreased by €17.8 million. In total, EBITDA in the Hydro segment decreased by 18% to €714.4 million.

Regarding CapEx, our main hydro project, the 480-megawatt Limberg III pump storage power plant and the 45-megawatt Reißeck II pump storage power plants are progressing well. The 11-megawatt run-of-river project Gratkorn as well and the COD is expected in 2024.

Now let me continue with the analysis of the own generation from New Renewables. The New Renewables coefficient, that is an index quantifying the generation from wind power and PV, amounted to 0.89 in the first quarter 2024, compared to 1.03 in the first quarter 2023. The generation for wind power nevertheless increased by 65.6%, up 221 gigawatt hours and amounted to 558 gigawatt hours in the first quarter. New installations in Spain and Austria more than compensated for less favorable wind conditions. Generation from PV amounted to 77 gigawatt hours in the reporting period, stemming mainly from PV installations in Spain.

Now, taking a look at the EBITDA development in the New Renewables segment, we see that the EBITDA decreased by 6% to an EBITDA amounting to €56.7 million. Although volumes increased due to the acquisition of wind power installations in Spain and in Austria, lower average achieved prices led to a slight decrease in EBITDA. The chart also provides an overview on current developments in the renewables segment.

On the next slide, you will find an update of our renewable activities. The chart outlines our New Renewable assets in operation and construction in our market split by technology, as well as our targets for 2030.

With that, I would like to hand over to Andreas Wollein, who is going to take us through the Sales segment, the other segments and will continue with the key figures. Please, Andreas.

Andreas Wollein

Yeah. Thank you, Peter. So, on Slide 6, you see the development of the Sales segment in the first quarter. So, the EBITDA development in the Sales segment increased strongly to a slight positive value of €6.8 million after minus €103.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in EBITDA is mainly due to lower procurement prices for electricity and gas. However, lower earnings contributions from flexibility products had an opposite and opposing effect. Flexibility products decreased by around €8 million. For both delivered electricity and gas to approximately 586,000 end customers in Q1 2024.

Moving on to the next slide, you see the development in All Other segments. So, generation from our thermal power plants was up by about 6.7% to 328 gigawatt hours due to the increased use of the CCGT Mellach for electricity and district heating production. The decline in EBITDA is mainly due to negative effects from the evaluation of energy derivatives in connection with future energy supplies.

The contribution from our participation in Kelag, the provincial utility of Carinthia, increased from €14 million to around €21 million due to a better hydro situation, as well as higher contributions from the trading and heating business. Finally, let me remind you that Mellach is no longer contracted for future congestion management. So, both lines are operated in a market -- on a market driven basis at least until April 1, 2025.

The next slide shows the development in our important regulated Grid segment. So, as you know, the Grid segment consists of the regulated business Austrian Power Grid, as well as Gas Connect Austria.

The EBITDA for Q1 2024 from the Grid business according to IFRS was approximately €85 million and therefore more or less equal to last year. EBITDA guidance for the electricity grid for 2024 was increased from approximately €220 million to €235 million. The reasons for the increased guidance are lower procurement costs for control energy and lower congestion management procurement counterbalanced by lower revenues from the yearly auctions.

The planned amount of the regulatory account at the end of 2024 will only slightly increase to a level of approximately €515 million. Let me also remind you that starting from January 1, 2024 a new regulatory period has started. APG receives a weighted average cost of capital of 4.16% for old assets with a commissioning date up to 2022. Weighted average cost of capital of 4.88% for new assets with a commissioning date in 2023 and a WACC of 6.33% for new assets with a commissioning date in 2024. So the total WACC for 2024 is approximately 4.5%.

With regard to the result contribution of Gas Connect Austria we report an EBITDA of approximately €26 million in the first quarter 2024. The main reason for the decrease are lower transmission revenues particularly from the commodity tariff. The guidance for 2024 increased from approximately €60 million to approximately €75 million because of lower procurement costs for gas.

On the next slide you see the key financial figures. So I think Pete already outlined the development of the EBITDA so it was up by €84 million -- it decreased, sorry, by €84 million to 8.7% to €883 million. Depreciation increased by 10% to €138.6 million due to the acquisition of Spanish assets and increased investments into the high voltage grid.

The financial result improved to €16.6 million. This was attributable to higher earnings contributions from interest accounted for using the equity method mainly Kelag, higher interest income and lower interest expenses mainly caused by the repayment of a Schuldscheindarlehen in November 2023 and the amount of around €500 million, as well as lower interest expenses from money market transactions. So taxes and income decreased to an amount of €175 million. The Group result therefore decreased by €22.9 million or 4.3% to €506 million.

Yeah. Moving on to the next slide, we see the development of the cash flows and the gearing situation. So, VERBUND operating cash flow in the first quarter decreased to €929 million, mainly due to a lower average price achieved for electricity, as well as lower return flows from the margining payments for hedging transactions in the electricity business which were deposited with the gearing house of the electricity exchange as collateral for open trading positions. In addition, higher income tax payments contributed negatively.

The free cash flow after dividends showed a negative development, but it's still very attractive at the level of plus €675 million. The lower operating cash flow and high investments in property, plant and equipment were the reasons for this development.

Net debt decreased again from €1.758 billion at the end of 2023 to €1.129 billion at the end of the first quarter 2024 due to the positive free cash flow. Gearing correspondingly decreased to a level of 9.4%, compared to 15.7% at year-end 2023.

So now we are coming to the last slide, the outlook and I will hand over again to Peter.

Peter Kollmann

Thank you. Andreas. Yeah. On our earnings outlook 2024, I would like to give you both the outlook and our sensitivities. Now on the sensitivities the deviation of plus minus 1% in the generation from hydropower has an impact of plus minus €8.9 million in the Group result for the whole year, a deviation of plus minus 1% in the generation from wind power and PV has an impact of €0.8 million and a deviation of plus minus €1 in the wholesale price has an impact of €4 million in the Group result for 2024.

Our guidance as I mentioned before for 2024 is as follows. We expect a reported and adjusted EBITDA of between €2.8 billion to €3.3 billion and a reported Group result of between €1.45 billion and €1.75 billion under the assumption of average hydro, average wind and PV generation in the quarters two to four, as well as the chances and risk situation of the entire group.

For the financial year 2024 we are planning to pay out between 45% and 55% of the Group result after our adjustment for non-recurring effects on the results of €1.45 billion and €1.75 billion.

Now, with that, I would like to move on to our Q&A, please?

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Campbell with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

John Campbell

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. We look at Fortum, one of your peers and they actually happen to provide some guidance on their expected optimization premium. They actually quote a figure of about €6 per megawatt hour to €8 per megawatt hour that they can achieve over wholesale prices. Is this something that VERBUND is likely to offer in the future? And would you say actually as you sit here now that a €6 to €8 premium is something that VERBUND could achieve? And so that was my first question. And then I was also interested on the topic of APG. So, could you clarify where you see the movement in the regulatory account going to, was it €515 million? And then any comments you can give on allowed returns for 2025 assets would be helpful. Thank you.

Peter Kollmann

Yeah. Sure. The first one is an interesting one on the -- I think you called it the optimization premium. We have heard similar points, similar discussions around how can you achieve a higher contract price above sort of like the wholesale price that is given by the market and the definitions vary.

When you look at the flexibility products and when you look at congestion management, control energy, intraday trading, pumping and turbining in a way that is an optimization, because what you do is, you use your power generation in order to create a premium to what would under normal circumstances be the normal price.

So in a way you could basically take our flexibility products, you could then, of course, take the optimization from our reservoirs and you could say, and that comes in addition to our quote-unquote normal generation.

We don't call it optimization. We are -- we very simply say, this is what we make out of selling our generation. This is how much we make in our flexibility products and that is some sort of an optimization.

On the second one, Austrian Power Grid, yes, you're right, the regulatory account is high at €515 million. We feel that we should reduce it simply because we want to have a more linear development in the future in terms of the regulatory account.

You might remember that already two years ago we said that we are discussing with the regulator to take an approach where every year we reduce the regulatory account. The reduction of the regulatory account of course would mean that the tariff would get reduced, which for the system is a good thing.

So far the regulator has decided to keep the regulatory account the way it is. So this is something where we will hopefully over the next few years see a reduction and not an increase in the regulatory account.

Andreas Wollein

John, the return on the investments. So, for 2024, as outlined, we will get for all the investments 6.33%. For 2025 this is open. You know that the regulator or the regulatory system has changed in a way that the regulator will now adjust the risk-free rate every year. So I would say in September, October this year when the grid company receives the cost decree for the coming year the WACC will be set for 2025, but the current expectation is that it will roughly be the same number for 2025. And these numbers -- these returns for each year will then be fixed until the end of the regulatory period.

The next question comes from the line of Olly Jeffery with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Olly Jeffery

Thank you very much. Good morning. My first question please is on the snowpack level in Austria. I've heard a few different things on this regarding the snowpack level currently compared to seasonal norms and what that might mean to your ability to refill reservoir levels and what that could mean for hydro coefficient for the rest of the year. So is the snowpack level at the moment above norm in line or below? And the second question I have please is on Gas Connect Austria. I believe you were in discussions with the regulator very recently discussing a new business model taking effect from 2025 onwards. Could you please update on the outcome from that and what that might mean for EBITDA from that business going forward from 2025? Thank you very much.

Peter Kollmann

Yeah. Yeah. Surely. I will start with Gas Connect Austria and then talk about the snowpack, the skiing slopes in Austria which you mentioned as your first question. The -- on Gas Connect Austria we don't have a result. We are in the midst of discussions, I should say negotiations with e-control, with the regulator.

Obviously, we argue forcefully that the business model of Gas Connect Austria has changed dramatically as a result of the war and as a result of a dramatic decrease in capacity going through our pipelines.

We are -- as a result of that, we must, that's not an optionality, we must go from the old regulatory system to a new regulatory system which is a cost plus system, in a way similar to what we have at APG, Austrian Power Grid.

We will see what the result is going to be, but there is downside potential. So from an EBITDA development, and I cannot give you a number, I can only give you a trend, we feel that the trend for the future in Gas Connect Austria could be sloping rather down than up.

In terms of your first question, yes, you're right. We had an interesting situation where, first of all, everybody, including our sort of like hydrology experts were surprised about the very high levels of our hydro coefficient in the first quarter.

You're right, the result was a combination of different things. Number one, we had snow. Then we had warm weather. The snow, obviously, in the form of water, came down. It increased the hydro coefficient quite dramatically. At the same time, at the lower levels, we had a lot of rain. At the very high levels in the mountains, there is still snow and that snow eventually will come down as well.

You are asking yourself, and you're not the only one, what does it mean for the rest of the year? Does it mean that we are going to have a higher than normal hydro coefficient for 2024? The answer is, we don't know.

I mean, we could have a very good start, followed by a very dry third quarter and a very dry fourth quarter. I mean, we have seen it before. And as a result of that, it could well be that the hydro coefficient at the end of 2024 is going to be somewhere around 1.

I mean, obviously, we are happy that we had a good start. That's a good thing. And as I mentioned in my presentation before, we were able to compensate the lower power prices with higher generation, with more volume. That's a good thing and that helped us. But at the end of the day, the weather is close to impossible to predict. Olly, would that be a response that explains your question on the hydro situation?

Olly Jeffery

Yeah. It's helpful. But just one follow-up on it. I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts. But would you say that the current level of snowpack in the Alps means that it should be easier than normal for you to refill the reservoirs, assuming normal rain during the summer or is it quite difficult to tell because of the height at which the snow is, and therefore, you can't really give a view?

Peter Kollmann

Well, it's difficult to tell. I always have an opinion, as you know. If I gave you the correct answer from a purely theoretical point of view, it is close to impossible to make a prediction. However, if you wanted to get a personal opinion, we have in the higher levels of the mountains, we have snowpacks that are relatively close to what we have seen in the last few years. And as a result of that, it should be, in terms of water coming down, both into the reservoirs and into the rivers, it should be not dramatically different from previous years.

The next question comes from the line of Harrison Williams with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Harrison Williams

Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two from me, please. Firstly, on the Sales division, clearly pleasing to see that return to profitability. And it'd be useful just to hear your expectations on that for the year and then what a maybe more normalized run rate would be for that on an annual basis going forward. So that's the first. And then on the second, we are hearing a lot of interest about data center demand growth on the power side. Is that something you see as kind of relevant for VERBUND at present or going forward? Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.

Peter Kollmann

Okay. I'll talk about data centers, and Andreas will talk about the Sales segment. On data centers, I mean, almost everybody on this call has followed a number of trends over the last few years that were widely discussed.

We talked a lot about e-mobility. We talked a lot about hydrogen. In fact, hydrogen was probably the biggest trend in terms of a discussion around not just the European energy transformation, but the global energy transformation and now data centers.

The one thing, I mean, let's differentiate between sort of like what is a given and what is an uncertainty. As far as I'm concerned, and I'm not a data center specialist, but as far as I'm concerned, the build-out of data centers to me is a reality, because it is a function of AI using way more energy than previous technologies, which is logical if you consider how much information has to be collected by AI and every piece of data collection requires electricity. As a result of that, with AI, the demand for electricity will go up. That is a certainty.

The one thing that to me is not certain at all is two things. Number one, what is the distribution of data centers? I don't think the data centers are going to be built where you have a lot of uncertainty because -- uncertainty of supply, because data centers need very, very stable generation.

Yeah, as a result of that, you can either have a combination of intermittent power generation combined with battery storage in order to create synthetic baseload or you have data centers where you have a lot of baseload generation, like in some parts of Scandinavia, for example.

And then, of course, when you look at the location, you need to look at the data connections. Are the data connections stable enough and are they powerful enough to transport all the data that is required? That is around the location.

The next point would be when you consider that there will be a rational and logical approach to where you build the data centers and what the capacity of the data centers is going to be, it will probably be at locations where the impact is going to be manageable. Everything else would be irrational in terms of the planning.

As a result of that, we might, and I'm not sure, but we might overestimate the impact of data centers on the electricity price. So, that is all I can say at this point in time, but I obviously appreciate and fully understand the questions around data centers. With that, I would like to hand over to Andreas to talk about the Sales segment.

Andreas Wollein

Yeah. So, as you know, the Sales segment consists of the trading business and the retail business. For the full year, we have got in this segment a loss. So, for the full year 2024, we have got a loss or a negative EBITDA of around €100 million, which consists of around €100 million negative coming from the retail business and a plus or minus zero from the trading business.

The trading business, however, we assumed here, let's say, a negative valuation effect of around €100 million. Now in Q1, the situation was not as anticipated for the full year, so we had a positive contribution from the trading business of around 30 million and a negative contribution of the retail of around minus €20 million.

So, this is the current situation. Of course, we don't know exactly how the valuation effects will develop because this is clearly dependent on the wholesale prices as of the respective, let's say, date -- valuation date. I would say in a normalized year, so let's say we would assume the retail business to go back to normal and the trading business without any valuation effects, we would assume an EBITDA between €100 million and €150 million for a full year.

The next question comes from the line of Martin Tessier with Stifel. Please go ahead.

Martin Tessier

Yes. Hi. Thanks for the presentation and I hope you can hear me well. One question on the New Renewables segment. Looking at the average unit, I saw a decrease of €110 per megawatt hour, meaning from around €250 million in Q1 2023 to around €140 in Q1 2024. So the magnitude of the decline is quite impressive. So I just want to know if you could provide us with some granularity on the breakdown of the volumes regarding whether it's a feed-in tariff or corporate PPA or merchant, because the decline implies quite an important merchant exporter in this segment. And a second question, could you provide us with the hydro coefficient in April? Thank you very much.

Peter Kollmann

Yeah. I will start with the hydro coefficient in April. In April, the hydro coefficient has been 1.05. And on the first one, I don't know about the other participants on the call, but at least here at our end, the acoustics were really bad. So let me paraphrase what I think I heard. You were asking about the EBITDA decline of our New Renewable business, correct?

Martin Tessier

No. I was asking about the decline in the average selling price...

Yes. Okay. The result is a function of a certain percentage of our New Renewables being merchant and not PPAs or CFDs. As a result of that, we had a decline given the merchant production and the average fall is from €202 per megawatt hour to €118 per megawatt hour.

So what you see here is a reflection of a dramatic decrease in power prices, which we have seen across our generation. We have seen it in Spain on the solar side. Very, very significant, of course. But we have also seen it on the hydro side, which we have commented on before.

Martin Tessier

Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, could you provide us with the share of your volumes, which are considered merchant?

Peter Kollmann

Yeah. At this point in time, we don't give the exact percentage of how much we are merchant and how much is regulated.

The next question comes from the line of Wanda Serwinowska with UBS. Please go ahead.

Wanda Serwinowska

Hi. Good morning. Wanda Serwinowska, UBS. Two and a half questions for me. The first one is on your 2024 guidance. I mean, when I compare -- basically when I compare to your guidance that you gave us in mid-March, the retail business is much better. Power price for 2024 on the mark-to-market is higher. Hydro volumes are much better and I think in the guidance, you always assume 1 for the rest of the year and it was 1.29 in Q1. So at the same time, what you did, you only raised the bottom end of the guidance. So were there any offsetting factors or are you just cautious, given that we are still early in today? I'm trying to understand what prevented you from raising the total guidance, not only the bottom end. Question number two is on the data centers, sorry, Peter. I mean, have you seen any -- I mean, have you got any inquiries to sign a long-term PPA with data centers, because in theory, hydro is one of the best technologies because you can provide base load, but have you seen any inquiries? Have you signed anything or are data centers owners willing to pay any premium? And the third question, if you could give us the latest hedging for 2024, 2025 and 2026, that would be much, much appreciated? Thank you.

Peter Kollmann

Yeah. Sure, Wanda. I will start with the current up-to-date hedging levels, then I will talk about the data centers and then we'll talk about the guidance. Now, first of all, on the hedging, per now, we are -- for 2024, we are 81% hedged at a mark-to-market level of 116. For 2025, we are 47% hedged at a mark-to-market level of 108. And for 2026, we are 33% hedged at a mark-to-market level of 79.

On the data centers, in addition to what I said before, yes, data centers will have a tendency to want base load PPAs. You're right. What they need and what they want is a stability of supply for a given period of time, obviously, also with the price stability given through a PPA. That is correct and we will probably see all the build-out of the data centers over the next few years. There will definitely be participants in the PPA market, even focusing on longer-term PPAs, and I'm sure that they will basically focus on base load PPAs.

Secondly, yes, you're right that we, as a green producer of base load energy, we would be perfect as a partner for those long-term base load PPAs. And yes, we had some inquiries, but nothing where I could tell you, this is the structure that would be the kind of pricing at this point in time. Once that market has evolved further, obviously, we will let you know. But yes, it is an opportunity for base load producers.

And the third point on the guidance, I mean, yes, we are, I wouldn't say cautious, we are aware of the volatility, which we have in the various sectors. There is some uncertainty. Obviously, we have started with good -- with a very good hydro coefficient that has helped us.

We have seen some normalization in terms of the price. We have seen gas prices going up because of a number of reasons, which you all know. We see at the moment a lot of LNG demand from Asia. That is something we discussed on our last conference call, where basically said the one thing, in my opinion, the one thing to observe is demand from Asia, because that is going to have an impact on LNG flowing into Europe.

But the one thing we shouldn't forget is the reservoirs, very stable. They are -- I wouldn't say they are full, but they are much fuller than under normal circumstances. There is LNG, there is a lot of LNG coming into Europe and we are going to see over the next few years more LNG capacity being built in Europe.

So I continue to think that we are going to have geopolitical impact on gas prices. However, structurally, I don't really see the gas price moving up dramatically. The CO2 price we have discussed last time, I think, not a lot has changed.

And then on Austrian Power Grid, Austrian Power Grid, because of IFRS, I mean, not in our local GAAP, but because of IFRS, where we don't have a regulatory account, all the changes. So when we have less congestion management, when we have less control energy, when we have less auction results, that has an immediate impact.

And therefore, at this point in the year, we think that there is quite some volatility around the APG results on the IFRS. Obviously not in the local GAAP, because there the regulatory account compensates for everything.

With that, we think that we have a solid guidance by having increased the bottom part. The guidance is still relatively wide. We appreciate that. But at the same time, when we have more data points and three months down the road from today, we will obviously give you a narrow guidance and a guidance based on the new data points, which we have.

Wanda Serwinowska

Can I quickly ask two follow up? So, as I understand, you haven't signed any PPA with data centers, because you talk about the opportunities, but you haven't signed anything yet. And then on the retail, would you be able to quantify what is baked into your guidance, because in March, you, I think it was something around negative €100 million. What is baked currently into your guidance?

Peter Kollmann

Okay. First of all, on the data centers. On the data centers, we have not concluded any data center PPAs. And on the second one, you were talking about minus €100 million on the Sales segment. Did I understand you correctly?

... you mentioned minus €104 million that is baked into the guidance.

Peter Kollmann

Yeah. Yeah. As Andreas mentioned before, the minus €100 million is still valid as a result of the retail prices, the procurement prices. Overall, there is upside on that one. Yeah, is the upside going to be already relevant for 2024 or are we going to see the upside on the retail business in 2025? Remains to be seen. But that is, the minus €100 million for the segment is still valid.

The next question comes from the line of Thibult Duyadin [ph] with Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Unidentified Analyst

Hello. Good morning. One question regarding the Hydro project in Spain. If you could give more info regarding the framework, CapEx and the framework associated and timelines?

Peter Kollmann

Could you -- did you -- did I understand you correctly? You were asking about the reservoirs, the pump storage?

Oh! The project in Spain. Okay, okay, okay. Sorry. Because we had a pretty bad line there. The -- yes, the Spanish project. Quite frankly, we, VERBUND, would not have made an announcement on this project because it's a very early stage and we feel that there are still so many variables, there are still so many ponderables which we need to work through, that it is, from our perspective, too early to make an announcement. However, we have a partner in the project, a Spanish partner, and the Spanish partner was very keen to make such an announcement.

So at this point in time, what I can tell you is that Prima Vista [ph], at first sight, we feel that this could be a very interesting project. Why? Because we see that system volatility in Spain will increase. We see that baseload availability is going to be an issue. We feel that intermittency cannot be fully compensated by a new generation of battery storage on scale. As a result of that, pump storage could actually have a very important function in that market.

We are experts in pump storage. As you know, we have pumps -- we have had pump storage in Austria for a very, very long time. We optimize pump storage on a daily basis, I should say on an hourly basis. So that is a technology that is highly complex, but we understand extremely well. As a result of that, we have entered this agreement and we are looking into those two projects very seriously. But they are many, many years away. There are still many approvals. There are technical challenges which we have to work through. As a result of that, it would be too early to give you more detail on that.

The next question comes from the line of Piotr Dzieciolowski with Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Piotr Dzieciolowski

Hi. Good morning, everybody. It's Piotr from Citi. I have two questions. So, the first one is, when I look at your slides where you provide a bit of details on the Renewable portfolio, there's a CapEx figure of below a €1 billion. And then when you provide a growth CapEx by division, it's €1.7 billion. So I just wanted to understand what is the amount of money you're planning to spend on the New Renewable segment and what kind of capacity commissioning we should expect either organically or inorganically in this segment in the next three years. And the second question I have regarding your forward guidance. When I look at kind of your hedge level and power prices, it may seem that the consensus beyond 2024 is somewhat optimistic about your numbers. So I just wanted to understand how you think about €2.5 billion profitability level for the Group at the low point of the hedging. And at what point you would issue a similar announcement that you issued earlier this year, warning the market that potentially it's not in the right place or if we don't see it coming, it means that you are comfortable with the number? Thank you.

Peter Kollmann

Sure. I will start with the last one. The ad-hoc announcement which we have made was a function of two things. Number one, a more formalistic one, the Austrian regulator in that regard is probably one of the strictest in Europe. As a result of that, when we see that there is a delta between the consensus and our understanding, our internal understanding where the numbers are going to be, we have to come out immediately.

Number two, we feel that the regulator has a point, because it is our style, and you know us, that whenever we feel that there is something important the market should know, we come out immediately. So we have a history over the last 10 years of having made regular ad-hoc announcements when we felt that there was an important information which we have internally, which we would like to share with the market.

The second point, the ad-hoc announcement was a result of a decrease in power prices that is absolutely historic. We have never seen anything like it, and I am brave now, I think, we will probably not see anything similar in the future. The fall has been from around €140 to around €70 within a very, very short period of time. So theoretically, you could have said, well, wait a second, everybody knows our business model, everybody knows that the power price has a dramatic impact on our earnings, so why hasn't the consensus been adjusted? Well, I think because it happened so fast.

And obviously, it is when you have such a dramatic fall that has such a dramatic impact on the earnings, that is something that is very unusual, it is very rare, and as a result of that, we came out with our ad-hoc announcement, which by the way, at the end of the day, did not have a dramatic impact on the share price and some of the comments from research analysts, but also from investors was, well, we had a feeling that there would have been impact anyway with the lower power prices.

Now, going forward and looking into the future, at this point in time, I cannot see why we would have a dramatic delta between consensus and reality. Why? Because just before I have given the numbers for 2024, 2025 and 2026 for today, the hedging levels and the mark-to-market. Mark-to-market means that everything we have not hedged yet, we are using the future prices. The future prices are well known and that is exactly the uncertainty in terms of the impact on the earnings, on that unhedged level and the delta between today's future prices for those years, and where the development is going to be. Which one was or the next one was on the, would you like to do the Renewals, Andreas?

Andreas Wollein

Yeah. I think the CapEx in the Renewals in the next three years, 2024 to 2026, I think, we have marked around €1.8 billion into growth. This is mainly focused on, let's say, the pipeline we have in Spain, which is around a €1 billion and some other projects we have currently under development in Germany and in Italy.

Yeah, so, this is growth CapEx which we spend in Renewables. I think we have also shown in the chart, in the detailed chart, where you see the map of Europe, a figure of around €2.2 billion until 2030, but this is basically related to the long-term planning to reach our target. Maybe more in the coming years, but this is currently based on, let's say, projects which are already in our portfolio and which are likely to be realized.

We have a follow-up question from Olly Jeffery with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Olly Jeffery

Thank you. So, a couple of follow-ups. Could you please just explain or just remind us the mechanics of the regulatory account, that if the regulator agrees over time to linearly reduce that account, how does that impact the IFRS numbers? I presume that results in a lower IFRS number but is non-cash. That's the first one. The second one is, you gave the hedge mark-to-market numbers, Peter, but could you please give the actual hedge number, because then we can update our power price assumptions to see where that comes out at? And then, last question, I'll be interested to see if you have a view on the current, in France, where we're seeing the interconnectors being limited at the moment and you can observe quite a large delta between the German and French power price, which normally trades relatively in line. If you think that interconnection were to be restored, do you have a view on the impact that could have on the German power price? Are EBITDA -- that delta would reduce, and therefore, you could see a flat softening in German power prices. I don't know if you have any view on that at all, but if you do, that would be great to share? Thank you very much.

Peter Kollmann

Unfortunately, I'm only a mechanical engineer and not an electric engineer. However, I will try to give you an idea on sort of like interconnector capacities and their impact on the power price. The objective of the European Union and of the European grid operators is to increase net transfer capacity. And the reason for that is that from a European perspective, the objective has been for a very long time that the delta in power prices between European countries would become much, much smaller.

The reason why we have the partly high differences in power prices is because of the very reason which you have just mentioned, that we don't have enough capacity. As a result of that, we have concessions. The concessions need to be compensated for re-dispatch, re-dispatch can be very expensive.

So from a system point of view, from a system stability point of view, that is exactly the reason why everybody talks about we need -- we can only have an energy transformation if we have a grid transformation.

And by grid transformation, we basically mean two things, no, three things. Number one, we need to increase net transfer capacity among countries.

Number two, we need to work on the grid per se. So we need to get rid of critical branches, as they are called or concessions. So we need to have a free flow of electricity across the network, preferably across Europe.

And number three, and that is one thing we should not forget, we need substations. So we basically need to integrate the Renewables, we need to integrate the decentralized system into the transportation system. That requires tremendous effort, that requires a very smart approach by all the operators, that requires a lot of capital and is an absolute necessity in Europe.

The impact will be that countries that have a large production of base load, like France, through their vast nuclear industry, will have a very stable production of base load. And once they're able to export more into places where you don't have enough base load, like in Germany, that would have an impact on the power price and it would basically reduce the power price.

I'll give you another example. The German regulator has decided that more coal-fired power plants are required in Germany for the reserve, which is something we have discussed many times in those conference calls over the years, that we have basically said, when you get out of nuclear, when you want to get out of coal, when you don't like gas, you end up having a real base load problem.

And that base load problem can partially be solved by exports from France, which is a base load producer, as mentioned before, and of course, by having enough reserves within Germany. So sorry, there was a long answer to your question, but I didn't want to shortcut it, because I would have diluted the complexity of the subject.

Olly, just -- the hedging price -- the hedge price for 2025 is €124.6 and for 2026 it's, one second.

Yeah. €79 and for 2024 it's €126.4. So for 2024 we have €126.4, for 2025 we have €124.6 and for 2026, with only 33% hedged, it's €78.8. With regard to the regulatory account, I mean, you know how it works, basically. So let's say the regulated grid company has an allowed return and should the grid company earn more than what is regulatory allowed, then the difference is allocated to the regulatory account.

So the regulatory account currently stands at €500 million, roughly. As mentioned, it's basically a product or the sum of all the over-earnings which APG has achieved over the last couple of years. Sooner or later, this amount has to be returned or given back to the system. How the regulator will do that, we don't know how quickly. So there is no schedule implemented.

But should the regulator decide to reduce the regulatory account, of course this will have a negative cash effect and it will also have a negative results effect under IFRS, not under local GAAP, because here, the local -- under the local GAAP, the regulatory account can be used and can be accounted, basically.

Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Peter Kollmann for any closing remarks.

Peter Kollmann

Yeah. We have -- we had a very large number of participants today. I would like to thank you all for your interest, even now at the level of the quarter numbers. Thank you very much for your questions, which are all highly relevant and for the discussion, which we always very much appreciate. And I look forward to either seeing you in the meantime on roadshows or hearing you on our next conference call. All the best and thank you very much.

Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now over. Thank you for choosing Chorus Call and thank you for participating in the conference. You may now disconnect your lines.

Record-breaking heat last month that prompted governments in Asia to close schools offers fresh evidence of how climate change is threatening the education of millions of children.

The arrival of seasonal rains has now brought relief to some parts of the region, but experts warn the broader problem remains, and many countries are poorly prepared to handle the impacts of climate change on schooling.

Asia is warming faster than the global average, and climate change is producing more frequent, longer, and more intense heatwaves.

But heat is not the only challenge.

A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which can result in heavy rains and flooding.

This can damage schools or put them out of commission while they are used as shelters.

Hot weather can also drive wildfires and spikes in air pollution, which have caused school closures everywhere from India to Australia.

""The climate crisis is already a reality for children in East Asia and Pacific,"" the UN children's agency UNICEF warned last year.

Mohua Akter Nur, 13, is living proof of that claim, sweltering in a one-room home in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka after her school closed.

Intermittent electricity means she cannot even rely on a fan to cool the cramped dwelling.

""The heat is intolerable,"" she told AFP last month.

""Our school is shut, but I can't study at home.""

- Poorest hit hardest -

April marked the 11th straight month of record global heat, and the pattern is clear in Bangladesh, said Shumon Sengupta, country director for NGO Save the Children.

""Not only are the temperatures higher, the duration of the high temperatures is much longer,"" he told AFP.

""Previously, few areas used to have these heatwaves, now the coverage of the country is much higher,"" he added.

Schools across much of Asia are simply not equipped to deal with the growing consequences of climate change.

Bangladesh's urban schools can be sturdy, but are often overcrowded, with little ventilation, said Sengupta.

In rural areas, corrugated metal roofs can turn classrooms into ovens, and electricity for fans is unreliable.

In Bangladesh and elsewhere, students often walk long distances to and from school, risking heatstroke in the process.

But closing schools comes with serious consequences, ""particularly for children from poorer, vulnerable communities who do not have access to resources such as computers, internet and books,"" said Salwa Aleryani, UNICEF's health specialist for East Asia and the Pacific.

Those children ""are also less likely to have better conditions at home to protect them during heatwaves"".

They may be left unsupervised by parents who cannot afford to stay home, and school closures put children at higher risk of child labour, child marriage and even trafficking, said Sengupta.

- 'Wake up to this' -

Climate change also threatens schooling indirectly.

UNICEF research in Myanmar found that crop shortages caused by rising temperatures and unpredictable rain caused families to pull children from school to help with work or because they could no longer afford fees.

Some wealthy countries in the region have taken steps to protect children's education in the face of a changing climate.

In Japan, fewer than half of all public schools had air conditioning in 2018, but that figure jumped to over 95 percent by 2022 after a series of heatwaves.

Not all impacts can be mitigated, however, even in developed economies.

Australian authorities have repeatedly closed schools because of wildfires, and research has found long-term impacts on learning among students whose communities were worst affected.

Developing countries in the region need help to invest in upgrading infrastructure, said Sengupta, but the only real solution to the crisis lies in tackling the root cause: climate change.

""It's very important for government and policymakers to really, really wake up on this,"" he said.

If you wish to skip our detailed discussion of the global coal market, you can go directly to the Top 5 Coal Exporting Countries in the World.

Ongoing factors like Russia-Ukraine conflict, economic growth, policy changes, and energy demand in the various regions of the world meant that global coal sector underwent continuous shift in the larger sense for the last few years; in 2022, coal saw its supply and demand both reaching its all-time high, where the demand hit the 8 billion tons mark, according to IEA. Furthermore, the demand is expected to stay the same in 2024 as well. Shifts in fuel prices, along with forward market curves are also some of the factors that are causing this trend of the market. With this, the global coal mining market is expected to rise from $648.04 billion in 2023 to hit $795.76 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 2.6%, according to Expert Market Research. The demand for coal is expected to continue to exist and drive the market, despite the recent shift to renewables. If this prediction is accurate, this may be a great opportunity to buy coal stocks (see 11 Best Coal Stocks to Buy)

As far as coal mines are concerned, 3 biggest coal mines of the world are North Antelope Rochelle coal mine, Haerwusu coal mine, and Hei Dai Gou coal mine, with coal recoverable reserve totaling 1.7 billion tons, 1.6 billion tons, and 1.5 billion tons, respectively.

With a record 505.4 million tons exported in 2023, an increase of 54 million tons, or 12%, over 2022, Indonesia emerged as the world's largest exporter of thermal coal, according to Reuters. While Indonesia may top as the global exporter, China, with a 2.5% increase in production to 3,942 million tons in 2021, remains the world's largest producer of coal, according to Global Data. Additionally, China, on its own, is responsible for one-third of the coal consumption on global level, according to S&P Global. While 120 countries don't export any coal, among those that do, the one at the bottom of the list is Sweden, exporting only 10 short tons of coal in 2021.

On the other hand, there have been some notable recent developments in the US coal market. The United States produced 140.8 million short tons of coal in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 3.4% decline from the same time in 2022, according to S&P Global. This production has been predicted to see a downtick in coming years, as S&P Global sees 19% fall in 2024, and another 3% in 2025. The consumption of coal is expected to follow this downward trend in the U.S., as well as European regions, as renewable sources of energy are expected to satisfy 90% of any electricity demand by 2025, according to IEA. As the coal market has allocated the concentration of production onto metallurgical coal for industrial consumption, as well as for exports purposes, the industry looks onto stabilization. During this time, however, employment in U.S. coal mines remained relatively steady despite the drop in production, increasing by less than 1% annually on average. You can see the biggest coal mining companies in the US here.

In the realm of coal mining and production, two industry giants are going to be discussed, namely, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) and Arch Resources, Inc. (NYSE:ARCH).

Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) operates coal mining works across the regions of United States, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, India, Brazil, Belgium, Chile, France, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, South Korea, Germany, and more. The company, headquartered in Saint Louis, Missouri, boasted net income figure of whopping $760 million in 2023, with its operating cash flows from continued operations hitting the $1.1 billion mark! Furthermore, with the purpose of giving back to its shareholders, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) announced $471 million return for them in 2024!

Arch Resources, Inc. (NYSE:ARCH), on the other hand, operates across America, boasting a substantial control in the market, by taking over and controlling coal reserves with the help of long-term leases; these coal lands span across the states of Ohio, Maryland, and Virginia, to name a few. They target the utility, industrial and steel production markets on the domestic, as well as an international scale.

Moving on to the financial performance of Arch Resources, Inc. (NYSE:ARCH), we find that the company's net income of 2023 4 quarter, ending 31 December 2023, stood at $114.9 million, which meant an EPS of $6.07; however, it was a decrease from the prior year's net income figure of $470.5 million, and EPS of $23.18. Also, the company's revenue figure was $774 million for the year, which was a decrease from the prior year's revenue of $859.5 million.

Having discussed the overall situation of the global coal market, we will now move forward to our list of Top 20 Coal Exporting Countries in the World.

The small sphere, which the Norway-based company officially calls a ""neuron,"" has drawn nicknames like ""magic ball"" or ""orb."" Whatever the name, electric cooperative Great River Energy plans to install 52 of these round devices as a way to ease one of the toughest problems facing the modern energy sector: Electric utilities are running out of space on transmission lines to transport a growing amount of wind power and other energy. While more power lines are in the works, those infrastructure upgrades are often expensive.

The Heimdall technology aims to let more power flow along existing wires, which Great River believes could delay major infrastructure work and save its customers money. The nonprofit provides electricity for roughly 1.7 million people through 27 mostly rural cooperatives, ranging from northeast Minnesota to the Iowa border.

Priti Patel, vice president of transmission for Great River, said the orbs ""can unlock untapped capacity,"" and no utility in the country has made a bigger bet on the product.

Great River tested the neurons first, trying out four of them last year. That pilot project found information the sensors provided could allow 42.8% more electricity to flow down a power line.

""If you can increase capacity, ability for these lines to transmit electricity, which is going to be increasingly and predominantly clean electricity, 40% is a big deal,"" said Allen Gleckner, executive lead of policy and programs for the St. Paul-based nonprofit Fresh Energy.

Jørgen Festervoll, CEO of Heimdall, said most utilities have to operate their grids conservatively, restricting them typically 20-40% below actual capacity limits.

The Heimdall neurons monitor the temperature of the line, whether it is sagging, and other data like weather conditions.

""Without software and sensors like this showing the actual temperature on the line, it's like driving without a speedometer,"" Festervoll said. ""And when you're driving critical infrastructure, you do not want to speed, you want to be on the safe side.""

That was fine in the past, he said. But power grids are facing the challenge of handling an influx of renewable energy -- far from where consumers use the electricity -- and rising demand for electricity due in part to electric vehicles and data centers.

Heimdall has 40 customers in 17 countries, including its biggest agreement for 270 neurons in Austria. But Great River has the largest U.S. project.

Great River's orbs will be on a handful of transmission lines spaced through about 150 miles, mainly in north-central Minnesota. Patel said a study revealing some of the most congested areas of the state that are limiting wind power and other energy sources helped determine the location.

Patel declined to say how much the 52 orbs would cost but said the technology will help avoid spending on other projects. Exactly what kind of savings Great River can expect is still up in the air, too. It won't end the need for any new transmission lines, but it could allow Great River to skip line upgrades or other work and use that money on meeting Minnesota's carbon-free standard or other projects, Patel said.

More wind power can save customers money, too, because it's cheaper to produce.

""We are confident that after early next year when we get the results in that it will help us potentially delay some projects, and a delay of even a few years is monumental to a cooperative,"" she said.

The Heimdall technology is only one way to boost power line capacity, a topic that has drawn growing interest in Minnesota.

A group of power line operators that includes Great River, Xcel Energy, Minnesota Power and Otter Tail Power is working on 19 congestion relief projects worth $130 million.

Xcel has used ""dynamic line ratings,"" which are in the same family of technology as the Heimdall orbs, to boost transmission capacity.

Democrats who control the Minnesota House this week voted to approve policies aimed at better understanding and evaluating congestion and the potential for ""grid enhancing technology"" to ease that crunch.

Gleckner said Minnesota still needs transmission projects. Recently, the regional grid operator announced a gargantuan new plan to build more than a dozen new transmission lines across the Midwest with a price tag that could top $20 billion.

But Gleckner said the relatively new Heimdall orbs and technology like it could gain steam, and utilities could adopt them more widely if they can replicate promising results.

""If that is true, this is a no brainer: We should be doing it,"" Gleckner said.

Voluntary reporting of sustainability targets and progress strengthens customer relationships through transparency and accountability Economic success and ambitious sustainability goals can be achieved in conjunction with one another Aiming to be completely climate-neutral by 2050, Vetter joins the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)

Alongside its dynamic growth, Vetter announced that it achieved its sustainability goals for 2023. The Contract Development Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) recently became a member of SBTi and is therefore committed to meeting strict CO2 reduction targets. The pharmaceutical service provider also achieved EcoVadis Platinum status last year, which pushes the company in the top one percent of participants in the globally renowned sustainability ranking. Since 2021, the company has voluntarily published an annual sustainability report, thereby setting an example for the compatibility of economic success and the implementation of ambitious sustainability goals in a high-energy consuming industry.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508453864/en/

(c) Vetter Pharma International GmbH

Vetter Managing Director Thomas Otto says: ""Sustainable growth is not a marketing buzzword for us. We have made a very conscious decision to prioritize growing our sustainability goals dynamically in conjunction with the company's sustainable growth, and we publish status updates in a report that is accessible to everyone. This transparency also strengthens our customers' trust in us and supports them in their own sustainability reporting.""

Vetter adheres to strict climate protection standards for businesses

The CDMO joined SBTi at the end of 2023. Members commit to contributing to a target of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming. The initiative focuses on putting companies worldwide on track to halve their emissions by 2030 and become climate neutral by 2050. To achieve CO2 neutrality, Vetter needs to reduce its annual emissions by 4.2 percent.

As Senior Vice President Technical Service and Internal Project Management, Henryk Badack is responsible for the company's global sustainability activities and explains: ""We are continuously investing in more efficient and climate-friendly processes. Joining the SBTi was the logical next step for us towards achieving Net Zero carbon emissions. To this end, we have defined a plan that sets out the specific measures we will take each year to further reduce our CO2 emissions. In view of the EU Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will apply to us beginning in the 2025/2026 financial year, we are proactively introducing CO2 reporting in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.""

Vetter has invested one million Euros in the construction of a large photovoltaic (PV) system on the roof of its state-of-the-art materials warehouse at the Ravensburg West site. The natural gas cogeneration plant at the site was also converted to biogas for a six-figure Euro sum. Since then, the PV system has generated around 700,000 kWh of electricity per year, which equates to around 10 percent of the site's electricity consumption. This reduces CO2 emissions by roughly 330 tons per year. The conversion to biogas saves around 1,000 tons of CO2 each year.

Vetter stands ready to implement EU supply chain legislation

Social responsibility is a long-prioritized part of Vetter's corporate philosophy and is firmly anchored in the company's sustainability strategy. The family-owned company commits itself and its business partners to a clearly defined code of conduct. With the help of the implemented compliance management system, the CDMO drives employees and partners to adhere to the compliance requirements. The company has introduced processes to assess compliance-related risks with business partners in order to also take these aspects of sustainability management into account.

Vetter Managing Director Peter Soelkner explains: ""We support the objectives of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Many of these requirements were already part of our compliance processes. In view of the upcoming EU Directive, we believe that politicians have a duty to maintain a balance between regulatory compliance and fostering a conducive environment for successful entrepreneurial action.""

Sure, Sam Ryder became a household name in 2022 thanks to his cosmological cri de coeur, Space Man. But when newly solo Years & Years frontman Olly Alexander takes to the stage in Malmo this Saturday to sing Dizzy, he will do so as someone whose band's most-recent album, Night Call, landed at number one in the first of its 23-week run in the UK charts.

To understand why Eurovision can now attract a pop star at the top of his game, we need to step back and look at what, almost by stealth, Eurovision has become over the past 25 years.

A tournament that was once a byword for naffness, synonymous with sexless balladeering, baffling schlager ditties and cabaret corn, has become the music television event of the year. In the UK last year, it secured its highest audience share since records began, while over in Sweden almost a third of the population saw their country triumph with Loreen's pneumatic power ballad, Tattoo.

The staging of the event has evolved to mirror its growing importance, with this year's production designers having worked on Beyoncé's Renaissance tour and Abba Voyage. What you'll see when you tune in is the most ambitious presentation the contest has ever seen: a cross-shaped stage positioned in the middle of the Malmo Arena made up of moveable LED cubes and floors.

Right at the centre of that revolution is the music itself. As we go to press, the bookmakers' favourite is Swiss offering The Code by singing, rapping, violin-playing force of nature Nemo, in which they detail the turbulent journey to realising their non-binary identity.

Also in the frame is Croatia's Baby Lasagna, whose stirring immigration anthem Rim Tim Tagi Dim issues a powerful reminder that sublime and ridiculous don't have to sleep in separate beds. ""Ay, I'm a big boy now,"" intones the Croat poet. ""I'm going away and I sold my cow.""

When it comes to risk-taking pop, the Swiss and Croatian entries are by no means alone. As Eurovision memoirist William Lee Adams explains, ""More than any other year, Eurovision 2024 is a wild rodeo ride. You've got Angelina Mango from Italy singing Cumbia music with hot, spicy passion and then there's Joost from the Netherlands with Europapa, a bonkers but passionate anthem to free movement around Europe.""

Perhaps it's finally time to set aside our accumulated memories of the whimsical commentary box put-downs that came as standard in the days when Terry Wogan was our guide to the madness on stage. Just because we thought that Eurovision was naff, it didn't mean other countries felt that way.

According to Dr Dean Vuletic, author of Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest, the very question itself says a lot about the way we still view ourselves, with perhaps a certain sense of entitlement when it comes to our status as a pop nation.

He mentions the response in 1968 when Cliff Richard's Congratulations lost out to Spain by just one point, prompting newspapers to imply that Spanish state television had rigged the vote on behalf of General Franco's fascist regime: ""All that soft power you didn't know you had, because you never lacked it? The visibility Britain had through its language and its pop culture - for other countries, there are few international platforms that allow them to have that same visibility.""

By contrast, Vuletic talks about the way Abba's Waterloo suddenly amplified Sweden's reach after the 1974 contest. ""No country has done better out of Eurovision than Sweden with Abba. Prior to Abba, Sweden was not a power when it came to popular culture. Now its third-biggest export industry is popular music. And when you combine that with the soft power potential of companies such as H&M and Ikea, then that's pretty amazing.""

What Sweden seemed to realise accidentally with Abba's victory 50 years ago was something that the group themselves knew all along - that this could be the cannon that would blast them to huge international success. That when the world is watching, you need to supplant all their preconceptions about you and replace them with something way better.

Abba studied the British pop charts and set about planning their moment like a world-class bank robber would plan a heist. Bjorn Ulvaeus recalls, ""I know that we wanted to pack it with energy. It's all energy, energy, energy. That was during the glam-rock era and groups like Slade and Sweet, those British bands... All those records were so full of energy. And we wanted to pack that much energy into Waterloo as well.""

In a poll conducted by BBC One for the channel's 2020 TV special Eurovision: Come Together, Waterloo was voted the greatest Eurovision song of all time, followed by Conchita Wurst's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix.

What does that tell us about what it takes to come up with a winning formula in 2024? Not much, according to Katrina Leskanich of Katrina and the Waves, whose Love Shine a Light was the last British winner, back in 1997.

""Was Love Shine a Light really the best song?"" ponders the singer, most remembered for her group's 1985 hit Walking on Sunshine. ""I'm not sure. I'll tell you something, though. It wasn't even written for Eurovision. It was written for the Swindon branch of Samaritans. Our drummer's brother worked there, and they needed a theme tune for their 50th-anniversary celebrations. So our guitarist Kimberley Rew wrote it and we shoved it in the bottom drawer, thinking it was too Eurovision to put on one of our records. So when we got an approach to submit a song, we submitted it.""

Leskanich remains proud of Love Shine a Light, but adds that ""so much of what happens depends on the night, on what all the other songs are. There was a good feeling about the UK that week, because Tony Blair had just come to power and he was hugely popular across Europe. All that stuff plays a part.""

In other words, context and politics matter. Without it, would Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra have secured an outright win in 2022 for their entry Stefania? The prospect of three minutes broadcasting to an entire continent is a chance to influence the narrative - and occasionally, argues Adams, turn Eurovision into a propaganda tool.

By way of example, he cites A Million Voices, Russia's 2015 near-winner by Polina Gagarina - who subsequently became a prominent figure at pro-Putin rallies - which promoted the notion that Russia was a peacemaker in that part of the world. The uneasy truce in the old Soviet Union was something that didn't go unnoticed by Terry Wogan back in 2008, when Russia received 12 points from Ukraine. In remarks that now seem prescient, he muttered: ""Ukraine just want to be sure that the old electricity and the oil flows through.""

""Anyone who feels that politics has no place in Eurovision probably hasn't been paying that much attention,"" says Adams when asked about calls from Swedish musicians such as Robyn and First Aid Kit to exclude Israel's Eden Golan from this year's contest. Golan's song was originally called October Rain and featured lyrics directly referencing Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, but was rejected by the Eurovision Broadcasting Union, prompting a new lyric that now answers to the name of Hurricane.

Eurovision has always, to a greater or lesser extent, acted as a detailed tapestry of what's happening across the continent at any given time. That has been a constant going back to the very first contest in 1956, when West Germany fielded an entry by Holocaust survivor Walter Andreas Schwarz with a self-composed autobiographical song in the chanson style whose title translates as Luckily in the Waiting Room.

So how best to think of Eurovision and the place it holds in the collective psyche? Rather like Camp chicory coffee and those people who walk around pubs with a tray of seafood, if we didn't already have it, no one would invent it. It's a space that exists to be claimed by anyone who needs it badly enough. And since 1998, when Dana International emerged victorious with Diva, the biggest driver of Eurovision's resurgence has been the visibility of LGBTQ+ singers in the contest.

The sight of the Israeli singer emerging victorious that May night had an unforgettable effect on the then nine-year-old Rylan, watching in Stepney, east London. ""I didn't entirely understand why it was such a big deal,"" recalls the Radio 2 presenter, who was a member of the UK's song selection committee this year. ""But then to find out, obviously, that Dana was trans... my brain was a bit, like, 'Oh, so that woman has not always been a woman'. That was my first connection with Eurovision, seeing everyone talking about it. It was fun, but also there was a sort of gravity to that moment.""

The success of Diva is a splash whose ripples continue to push outwards and was followed by winning turns from Serbia's Marija Serifovic in 2007 and Austria's Conchita Wurst in 2014.

If anything, then, it feels overdue that finally in 2024 Britain gets to be represented in Eurovision by an LGBTQ+ singer. Russell T Davies, who selected Olly Alexander as the lead in his 2021 Channel 4 drama It's a Sin, says: ""Look, I'm biased, I love the man. And I'm fascinated to see how much his appeal transcends borders. There's something so unusual about Olly, something shifting and elemental. He's like a sprite. Or a devil. I never quite know what's going on in his eyes. I wonder how that'll come across on a tough, huge production like Eurovision.

""I worry that big, huge voices win on the night. He's more interesting than that. But Eurovision keeps changing - just when you think it's all about big ballads and key changes, along comes Netta [the defiantly outlandish Israeli 2018 winner]. So my hopes are high!""

Alexander himself says he has ""put all thoughts of winning to one side"". Expectation management is wise at this stage. Although the surging happy-sad Europop of Dizzy will surely see his star rise across Europe - with a projected 200 million streams of the song on just that one night - current betting doesn't have Alexander right up there with the leaders. But as Rylan points out, ""A lot can change in the fortnight leading up to the contest. Staging is definitely a factor.""

Regardless of what happens on the night, as Alexander says, ""It really isn't about coming first. So many Eurovision moments that have stayed with me and inspired me happened with songs that didn't even go beyond the semi-finals. That's not what it's about.""

So what is it ultimately about? ""It's not real life,"" says Adams. ""It's the opposite. For three minutes on the Eurovision stage, everything is perfect. This is a moment where you can put aside all the drama, all the trauma, sing your heart out and be appreciated. Because every Eurovision performance - whether it's difficult, whether it's easy - ends with applause.""

The Contract Development & Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) recently became a member of SBTi and is therefore committed to meeting strict CO2 reduction targets. The pharmaceutical service provider also achieved EcoVadis Platinum status last year, which pushes the company in the top one percent of participants in the globally renowned sustainability ranking. Since 2021, the company has voluntarily published an annual sustainability report, thereby setting an example for the compatibility of economic success and the implementation of ambitious sustainability goals in a high-energy consuming industry.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508453864/en/

Vetter Managing Director Thomas Otto says: ""Sustainable growth is not a marketing buzzword for us. We have made a very conscious decision to prioritize growing our sustainability goals dynamically in conjunction with the company's sustainable growth, and we publish status updates in a report that is accessible to everyone. This transparency also strengthens our customers' trust in us and supports them in their own sustainability reporting.""

Vetter adheres to strict climate protection standards for businesses

The CDMO joined SBTi at the end of 2023. Members commit to contributing to a target of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming. The initiative focuses on putting companies worldwide on track to halve their emissions by 2030 and become climate neutral by 2050. To achieve CO2 neutrality, Vetter needs to reduce its annual emissions by 4.2 percent.

As Senior Vice President Technical Service and Internal Project Management, Henryk Badack is responsible for the company's global sustainability activities and explains: ""We are continuously investing in more efficient and climate-friendly processes. Joining the SBTi was the logical next step for us towards achieving Net Zero carbon emissions. To this end, we have defined a plan that sets out the specific measures we will take each year to further reduce our CO2 emissions. In view of the EU Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will apply to us beginning in the 2025/2026 financial year, we are proactively introducing CO2 reporting in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.""

Vetter has invested one million Euros in the construction of a large photovoltaic (PV) system on the roof of its state-of-the-art materials warehouse at the Ravensburg West site. The natural gas cogeneration plant at the site was also converted to biogas for a six-figure Euro sum. Since then, the PV system has generated around 700,000 kWh of electricity per year, which equates to around 10 percent of the site's electricity consumption. This reduces CO2 emissions by roughly 330 tons per year. The conversion to biogas saves around 1,000 tons of CO2 each year.

Vetter stands ready to implement EU supply chain legislation

Social responsibility is a long-prioritized part of Vetter's corporate philosophy and is firmly anchored in the company's sustainability strategy. The family-owned company commits itself and its business partners to a clearly defined code of conduct. With the help of the implemented compliance management system, the CDMO drives employees and partners to adhere to the compliance requirements. The company has introduced processes to assess compliance-related risks with business partners in order to also take these aspects of sustainability management into account.

Vetter Managing Director Peter Soelkner explains: ""We support the objectives of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Many of these requirements were already part of our compliance processes. In view of the upcoming EU Directive, we believe that politicians have a duty to maintain a balance between regulatory compliance and fostering a conducive environment for successful entrepreneurial action.""

My name is Nathan Wrigley.

Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how AI is shaping WordPress workflows.

If you'd like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.

If you have a topic that you'd like us to feature on the podcast, I'm keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head over to wptavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.

So on the podcast today, we have Paolo Belcastro. Paolo works at Automattic, where he's focused on Jetpack and .blog products. He's been working remotely since 1994, and managing distributed teams since 1998.

He's on the podcast today to talk about AI. And he certainly brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in integrating AI with web development. .

Paolo brings detailed insights into how they're making decisions about what to develop in Jetpack AI. This is to take it beyond simple tasks like typo corrections, and grammar adjustments, to more sophisticated functions, such as content translation, tone adjustment, and even complex texts summarizations. All done directly within the WordPress editor.

The focus isn't just on the functionality AI brings, but also on the efficiencies it introduces for developers and content creators alike. Allowing them to shift their focus from tedious tasks to more creative and challenging aspects of web development.

We also tackle the broader implications of AI in the tech industry. Discussing potential risks, the ongoing concern about AI's impact on jobs, and the ethical considerations of AI in creative roles.

We get into an exploration of the balance between AI's utility, and the indispensable value of the human touch in crafting meaningful digital experiences.

With Paolo's insights into the recent advancements in open source AI models and the collaborative efforts within the AI community to keep platforms accessible but innovative, you'll gain a comprehensive view of where AI in web development stands today, and where it might head tomorrow.

If you're a developer, a tech enthusiast, or anyone interested in the intersection of AI and creative processes, this episode is for you.

If you're interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com forward slash podcast, where you'll find all the other episodes as well.

A quick note before we begin, this was recorded live at WordCamp Asia. There was quite a lot of background noise to contend with, and I've done my best to make the audio as easy to listen to as possible.

And so, without further delay, I bring you Paolo Belcastro.

I am joined on the podcast by Paolo Belcastro. Hello.

[00:03:48] Paolo Belcastro: Hi Nathan.

[00:04:59] Nathan Wrigley: Very, very nice to have you on the podcast today. We're going to talk about AI, the topic which keeps on giving, throughout the year 2023, and probably throughout 2024 and 2025. Because we're talking about AI, I guess, Paolo, it would be useful to know what your credentials are. To get some understanding of why what you say carries weight. So will you just tell us a little bit about you, what you do for a living, who you work for. Biography, really.

[00:04:15] Paolo Belcastro: Yes. So I work at Automattic, the company behind wordpress.com, Jetpack, WooCommerce, and I work particularly on Jetpack.

And my AI credentials, so to speak, are that, since last May, so about a year ago, we started working on Jetpack AI, that we launched in June 2023 at WordCamp Europe. And we have been developing this set of tools for people to use AI in the editor directly.

I'm also a very heavy user of AI tools. So for that you have to take my word, but I've been using them a lot. Yeah, and I made a presentation about AI yesterday, here at WordCamp Asia.

[00:04:58] Nathan Wrigley: Was it well attended? I imagine AI is popular at the moment.

[00:05:01] Paolo Belcastro: Yeah, it was actually as attended as the room allowed, like people were sitting on the floor, so I couldn't. But yeah, it's not a very big room, but I actually like a small room packed much more than a large room half empty, so I was pretty happy.

[00:05:14] Nathan Wrigley: How have you managed to integrate AI into the Jetpack suite of things? I'm guessing this is all still fairly new.

[00:05:22] Paolo Belcastro: Yeah it's fairly new, still experimental. We are really trying to produce experiences, and listen to users who use them, and adapt them. Our first iteration was really about saying, let's just bring the tools that everybody can now access in ChatGPT, or at the time was called Bard, it's now I think Gemini. And basically bring them to the editor. Why would you have to go and copy paste with all the formatting problems that can arise?

So we extended the Gutenberg editor with a block, an AI block, that is a chat interface, where you can chat with the AI assistant. And we also extended a certain number of blocks, like the paragraph, the title, the headers, the table, and the forms, with an AI button that you can use to ask for a certain number of operations. And we started with what AI does best, which is text transformation.

So say you have written something, you can ask, of course, for typo and grammar correction, that's the most used feature. You can ask for translation, which is really useful for people who, like a lot of people might want to publish in English, but that's not their primary language. Of course, there's other translation tools out there but, again, having it in the auditor is practical. And it does, of course, translation across many languages, not just to English.

We have also a tone transformation. If you, say you wrote something and you feel like it should be a little more formal, or more informal, maybe humorous, so you can choose one of the tones. You can of course summarise text, you can ask it to expand on something you wrote. So those are all tools to help you polish your text.

Now, I am a strong believer of the fact that AI is very valuable. Use it as a tool to improve what you are writing, as opposed to a tool that is going to write for yourself. So I don't really believe we can get to any good results, at least today, by starting with a blank page and telling AI, hey, write me an article about Taipei, because I went to WordCamp Asia and I'm too lazy to blog. I don't think that works. It's going to write the same article for everyone, or roughly. And so that's not interesting.

What is interesting is, I write a draft about Taipei because I'm here, and I write my experiences, and maybe it comes out a bit like a stream of consciousness. And then I can ask the AI, can you take all that text I wrote and make an outline for me?

So now I can organise my ideas that I put in that text. And maybe I feel that, okay, I should move that up, I should move that down, I should remove this. And once my outline has been polished, and has become a little more clear, I can actually tell the AI, can you take my original draft, this new outline, and reorganise my draft to match this new outline?

So now I have a new draft where I've been working with AI, like I would be working with an assistant, or with a colleague, or with someone helping me. I find that's where the value really lies, because then it's still me. It means that someone else, doing the exact same steps, will get to a completely different result, because it's their mind, their content, their experience.

But we can accelerate the process, because it's all about producing more, not for quantity, but because more writing leads to better writing. The quantity leads to quality. It's not just about putting out more content. It's that, whatever the craft you are in, whether it's writing, photography, recording podcast, it doesn't matter, the more you do it the better you get.

[00:08:53] Nathan Wrigley: So your key takeaway there, it feels like is that the human is at the center of all the things. You still need a human in order to produce something that humans would like to consume. So it's not, you know, if you write the article about Taipei, and you don't in any way inspect what's been written, the chances are you're going to end up with something that is, no human is going to wish to consume.

It will fill up the words on a page. It will look like 10,000 words, in the same way that everything else with 10,000 words would look. But you'll get into it and you'll immediately have an intuition that, actually, what is this? There was no care taken in this. Okay, that's interesting.

[00:09:31] Paolo Belcastro: And what's interesting is that, that happens of course. The tools are there available to everyone, and so definitely people started using them to produce tons of content. It's not very different from what they were doing before. There were already content farms before, and people writing tons of articles about subjects that they know nothing about.

I don't know if you like cooking, but if you have looked for a recipe online, you have all these sort of SEO content, that is completely irrelevant for cooking the cake, but it's there. That existed before. AI allows you to do more of that, but it's not more value than before. If you don't share your experience, if you don't share your feelings, if you haven't lived through the things, then it's not Interesting, interesting for humans.

[00:10:13] Nathan Wrigley: There was something that you said a moment ago, and I've written down a series of questions and I've shared them with you. But there was a couple of things that you said which interested me, and I'd like to pursue that for a moment.

You talked about the different things that Jetpack AI can do. And you mentioned you can do translation, you can change the tone. There was a bunch of other things. Are you only able to do those variety of things that the AI companies provide with their API? I don't know if that's how it's working. So they offer the capacity to change the tone, they offer the capacity to change the, I don't know, the language or what have you. Is there a limited subset of things that you can do because of what they provide to you?

[00:10:51] Paolo Belcastro: Well, we actually do a bit more because, yeah, I got on a tangent and we haven't finished what Jetpack AI can do for you. So the way those API work, and this is the very interesting part is that those tools, those large language models as they're called, manipulate text, generate text basically. The core abilities generate text, actually their core abilities figure out what the next most likely word is after a given text.

But text is not only content. Text can also be instructions, or text can be a configuration file, text can be a JSON object, it's all text. So we can do more sophisticated things than just generating text. For example, the first very basic step is that, if you go to Jetpack AI and oh, can you give me the list of the 10 most visited monuments in the world, ranked by order of traffic, and put them in a table.

Now the AI is going to do couple of things. First is going to, of course, go and seek that data in the training data they have. Or online because now they can actually go online and check on other websites and get fresh data. Then it's going to create content you asked, but then it can also format it, in this case for a table using markdown, so that in your editor you get a table block inserted, as opposed to a list of things.

That's when the AI becomes interesting, is that, anyone who has used a table block in Gutenberg knows that, once the table is there, if you want to reorder it, for example, it's a little bit of an annoying work, because you don't really have a way to select all and say, sort by this field. The AI can do that, so you can say, reorder this table by alphabetical order, and it's going to do that.

And we push the experiment a little further with Jetpack Forms. So Jetpack Forms allow you to create forms, a recipe form, a contact form, a subscription form, whatever. And the standard way we have been doing it for a while was that, when you insert a form block, we offer you seven templates. You choose one, or you choose an empty. And once you have your form, then you are manipulating manually. You can add blocks, remove blocks, all the sub elements of the form.

And now we have added the AI system to the form. So you can ask for a form that does exactly what you need. So for example, your RSVP form, let's say it's for a dinner, you can say, well, add menu to indicate allergies to food. It's going populate it with the most common ones. Of course, you can ask for more if you need. Oh, actually I want to know where people come from, so can you add a menu with all the cities in Austria, because maybe I'm organising a dinner in vienna and I want to know that.

And that is very interesting because on the one hand it's practical, because filling those menus with all the options is very long. But also now the AI is manipulating Gutenberg blocks. So we had to figure out how do we get, because typically, for example, something interesting is that the API will stream the result back to us. So we get that as a stream of data, but we cannot display it as a stream of data, because otherwise blocks would be invalid as long as they're not closed.

So we had to learn how to buffer those elements, so that we only show blocks. But we don't want to wait for the whole stream to be finished, because it's nice to stream the result. And so now what we do is that we buffer the stream, so that we showed block by block, and so we stream in bigger chunks. This is all experimentation that is made possible by the fact that, yes, those API only manipulate language, but actually everything we do is language, because coding is language.

[00:14:32] Nathan Wrigley: It just occurred to me, sitting here now having this conversation, three years ago, if we were to sit here, the same conversation that we're having now would've been absolutely unimaginable. There's not one part of it where any of that was plausible. That was science fiction, what you just said, three years ago, that you write something in and a service which has seriously large amounts of data at its disposal, gives you information back, and then the website that you run puts it into a table, you can then tell it to be reordered, and we could go on. There's a million different permutations.

Completely impossible. And yet now, well, not mundane, that's the wrong word, but you get the point. It's now trivial, and it's what everybody expects. And that's really remarkable.

[00:15:18] Paolo Belcastro: Yeah, that tells something about how progress doesn't happen always in a continuous line, there's steps. And we have seen those before. I mean, I was one of those people old enough to watch the presentation first iPhone. That keynote, that is almost ridiculous to think that this is just a consumer device, it's like a piece of metal and silicon and everything.

But back then it made me happy, curious, excited to try a new gadget. Today, it almost makes me cry when I watch it because it's a pivotal moment. Our lives have changed. Our lives were some way, and now are a different way.

As much as someone can disagree with, you cannot disagree really with that. You can be angry about it if you want, but the reality is that having internet in your pocket has changed the world. There were other moments like that, you know, your first dialup internet connection.

For me, that's where it stops because I was born in 1970, so I had a computer in 1982, and that's the first of those moments. I assume other people might have that with television, or the car in the past. So there's those pivotal moments in our history that are really important. So I think this is one of those, that's why it's so critical.

And then though, it tells also something about our ability to adopt new technology fast. Because the first computer, I got one in 1982 in my house. It took years before there was a computer in every house. And then the iPhone took a lot less, but still a few years before everybody had an iPhone, or a Android equivalent phone in their pocket. And now because each one of those layers has enabled the next one, well, when the pivotal moment is an app, and everybody has a phone with internet in their pocket, the path is very short.

[00:17:08] Nathan Wrigley: To say that AI is available to a significant proportion of humanity, I think is true. And it was available right out of the gate, because you can do it from the phone, you can do it from your laptop. Incidentally, my moment there was the first time that I saw a flat LED color screen. I remember just staring at that thinking, how did they get color into that? It was remarkable.

Okay, so, absolutely true, there's AI everywhere. Tell us what it can do at the moment to help WordPressers. Obviously you've been through that you can create forms, you can ask it to create content for you in the form of text, and what have you. Can it do other things? Is it possible to, for example, create entire pages, or entire websites, or images that can drop in?

[00:17:51] Paolo Belcastro: It can. So in terms of images, for example, we launched a feature recently that is actually not in Jetpack AI yet. We launched it on wordpress.com, which is a logo creator. And so what it does is that when you say, oh, I need a logo, because most WordPress themes have a space for a logo somewhere, generally on the top left corner. It takes whatever content is already in the site, maybe the tagline, the site name. There isn't much generally, because that's often something you do at the beginning, but it takes that and generates a logo for you.

And then of course you can alter it. You can chat with the assistant to say, I don't like this, or I want it monochrome, or I want it more stylish, or I want it more modern. So that's one example. We started with the logo because we figured that was one of those situations where you generally want to create an image out of nothing, as opposed to modify existing images.

Now, there's other developments at Automattic, for example, on the WooCommerce side. I have to admit, I'm not up to date with the latest things they launch, because it's a big company Automattic now, and it's hard to follow everything in real time. But they are launching features centered around managing a store online.

There are a few tools you probably have heard out of WordPress, that allow you to create websites, or landing pages with AI. I cannot really go into detail because there are experiments running inside Automattic right now, they're not yet ready for prime time. I only can say stay tuned. AI can do a lot more than just manipulating text.

[00:19:25] Nathan Wrigley: It feels like the goal for many people, the desire for many people, is to put a non-technical user in front of a computer, and within five minutes, something approximating a finished website will appear. So like you say, you can handle the logo right at the outset.

We install WordPress, vanilla version of WordPress, and we go through some kind of process. Tell me about your website, just give me a few sentences. Where are you based? Do you want a contact form? Yes. And then out the back, five minutes later comes a website.

I don't know if that's ever going to deliver the perfect website, but it feels like a lot of people would love something like that. And I think there are commercial products that do things like that, but I don't really know.

[00:20:10] Paolo Belcastro: So there's two interesting things here. I want to put a pin on the non-technical user that you mentioned, because I think we should come back to it later. It's a very interesting point of discussion. But going to the creating the site, yes of course, everybody wants to be able to very quickly get to something that resembles what they need, or what they have in mind.

It's not a new thing. For example, WordPress through themes has always allowed something like that, where you look at a theme repository, you're like, oh, I really like this one and I can picture it with my images and this. And then, yes, once you install that theme, it took a little bit of knowledge to get it really where you want it. So definitely, we can have AI tools that accelerate this process.

And what's interesting here is that , I go back to what the human puts in, it's still going to need an understanding of how should a website, for example, you are building a restaurant website, the fact that you have tools that make it easier and faster to get the result you want, still require you to know exactly what is the best way to present a restaurant, so that it has more appeal, that people want to book it, that people understand the menu.

So what's interesting here is that, again, we build tools that accelerate the process, but the value of the human remains the same. If someone has built sites for 35 restaurants, and someone else has never built one, the results that person that has experience will get with AI will be much better than the person who has never built one. Because, out of the box without the human input, the AI will have a tendency to, again, go average. That's the whole point of figuring out the most likely token that comes out of a suite of tokens is converging to the middle. And so the presence of the human makes the whole difference.

And then there's the question of, oh, is this a tool for an end user building one site, or is this a tool for a professional building sites for clients? I would argue for both, because the professional, probably the AI will save them less time per site, because they already had processes, they already had templates, they already a system to streamline launching a new site. But maybe they save less time per site, but because they do that hundreds of times a year, the benefit is huge.

Whereas the end user, they will save a lot more time on a given site. But maybe they build only one, so that's going to be a one time gain. I think also about the fact that now we can customise the way AI behave a lot. There's custom instruction, there's system prompt, there's a number of tools. I want this AI to consider this context, this data, this frame of reference. And we can imagine there that professional user that does that very often will invest more time in customising their AI, and making it suitable to their need, so that it's more and more efficient for what their specialty is.

[00:23:09] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It's interesting because one of the key things about your talk was, you really did want to make it clear that you are very bullish about the fact that AI is not going to be taking away jobs from web developers. I'd like to sort of develop that a little bit, because I, like everybody else, have been confronted with that possibility. And in my mind I've thought, if this gets really good at doing all the things that I can do, and it appears to be, that's not a horizon which I can't foresee us arriving at fairly soon. But you are much more sanguine. You think there's always going to be space for the developer. There's always going to be space for the human, and the technical things, the experience that they bring. So let's just unpack that a little bit.

[00:23:48] Paolo Belcastro: Yeah. So let's use a parallel with another technological revolution. Let's think about the Industrial Revolution and Agra Revolution. There used to be a time in Europe where 9 out of 10 people needed to be farming the land or breeding animals. Before the Industrial Revolution, 9 people had to work in a farm to feed 10, and those 10 were themselves, and then one. So that gave one person the possibility of doing something else. And then we invented more tools, and mechanical tools, and we invented engines, and we automated all that. Today, 250 years later, maybe one person, every thousand, needs to be a farmer to feed everyone.

Now, there's two things that are interesting here. First of all, it has taken a long time. It hasn't happened overnight. Also, still today, we need farmers. So my point is to say AI, as an entity, is not going to take your job. Another developer using AI might be taking your job though, because they're going to become a lot more efficient. But the reassuring part in that is that now becomes accessible to everyone. If I am afraid that AI is going to take my job, how can I compete with a machine? But if I'm looking at another person using a tool that I can also use, now it's up to me to say, well, if I want to keep doing this job, I can use the tools, they're available to me.

Now what's going to happen, like in every previous technology revolution, is that it's going to also create a ton of new opportunities. So there might be people that would've been developers without AI, and now will be something else. The same way as, there were 9 out of 10 people farming the land 250 years ago, now it's 1 every 1000. We are way more people on Earth, and still almost everyone has a job.

[00:25:43] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, those 999, they have things to do.

[00:25:46] Paolo Belcastro: They have things to do. Even just the last 50 years, like we look at the computers have removed a ton of jobs that are now useless, because they were so easy to automate that we didn't need AI. I remember, for example, when I was a kid, a friend of my parents, I remember I was impressed because I visited the place and I was impressed. They were working in one of those central telephone station, where you would connect people.

[00:26:12] Nathan Wrigley: Oh yeah. Literally the wires plugged into the wall.

[00:26:15] Paolo Belcastro: That's now completely automated. But those people, like they did something else. So AI is a tool. As a tool it's going to accelerate the work we do in some areas. Create new opportunities in others, but it's just a tool. And like any other tool, if it's just laying down there, is not going to do anything.

[00:26:33] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I think the thing that maybe causes people concern is, a, the fact that it all seems to be happening so quickly. So, you know, the farming analogy, it probably took many hundreds of years for the, slowly the technology became better, incrementally. It wasn't like we went from 1000 farmers to 1 farmer, because somebody invented the combine harvester, and the motorised tractor overnight. So I think we're living through that, potentially quite scary bit, because it's all happening so quickly.

But I do like your analogy of the developer armed with AI, is likely to be a better developer. Given two equal developers, who've got the same experience. You know, if you could literally clone a developer and have an identical one, but put AI with this one, and this one is not allowed to use AI, you can imagine that the AI version of that developer is going to get to a different result, possibly quicker, more efficient, and what have you. And I like that. That kind of makes the AI a partner in a way, feels nicer.

[00:27:34] Paolo Belcastro: Yeah, definitely. And I would add one thing that feels even more nice, which is that, if you could clone this developer just for the sake of the experiment, and one has AI and the other doesn't. It's not just that the one with AI is going to deliver faster. Fast forward six months, they're not the same developer anymore, because the one with AI, in those six months, has been able to remove from their plate a lot of the tasks that are not really creative, where they don't grow, and focus on the ones that are really hard.

So that's when I was mentioning, I used the term tedious in my presentation a lot yesterday, because I was saying the AI can remove the tedious part of your work. Typically in the work of a developer, there is time spent thinking. By the way, most people overestimate the time a developer spends writing code on a keyboard. Most of the time you spend thinking. And then there's the time spent writing on the keyboard. And a lot of that time is spent writing the same things over and over, because there are elements that are needed.

Whenever you start a new plugin for WordPress, for example, there's a whole file structure that you have to put in place. Whenever you do this and these things, you will have to add all those sanitising functions, and you will have to add those unit tests, and that is not really creative. This is stuff you have done 20 times, 100 times, 1000 times. You just do them automatically.

If you can save all that time to focus on the pieces that you have never done before, that's where you grow. You challenge yourself. So six months in, those two developers have a very different trajectory, that's the more important point. It's not just the acceleration, it's that the learning experience is accelerated by removing those pieces.

[00:29:15] Nathan Wrigley: It feels like you are definitely reassuring me, because I think there is a part of me which sits on the worried side when it comes to AI, but every time you say a little bit more, I feel a worry going away, so this is good.

Let's keep going down that track. Can you become better at using AI? Is it possible? In the same way that two people who can write PHP code, somebody is going to, you can just become better at it. There's certain things that you can learn. Can you do the same with AI? Are there interesting novel ways to improve? Because I keep hearing in the media, that learning how to prompt AI is going to be a valuable skill of its own in the future.

[00:29:54] Paolo Belcastro: I think so. Definitely yes now. I would add that it's imaginable that, as those tools become more and more sophisticated, the difference between abilities to prompt might fade. Because part of the skill today is in understanding the limitations, and leveraging, or working around those limitations to get the result you want. So it's possible that as we go forward, those limitations disappear, and more sophisticated tools require less precision.

So what's important today, I would say is training, testing, trying. I think that there is nothing like wanting a result, and trying in 20 different ways to get to that result, and see what works best. If you ask a question to, let's use ChatGPT as an example, as the most popular. You ask a question to ChatGPT, it's going to give an answer. There's many ways to improve that answer. You can go back to your question, and you can say, my question might be a bit vague, maybe I have to specify the context.

Typically a lot of the early work was about saying, well, you have to tell ChatGPT who they represent. What is the role they're playing? I remember, for example, reading, this was a blog post from the people who built Copilot at GitHub, and they were explaining a principle. It wasn't exactly how they did it, but more the principle. They were saying, imagine you are configuring an assistant to be a support agent.

Now, you could tell the assistant, you are a support agent, and you are helping a customer fix their cable connection, whatever. The customer is angry, they want to watch their football game, you have to fix that fast. And maybe you can even say, oh, and here's the documentation where you need to find information. But then what they were saying was, you can be more subtle and say, for example, you are an excellent support engineer, best of your class, and you work at this company where you support clients, and there's these clients, there's this case study of a client that had this problem.

And as it happens, you open your briefcase, and you look for the documentation of this case study, and the case study explains how you fix the problem. And this is the text that is on the page. And that's where the AI takes over. And so that's a way to say to the AI, you are an expert support agent, doesn't mean much for the machine because the machine is not a being, sentient, these are just words.

So if you set the stage for the text they are supposed to be produced in the highest quality, which is, here's an intervention where we help a customer, and it was so good that it's a case study. And now you still give the documentation and everything, but you have set the stage for the AI assistant to actually continue that conversation properly.

This is one type of example. There's another example of breaking down into step-by-step reasoning, chain of thought. You ask a question and you say, for example, you asked to write a function that does something. You get the output, and then you can ask the AI, can you explain me, step-by-step, how you got to this result? And now what's interesting is that, by redoing the same work but step-by-step, the AI will develop each step and make corrections along the way. Because suddenly, where the first output was the result of this probabilistic analysis, the second output changes because, once the first point is laid down, oh, suddenly the second point that is more likely is not what was there before.

Because before it was seen as one thing. And now, step by step, the AI, there are people that say, this is not something I really have, I mean, I've tested, but just very briefly. There are people that say that you get better answers if you're polite. And the idea behind that would be that, in the training data, conversations where people were polite were more likely to be constructive and helpful. Whereas conversation where people were rude, were probably less likely to be constructive and helpful, and therefore you direct the AI to use one area of the training data as a support.

But there's other people that say that, actually it's better to be direct and ask for the thing, as opposed to, can you do this and that? Because if you say, can you do this to a human, they'll do it for you. But if you say, can you do this to a machine, they might sound like the sarcastic human that answers, yes I can, and then doesn't do it. There's people who have experimented with tipping, which you cannot actually do, but you can promise. You can say, hey, I'll give you £100 if you do this and that for me. And apparently they say that the result would be better. Which, it's hard to understand there what is the truth.

Recently something very interesting happened. There's Anthropic launched Claude 3. It's supposedly better than GPT 4. It has three levels of quality, based on how much you're ready to pay for the responses. They started testing it. And now there's a number of tests that are run on these LLMs to evaluate their performance.

The test that they ran was funny. It's called the needle in a haystack test. So the idea is that you give a lot of content to the assistant, and then in that content you put one paragraph about a subject is completely unrelated to the rest of the content. And then you ask a question about that specific point. Previous versions of LLMs had a tendency to not be able to answer, because the fact that that content was very short, compared to the mass of other content, it was kind of overlooked.

On top of that, apparently LLMs had a tendency to over index on the beginning of the provided content, and the end, and less the middle, which by the way is very much similar to humans.

[00:35:50] Nathan Wrigley: Absolutely.

[00:35:51] Paolo Belcastro: But in that context, so there was, I can't remember, the 200,000 tokens were about some subject, I can't remember what. But the one paragraph that was the needle in the hay stack was about pizza toppings. And then they asked a question about pizza toppings. Claude 3 replied the right answer, so it got the reference.

But then added, it's odd that there is content about pizza toppings in this text that is very long, and has no relationship with the subject. It's almost as if this was a test for me to see if I'm paying attention.

Which is very funny because the first reaction is, oh my god, this thing is sentient. When the reality is very likely elsewhere. I think that the reality is much more that there might be in the training data mention of this type of text, because it's hard now to isolate the data and say, oh, we shouldn't train AI with anything that talks about AI. It's almost impossible.

[00:36:45] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, so the AI may have picked up on a piece of text describing an equivalent AI test.

[00:36:50] Paolo Belcastro: I think that's very likely, that it might have picked up on a paper, a research paper, or something like that. Now, is there a possibility that I am completely wrong, and these things have been sentient for a couple of years already, and they're just telling us bit by bit? Yes. I don't have a way of being 100% sure, but I would say I think that everything that, I think it's, what is, Hanlon's razor?

[00:37:14] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, Occam's razor.

[00:37:16] Paolo Belcastro: Occam's razor is that, the most simple explanation is very often the right one. And so I'd be tempted to still think they are tools. They use mathematics to figure out language, and so they are able to produce those answers that make a lot of sense.

[00:37:31] Nathan Wrigley: But I guess the thing that's interesting there is it's so surprising. And it presents us with things which are well within its own capabilities, but they're beyond the bounds of a typical human. So it seems like there's something else going on. But it's more plausible that it's just a function of the data that's been given. But because we can't hold onto that much data, it seems like a god-like quality, but it's not.

[00:37:53] Paolo Belcastro: No. Yeah, and we have other examples of things like that, that we got used to over time. I mean. If you recall, you probably have seen, I mean, neither of us were alive back then, but we probably have seen the images. When the Lumiere brothers showed the first movie of the train arriving in the station, everybody ran away. It's very similar. If you think today, like the quality of that black and white movie, how can you imagine that being realistic? But it is.

I grew up with small TVs and black and white images, and it felt surreal. And now, of course when I look back at those things, I'm like, how is that even possible? You know, we talk about impossible things for humans, but I came here on a plane. I try to fly by myself, doesn't work.

[00:38:38] Nathan Wrigley: I never get over plane journeys. It's always remarkable.

[00:38:41] Paolo Belcastro: How incredible is that? And so, yeah, this one is new and so we have this moment of reaction. At the beginning you said something, or we going to talk about AI 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now. I think AI is going to stay. I don't think we're going talk about AI as much, as we don't talk about electricity as much.

[00:39:01] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, or the film, or the aeroplane.

[00:39:03] Paolo Belcastro: It becomes part of the landscape. It's there, but the novelty is we have all those images. On top of that, you were mentioning before that the, at the moment of the Agricultural Revolution, people weren't scared about what was happening, because it didn't happen overnight. I would also argue, they didn't have a ton of movies and TV shows showing them a future with no farmers.

We do have that, and so the moment we hear AI we're like, oh my god, Sarah Connor, where is she? She has to save us. But these are movies.

[00:39:34] Nathan Wrigley: That's a really good point. So the fact that we're in this 24/7, plugged in, media fed ecosystem, you know, where you just pull out your iPhone and you've got data coming in about the news. Yeah, that's a good point. I hadn't really thought about that. And so if you were the farmer in the, 1500's, nobody was telling you, this is a concern, this tractor. So you're not going to be concerned. Yeah, it's a really good point.

Do you trust AI with your code? Do you get it to generate code and find that it's largely error free? I was saying to you before we hit record that, if you create an image with AI, and it's slightly incorrect, it doesn't really matter, because the fingers look strange, or the ear lobes look a bit weird, but we can forgive it.

And in the same way that if we create text for our blog post, we can modify that, or we may be happy with it at the beginning, and just accept that it's got a few errors in it, and we'll publish it anyway. But with code, I think we could be introducing security problems, or just simple errors. How confident are you writing code with AI, and how much do you have to go back and check every line?

[00:40:36] Paolo Belcastro: So this is a really good question. And I will use my specific context to answer it, because I haven't been writing code that goes into production for a living since 1998. At Jetpack I am head of product, and I've been working with engineers for the last 26 years. So my code, I do still for fun, do stuff on my own, but is not critical at all. It's little plugins that I'm the only user of. So it's not really a concern for me.

But what I would say is, this is an area where it's really interesting. And that's where the dimension of AI as a tool really is important. If you are a really good developer, you won't have that problem because the AI is going to make you save time. It is going to make you move faster, but you'll be able to recognise the problem in an instant. The same as if I am writing either blog posts for my blog, or if I'm writing internally at Automattic for our P2, you know, about Jetpack, about the blog, about any of the things I work on.

I know the field I'm writing about. And so, if at some point in the process, and the back and forth I use AI for, it introduces something dumb, I see it instantly. My point basically, because it's a tool, and it's not sentient, and it's not intelligent, use it to help you in area you have expertise. In the areas where you are an expert, you can use it to accelerate your work. In the areas you are just interested in, you can use it if it's not critical work.

But please don't go near it in areas where you have no knowledge, and or critical. As an example, I would say, a surgeon using AI to go through papers faster might make sense, because they can spot the mistake. Me using AI to diagnose symptoms that I have, maybe I found a rash on my arm, and I'm going to ask AI, very bad idea.

So I think in that scale, if you imagine that as a two by two matrix, am I the expert or am I a total newbie in this area? And then on the other axis, is this critical or is this completely safe? If we are on the safe side where there's no consequences, it's like a little plugin I'm writing for myself, or I'm asking AI about five things I could visit in Taipei, great. I can use it and just take the answer. Worst case scenario, it doesn't work. If it's critical, then I have to be the expert, and the AI is a tool that helps me be better at my job. But is not a tool that helps me do a job I'm not an expert of.

[00:43:17] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that's a good answer. So moving on, I've got a few more questions. We'll try to be as quick as we can. The first question was, there seem to be a few companies which are dominating the AI space. So you've mentioned already Google, I think we could throw Open AI into that, and Anthropic, and there's probably some more, but they're the only three that come into my mind.

Does that part of the jigsaw puzzle concern you? That we're increasingly reliant on three or four, maybe there's more five, six large language models. And I just wondered if, given that we're WordPress and we love open source, if there's a platform, a project, which is trying to do something, but more in the open. Even though it's called Open AI, it doesn't feel particularly open.

[00:43:58] Paolo Belcastro: Yeah. So the interesting thing in the last year or so is that there has been a lot of movement on the open source side. It's a bit ironic that the biggest advances on the open source side come from Meta, which is yet another very large company. But it doesn't really matter because that's the power of open source is that, once it's in the open. So one thing with AI, and LLM's, and open source is that it's really important to understand what is actually open. Because an LLM, in terms of code, there isn't like that much code.

If I give you an LLM post-training, it's great to have it, and to be able to read the code and everything, but you can't really modify much on it. If I give you the training data, then it's a lot more interesting, because then you can reproduce. Now, keep in mind I'm not at that level technically. I am very much out of my comfort zone. But so my point is that, what has happened is that the first few foray to open source, or kind of open, but only the tail end of it. And so, okay, you get a tool that you can use, but you can't really modify it, or you can't really understand how it works.

And now there are versions that are open source from A to Z, including the dataset. Now, they're not as big dataset, they're not as powerful as the ones from the big names you mentioned. But what it appears is that it's actually evolving very fast, because of course, being open source, once you put that in the hands of thousands of developers, in conjunction with the fact that we live at a time where computers can actually run that stuff locally. And so developers on a MacBook Pro, M3 can actually work, which wasn't the case not that long ago. I think that this is going to catch up very fast.

Now, I believe, frankly, that is going to resemble software, where you know, you have WordPress that is the leader, CMS, like 43% of the websites and everything. That doesn't stop closed platforms from existing. The two systems are probably going to be side by side. What we see now, for the moment, but again, we are super early stage, is we're still at a moment where the closed platforms are moving faster. Because the kind of means that Open AI, or Google, or Anthropic have, open source takes a bit of a longer time to set up.

Like it's very fragmented. A lot of people are doing different things. There isn't like a strong coordination. And also they have then the infrastructure to run those models at scale, and to provide answer very quickly at a cheap price. I don't expect them to be shadowed by open source anytime soon. But I do think that we have definitely hope that, going forward, we'll have open solutions.

[00:46:50] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It feels like that would be a nice outcome, if that did happen.

[00:46:54] Paolo Belcastro: One thing that is also important is that, for example, today the approach of Open AI, and Google, and Anthropic is very monolithic. It's saying, we have this gigantic thing that knows everything and can help you. Whereas the open source approach is, because we cannot run such large models locally on laptops, it's more to focus on simpler agents, that are more specialised at given tasks. And that then more complex task would be a collection of simpler agents, maybe orchestrated by another simple one.

So it's interesting because we have seen the approach in the industry in general, right? You have monolithic industries that will build like a car. And every piece that goes in it, and every little part, they will have factories doing everything. And then you'll have other type of industries where the same car is built by buying the tires here, the battery there, the engine there, the windshield there, and then assembling all that. And I think that both models can work. I don't see a future where there's going to be either only one, or only the other.

[00:48:00] Nathan Wrigley: I think that's good. That makes me feel better about it all, because it does feel that, at the moment, it's all about Open AI, and they really are sort of dominating. I would like to think of a future where there are different alternatives.

Okay, couple of questions. We'll be very brief about these one, because I've used up lots of your time, but I've enjoyed it, I have to say.

[00:48:18] Paolo Belcastro: No worries.

[00:48:18] Nathan Wrigley: In your presentation, you make the point that AI offers you the possibility, and I'll just quote here, AI removes all the tedious parts of our work so that we can hone our craft, and there's more but that'll do for now. I had this intuition when I read that, and I just thought, maybe tedium, tedious, boring is an important part of the human condition. And I don't really have a question around that, but is life spoiled a little bit, if there's no boredom anymore, if everything's quick and rapid? From a business perspective, that's a dumb question. But from a sort of psychological perspective, and just a human nature perspective, I wondered if you had any thoughts on that.

[00:48:58] Paolo Belcastro: Yeah, I actually don't think it's a dumb question, even from a business perspective. I just listen to a little snippet from Rory Sutherland, who talks about, of course he's in the advertising market, and he's talking about using AI to remove all those steps and create a visual for a campaign, for example. And he was saying, we have to be careful, because in some of those jobs, the end result is not that important. It's everything we learn along the way that is important. It's the questions we ask to our users, to our vendors, to our sales people to get to that result that are really important.

And I would say, I think that is very clear, that if we consider AI like a black box, in which I input an order, and I want a result on the other side, it's not a good way to use it. It's not progress. It's not going to help us learn. So I go back to the example of me writing a blog post. If I tell the AI, write me a blog post about this subject. And even if I add, oh by the way, in Taipei, day one I did this, day two three, here's five things I did, write me a blog post.

The blog post at the other side is not going to be great. I won't have learned anything. I won't have grown in any way. But if I use AI as a partner to write this post, and so what I do often is start by writing a draft that is really raw, really stream of consciousness, as it comes. Then I go to the AI and I say, can you, out of this draft, create an outline, and highlight the main ideas I'm talking about?

And that first step already allowed me to do something critical, which is that I have a natural tendency of holding too many ideas in my head, and then writing blog posts where I talk about too many things. And then I lose people, and then people don't really know what it's about. Or then there's no conversation after with my readers, because there's so many subjects they don't know what to talk about.

But by giving the AI the draft, and asking for an outline, and the main ideas, now I have much more clarity about what I was writing. So now I can reorganise this outline and I can say, actually, okay these go in that order, and these actually go in this order but out of this post, this is another post. So let's move that aside.

And so now I can go back to the AI, and have my simplified outline and I say, using my original draft, and using this modified outline, reorganise my original draft please, and write a new draft that fits this outline. And then I read that. And then I fix a lot of things. I correct, I remove any word that I wouldn't use, and I put my way of speaking in it. But then I can go back to the AI and say, what is missing here? Am I missing an obvious point, or how am I wrong in this? And I sort of get the AI to challenge me a bit.

This is one of the things I mentioned in my presentation is that, it's not just about accelerating, it's also that the AI provides us with a partner that can give us feedback about our content. There's the basic grammar, typos, and things like that, but also feedback about the quality, the clarity. But also a challenging partner that doesn't belong to our own intellectual bubble.

Because when I ask feedback to my friends, I'm asking feedback to people that kind of think similar to me. I mean, we're friends. What I'm saying basically is that, when I say removing the tedious part, I'm not saying shorten the path. It's more about saying, remove the things I've done 20 times, 50 times, 1000 times in my life already, that don't teach me anything anymore. And allow me to improve the quality, by challenging me, by giving me feedback, by doing those things that normally I wouldn't have access to. Because, I mean, I've occasionally asked for feedback on a piece to friends or family, but I can do that once a year. I can't bother people around me all the time like that.

[00:52:54] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, the AI is good, it doesn't get bored.

[00:52:56] Paolo Belcastro: I want to be very clear with that, that it's not about shortening the journey itself, as much as it is increasing vastly the density of the enriching steps.

[00:53:06] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, you said, at some point towards the beginning of your answer, you encapsulated it as, something along the lines of, it should allow you to grow, you'll grow from it. That seems to be a nice place to sort of round it off.

So the idea of AI, if I'm getting you correct, is that it's kind of a partnership. It's not something you should use in isolation. It's certainly not something that you should use if you don't possess some capacity already, especially with code. And so use it as a partner. Enable it to speed things up. Enable it to teach you in the same way that you might go to the library and read a book. You're going to learn something from it.

So it's not something to be feared, it's something to be used. But it's also, I guess this conversation is, be mindful. Don't fall into those pitfalls. Don't just use it blindly to create those articles that the audience is going to be zero, because it's going to be so anodyne and uninteresting.

That's interesting. I was definitely more on the, not the terrified side, but the nervous side when we began this conversation. And you've definitely taken me off the ledge a little bit. So thank you so much, Paolo, for chatting to today. I really appreciate it.",wptavern.com,news,WordPress Tavern,,0.1843137254901961,452873048,1,https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/119-Paolo-Belcastro-on-How-AI-Is-Shaping-WordPress-Wordflows.jpeg,eng-9541338

Eavor-Lite, Alberta. (Credit: Eavor Technologies Inc.)

One of the significant developments has been Chubu Electric Power's decision to participate in the Eavor-Loop project under development by Alberta (Canada) based start-up Eavor Technologies at Geretsried, Bavaria, Germany. Chubu is taking a 40% stake in Eavor Erdwärme Geretsried GmbH, the operating company for the project, and is already a shareholder in Eavor itself. Eavor holds the remaining 60% of Eavor Erdwärme Geretsried GmbH.

Eavor-Loop is a ""closed-loop"" concept for geothermal heat extraction in which a working fluid that is completely isolated from the below-ground environment is circulated in subsurface pipework, ""collecting heat from the natural geothermal gradient of the Earth via conduction.""

Eavor (pronounced ""Ever""), established in 2017, says this approach ""represents the world's first truly scalable form of clean, dispatchable, baseload capable, and flexible heat and power,"" and achieves this by ""mitigating or eliminating many of the issues that have traditionally hindered geothermal energy.""

Building on Eavor's experience with a pilot installation in Canada and the Eavor-Deep deep drilling demonstration in New Mexico, the Geretsried project will see four closed loops installed about 4500 meters underground. It will be the first commercial application of Eavor-Loop technology.

The heated circulating fluid will be used to provide district heating (64 MWt) and for power generation (8.2 MWe) via an organic Rankine cycle (ORC).

The ORC technology provider is Turboden (part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Group).

Another key supplier is pipe maker Vallourec, which previously worked with Eavor on the New Mexico demo project.

Drilling of the first loop at Geretsried started in July 2023, with ""partial commercial operations"" - completion of the first loop - expected in October 2024. The start of full-scale commercial operation, with all four loops completed, is targeted for August 2026.

This project is receiving a 91.6 million euro grant from the EU Innovation Fund.

By participating, Chubu says it plans to acquire experience in and additional knowledge of the geothermal business, with the possibility of future applications of the Eavor-Loop technology in Japan.

The project also benefits. ""Geretsried, with Chubu's involvement, changes everything,"" said John Redfern, Eavor president & CEO.

In June 2023, Eavor completed the first close of their Series B equity round. OMV led the round with a €34 million investment and entered into a commercial agreement with Eavor to pursue large-scale deployment of Eavor-Loop technology in Europe and beyond.

OMV will be focused initially on the deployment of Eavor-Loop in Austria, Romania, and Germany.

In March 2023, Eavor announced the signing of a cooperation agreement with Sonoma Clean Power for the development of up to 200 MWe of new geothermal power through the GeoZone initiative in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, California.

An Eavor-Loop entails the connection of two vertical wells with many horizontal multilateral wellbores creating a closed sealed radiator-like system.

Eavor has developed a set of technologies for economically drilling and connecting such a network of loops thousands of meters below the surface.

Successful completion of the Eavor-Deep drilling demonstration project in New Mexico was announced in January 2023.

Combined with the proof of concept demonstrated at the Derek Riddell Eavor-Lite™ demonstration facility in Alberta, Canada in 2019, the milestones reached at Eavor-Deep ""validated all the key elements required to construct and operate commercial Eavor-Loops,"" says Eavor.

The Eavor-Lite prototype facility consists of two vertical wells, joined by two multilateral legs at 2.4 km depth, connected by a pipeline at the surface. The rationale for this design, which is not intended to be commercially viable, is to build a facility that proves and demonstrates all the critical elements of Eavor's technologies at the lowest cost. The demonstration was ""designed to achieve the most efficient path to acceptance and commercialisation of the technology by facility developers and commercial financiers.""

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (who has visited the Geretsried site) has pledged to greatly increase the use of geothermal energy in Germany, envisaging tenfold expansion by 2030.

Meanwhile, in the UK, ORC technology provider Exergy International and Geothermal Engineering, developer and operator of geothermal plants, have signed a contract for the supply of a 3 MWe gross capacity ORC power plant at the United Downs site, in Cornwall. This represents the first integrated deep geothermal project in the UK. As well as 3 MW of baseload electricity, it will also deliver up to 10 MWt of zero-carbon heat to a large housing estate at Langarth Garden Village, a project being developed by Cornwall Council.

Exergy is also working with Pertamina Geothermal Energy on the development of geothermal power plant projects in Indonesia.

In Kenya, Globeleq, described as ""the leading independent power company in Africa"" and its project partner, the state-owned Geothermal Development Company, have broken ground on the 35 MW Menengai geothermal project in Nakuru County.

The $108 million Menengai project is Globeleq's first geothermal plant. It will operate and maintain the power plant once it achieves commercial operation, targeted for 2025.

Menengai is a greenfield geothermal project and part of the first phase of the wider Menengai complex, which is the second large-scale geothermal field being developed in Kenya after Olkaria. Steam will be supplied to the power plant by GDC under a 25-year project implementation and steam supply agreement. Once the plant is operational, electricity will be sold to Kenya Power, under a power purchase agreement for the same timeframe. Toyota Tsusho Corporation from Japan is the EPC contractor. Fuji Electric is manufacturing and supplying the steam turbine and generator.

The outlook for residential and commercial geothermal projects has also improved in New York, following a vote by the NY legislature to reform geothermal drilling regulations.

The vote was in particular welcomed by the New York Geothermal Energy Organization (NY-GEO), a trade association representing the geothermal heat pump industry in New York State.

Jens Ponikau, president of NY-GEO and co-owner of Buffalo Geothermal said: ""To expand the drilling depth for closed loop geothermal bore holes is an important step forward to enable geothermal systems to be installed in dense urban settings.""

The change in current regulations, which treat geothermal systems at depths greater than 500 ft as oil and gas drilling, is expected to open up opportunities for buildings with smaller footprints, and ""residential and commercial buildings not able to benefit from the energy bill savings of geothermal heat pumps now can. The ability to drill beyond 500 ft will make geothermal systems more affordable to install and accessible to more New Yorkers.""

Looking at the wider European geothermal market picture, the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC) has recently published its assessment of geothermal market developments in 2022, the 12th edition of its annual Geothermal Market Report.

In 2022, there were 142 geothermal power plants in operation with an installed capacity of about 3.5 GWe, achieving an average capacity factor of 79%, the ""highest of all electricity sources,"" notes EGEC.

In 2022, the expansion of geothermal district heating and cooling capacity persisted and by year-end, there were 395 operational systems -- an increase of 14 compared with 2021 - as well as more than 300 projects under development.

EGEC expects more than 30 wells to be drilled over the next three to five years for geothermal power plants, and more than 100 wells for heating projects.

2022 witnessed an all-time high in the sales of geothermal heat pump systems, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. With over 141 300 GHP systems installed, sales in 2022 were 17% higher than the previous year. A continuation of this upward trend has already been confirmed in the first quarter of 2023, particularly in Germany and Sweden. More than 2.19 million geothermal heat pumps are in operation in Europe.

EGEC observes that 2023 marks the 110th anniversary of the first-ever geothermal power plant, which entered operation in 1913 in Larderello, Italy. It also notes that the oldest geothermal power plant still in operation is from 1986.",nsenergybusiness.com,news,NS Business,,0.223529411764706,452856646,5,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Eavor.jpg,eng-9552487

However, the energy market value drivers that are key to VERBUND's earnings have deteriorated compared to the highs of 2022. The second half of 2023 saw another sharp fall in prices for emission allowances and gas, which have a knock- on effect on wholesale electricity prices. The marked decline in gas prices was driven by lower demand as a result of the mild winter, Europe's somewhat sluggish economy and relatively high natural gas storage levels. Given these factors along with a lower anticipated earnings contribution from regulated grid operations, the earnings outlook for 2024 as a whole remains very healthy, but well below the results for 2023.

Despite the changes in the energy market environment, we are systematically forging ahead with our sustainable Strategy 2030, which aims to strengthen our integrated positioning in the domestic market, expand new renewables electricity generation in Europe and develop a green hydrogen economy. Mission V, which we launched at the beginning of 2023, is our roadmap for mastering the challenges ahead and pushing on with the grid and energy transition. As such, VERBUND achieved further milestones in quarter 1/2024, both in generation from renewables and in the Grid segment, designed to ensure a sustainable and reliable supply for our customers. The Reißeck II plus, Limberg III and Stegenwald hydropower plant projects under construction to boost our renewable electricity generation proceeded as planned. Reißeck II plus is slated for completion in quarter 4/2024. Over the next three years (2024-2026), we will be investing around €1.8bn in further grid expansion projects such as ""Energy Security in Upper Austria (Central region)"" and the 380 kV Salzburg line. VERBUND's strategy also envisages significant growth in photovoltaics, wind power and battery storage between now and 2030, by which time we aim to generate around 25% of our total electricity from photovoltaic systems and onshore wind power plants. Austria, Spain, Germany and Italy are some of the countries identified as strategic target markets for this. Expanding wind and solar power will expose the grid to major fluctuations that have to be balanced out by (pumped) storage power plants and, in future, increasingly by battery storage. VERBUND therefore plans to install 1 GW of battery storage capacity by the end of 2030.

VERBUND posted slightly lower results in quarter 1/2024 due to a weaker energy market environment. EBITDA fell by 8.7% year-on-year to €883.4m. The Group result was down 4.3% to €506.0m. At 1.29, the hydro coefficient for the run-of-river power plants was 36 percentage points above the prior-year figure and 29 percentage points higher than the long-term average. By contrast, generation from annual storage power plants fell by 4.8% in quarter 1/2024 compared with the prior-year reporting period. Generation from hydropower thus increased by 1,804 GWh to 7,893 GWh. Earnings were hard-hit by the sharp drop in futures prices for wholesale electricity that were relevant for the reporting period. Spot market prices likewise retreated in quarter 1/2024. The average sales price achieved for own generation from hydropower fell by €84.7/MWh to €118.1/MWh. Despite higher generation from photovoltaic installations and wind power plants, particularly those that came on stream in Spain, the earnings contribution from the New renewables segment declined slightly due to lower sales prices.

Earnings forecast for 2024 adjusted

Based on expectations of average levels of own generation from hydropower, wind power and solar power as well as the current opportunities and risks identified, VERBUND expects EBITDA of between around €2,800m and €3,300m and a Group result of between around €1,450m and €1,750m in financial year 2024. VERBUND's planned payout ratio for financial year 2024 is between 45% and 55% of the Group result of between around €1,450m and €1,750m, after adjusting for non-recurring effects.

The earnings forecast and the information on the expected payout ratio are contingent on VERBUND not being impacted by any further measures to partially tax windfall profits at energy companies.

Agriculture or renewable sources of energy - in the past, it was either, or. Agricultural PV is a new, innovative approach offering promising options for agriculture and climate protection by joining agricultural production and the generation of electricity on the same surface.

Extensive subsidies

European countries such as Germany and France subsidize agricultural PV with the aim of deploying more solar energy while reducing the competition for land use. Germany has introduced a separate auction segment with a top value for ""special solar installation"" (which includes agricultural PV installations) in the Solar Package 1, and France is deemed one of the pioneers for dedicated legislation. Other countries, such as Austria and the Netherlands, also promote their agricultural PV sector.

Benefits of agricultural PV

The advantages of dual land use are obvious: It reconciles solar energy with agriculture, and the protection against storm, hale, frost and draught adds an extra bonus for farmers. The electricity production costs are lower than from small roof-mounted installations, and farmers' income is diversified. Shading and wind protection provided by solar panels reduces evaporation, and innovative solar panels have been developed that also collect rainwater for irrigation. This can benefit farming operations by boosting their resilience against crop failure.

Best practice projects

Pilot projects are emerging all over Europe. In the Dutch local authority of Meierijstad, for example, BayWa r.e. AG and their subsidiary GroenLeven are implementing a pioneering agricultural PV project, a 8.7 megawatt peak solar installation covering a vast raspberry plantation. On Sicily, figs and olives grow between the module rows of Europe's largest agricultural PV plant. In Neißeaue, Germany, Next2Sun Technology works on a 20 megawatts solar farm with vertical modules.

Intersolar Europe 2024: special attention on agricultural PV

Intersolar Europe is putting a particular focus on agricultural PV. A special exhibit in the Outdoor Area will be dedicated to the topic. Partners of the special exhibit are BayWa AG, BayWa r.e., Conexio PSE, Vista Geo and ZIMMERMANN PV-Steel Group. What's more, of the more than 1,370 Intersolar Europe exhibitors, some 60 exhibitors will be showcasing agricultural PV products and solutions. Experts will dive deeper into the topic and offer even wider information at a number of sessions at the Intersolar Forum and the Intersolar Europe Conference.

Intersolar Europe

As the world's leading exhibition for the solar industry, Intersolar Europe demonstrates the enormous vitality of the solar market. For more than 30 years, it has been providing a networking opportunity for key players, focusing on the latest trends, developments and business models under the motto ""Connecting Solar Business"".

Market Dynamics Drivers: Increasing demand for odorless and tasteless coconut RBD oil in the food & beverage industry

RBD coconut oil is made from dried coconut with a fatty acid profile rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Coconut oil and its special MCTs are digested differently, straight from the GI tract to the liver, helping the body to produce instant, steady energy. It is excellent for extensive frying because of its high smoking point (450 degrees Fahrenheit) and the fact it does not contain a coconut aroma or taste so that the coconut won't interfere with the flavoring of other foods. The high levels of lauric and caprylic acid also make it a great choice for cooking since these fats are known to fight inflammation caused by unstable polyunsaturated fatty acids, making them a healthier oil to prepare food products.

Restraints: Rising concerns regarding the high content of saturated fats in coconut oil

Several studies have claimed that coconut oil raises blood cholesterol, including harmful LDL and, in some cases, triglycerides. Studies have concluded that because its cholesterol-raising effects were comparable to other saturated fats, the oil should not be viewed as a heart-healthy food and should be limited in the diet. According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in a meta-analysis of 16 clinical trials, coconut oil was found to increase both LDL and HDL cholesterol levels in participants, compared to tropical vegetable oils (e.g., sunflower, canola, olive).

Opportunities: Potential application as biofuel

Biofuel is produced through a chemical reaction called trans-esterification or alcoholysis. This reaction occurs between alcohol such as methanol and vegetable oil in the presence of a catalyst such as sodium or potassium hydroxide. The reaction then yields a biofuel with many similar properties to conventional diesel fuel. Coconut oil blends yield a very comparable output of energy as conventional diesel. At the same time, coconut oil exhaust contains far less harmful emissions than conventional diesel exhaust. Coconut oil in Pacific countries is increasingly used in transport and electricity generation owing to its lower local cost.

Challenges: Irregularity in the supply of raw materials

Coconut oil is made from copra and fresh coconut meat. Being a naturally produced fruit in farms, coconut production is vulnerable to several factors, such as diseases and floods, which may decrease its production. It could negatively impact the supply of copra and fresh coconut meat required to produce coconut oil. India is one of the largest producers of coconuts in the world.

The German Institute for Building Technology (DIBt) has granted general building approval for the 400W double-glass solar panels with red frames. They have a 20.02% power conversion efficiency and use TopCon solar cells.

The managing director of Sonnenkraft, located in St. Veit a der Glan, Peter Prasser, unveiled the new solar module and praised its ""Terracotta"" panels for their potential to ensure that the preservation of monuments and the generation of sustainable energy work together.

According to Prasser, the terracotta module gives local added value and is the ideal choice for design-conscious clients with red-tiled roofs.

Solar energy systems are widely recognized for their advantages. Once installed, a solar system can help cut down on hazardous emissions, save power expenses, and even raise the value of a home.

Most people find the thought of paying to install a solar system daunting. Sources indicate that the average home will cost between $15,000 and $20,000 to install solar panels.

This represents the full installation cost. Numerous tax breaks and credits have been developed by both the federal and local governments to promote the use of solar panels.

However, according to a previous report, even with the substantial 30% federal solar tax credit, the installation's overall cost is usually far higher than $10,000.

Specifically, a household solar system normally costs between $10,290 and $20,580 in the United States.

Biden recently celebrated Earth Day with a primary focus on solar power, revealing that it is rolling out $7 billion in federal grants for solar power projects to benefit low-income communities.

The US EPA's Solar for All initiative, which will supply residential solar power projects to over 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households nationally, will be the source of the additional money.

A net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050 and a zero-carbon power sector by 2035 are two further objectives that the program will help the administration achieve.

According to EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan, the chosen individuals will promote solar energy projects around the nation, which will result in the creation of numerous well-paying jobs, a reduction of $8 billion in family energy expenses, improved air quality, and the fight against climate change.

Furthermore, the administration claims that solar projects financed by this effort will generate close to 200,000 jobs.

In addition, the program supports Biden's Justice40 project, which aims to provide 40% of government funds for affordable and sustainable housing, clean energy, and other projects to underserved regions.

Despite recent expenditures, the US still has a ways to go regarding solar energy. Official statistics show that only about 3.4% of the electricity generated in the United States comes from solar energy, a small increase from 2.8% in 2021.

Solar power also produced energy from renewable sources, which increased from 13.5% in 2021 to 15.9% in 2022.",techtimes.com,news,Tech Times,Aldohn Domingo,0.3725490196078431,452833011,1,https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/426946/820/0/0/0/trump-administration-imposes-tariffs-on-imported-solar-panels.jpg,eng-9541699

""With our new solar module 'Terracotta,' which is produced in Austria, we would like to make a contribution to ensuring that monument protection and sustainable energy production go hand in hand,"" said Peter Prasser, managing director of St. Veit an der Glan-based Sonnenkraft. ""The terracotta module is also the perfect solution for design-savvy customers with red tiled roofs and contributes to local added value.""

The 400W double-glass solar panels have red frames, and have general building approval from the German Institute for Building Technology (DIBt). They feature TopCon solar cells and have a power conversion efficiency of 20.02%. (Solar panel efficiency - how much sunlight a panel converts to electricity - typically ranges from 15-23%.)

Solar panels are typically blue polycristalline or black monocrystalline, so panels made of ""colored encapsulation material [that] achieves a homogeneous red effect,"" as Sonnenkraft puts it, is something I've not seen before. (Let me know in the comments below if you have.) If they had lame power conversion efficiency, then it wouldn't be a story - but they don't.

These panels open up a new set of possibilities for listed buildings in Austria and beyond. There's nothing wrong with wanting renewables that are aesthetically pleasing.

I have a brown metal roof. If there were solar panels that had the same efficiency and cost as the panels I have now that matched my roof, I would have gladly chosen them.

Latest tracking systems for agricultural PV applications will be presented at the ""Intersolar Europe Special Exhibit Agrivoltaics"". (© BayWa r.e.)

Agriculture or renewable sources of energy - in the past, it was either, or. Agricultural PV is a new, innovative approach offering promising options for agriculture and climate protection by joining agricultural production and the generation of electricity on the same surface.

Extensive subsidies

European countries such as Germany and France subsidize agricultural PV with the aim of deploying more solar energy while reducing the competition for land use. Germany has introduced a separate auction segment with a top value for ""special solar installation"" (which includes agricultural PV installations) in the Solar Package 1, and France is deemed one of the pioneers for dedicated legislation. Other countries, such as Austria and the Netherlands, also promote their agricultural PV sector.

Benefits of agricultural PV

The advantages of dual land use are obvious: It reconciles solar energy with agriculture, and the protection against storm, hale, frost and draught adds an extra bonus for farmers. The electricity production costs are lower than from small roof-mounted installations, and farmers' income is diversified. Shading and wind protection provided by solar panels reduces evaporation, and innovative solar panels have been developed that also collect rainwater for irrigation. This can benefit farming operations by boosting their resilience against crop failure.

Best practice projects

Pilot projects are emerging all over Europe. In the Dutch local authority of Meierijstad, for example, BayWa r.e. AG and their subsidiary GroenLeven are implementing a pioneering agricultural PV project, a 8.7 megawatt peak solar installation covering a vast raspberry plantation. On Sicily, figs and olives grow between the module rows of Europe's largest agricultural PV plant. In Neißeaue, Germany, Next2Sun Technology works on a 20 megawatts solar farm with vertical modules.

Intersolar Europe 2024: special attention on agricultural PV

Intersolar Europe is putting a particular focus on agricultural PV. A special exhibit in the Outdoor Area will be dedicated to the topic. Partners of the special exhibit are BayWa AG, BayWa r.e., Conexio PSE, Vista Geo and ZIMMERMANN PV-Steel Group. What's more, of the more than 1,370 Intersolar Europe exhibitors, some 60 exhibitors will be showcasing agricultural PV products and solutions. Experts will dive deeper into the topic and offer even wider information at a number of sessions at the Intersolar Forum and the Intersolar Europe Conference.

Intersolar Europe

As the world's leading exhibition for the solar industry, Intersolar Europe demonstrates the enormous vitality of the solar market. For more than 30 years, it has been providing a networking opportunity for key players, focusing on the latest trends, developments and business models under the motto ""Connecting Solar Business"". Intersolar Europe will take place from June 19-21, 2024 as part of The smarter E Europe at Messe München.

We have also discussed the challenges of urban development in Europe. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Least Urbanized Countries in Europe.

Urbanization in Europe has been a defining trend of the past century as a significant portion of the population now resides in cities. According to recent studies, approximately 75% of Europeans now live in urban areas. This concentration of people in cities has led to various challenges in Europe, such as the development of coastal cities, which are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and other climate-related risks. Research from Kiel University suggests that Europe's coasts which are already densely populated are facing major threats from sea level rise. In response, coastal protection measures and spatial land use planning strategies, such as setback zones, are being implemented to safeguard coastal communities as studies indicate that implementing effective setback zones could reduce the vulnerability of new urban developments by at least 50% in most EU countries by the year 2100.

It is worth highlighting that Monaco is the most urbanized country in Europe with 100% of its population living in urban areas. To read more about urbanized countries, see the most urbanized countries in Asia.

Apart from coastal threats, urban development in Europe in general is facing a series of critical challenges and opportunities. With more than 80% of the population projected to live in urban areas by 2030, the focus on sustainable urban planning has never been more urgent. Inadequate housing conditions alone contribute to over 100,000 deaths annually in the WHO European Region. Moreover, transportation, industrial activities, and domestic heating continue to contribute to pollution in European cities. Approximately 2.8 million land sites across the European Union are affected by pollution and thus, demand an environmental action.

As enviormnetal concern has become a key concern for urban development. AECOM (NYSE:ACM) is playing an active role in advancing the NeuConnect interconnector project. Capitalizing on expertise across the UK, Netherlands, and Germany, AECOM (NYSE:ACM) facilitated the preparation of permits and environmental impact assessments for the project's entirety. This involved managing various stakeholders and coordinating permit applications for approximately 720 kilometers of submarine cables, with an additional 12 kilometers onshore.

In the Netherlands, where nitrogen emissions are of critical concern, AECOM (NYSE:ACM) developed proactive strategies to mitigate environmental impact during construction. Furthermore, AECOM (NYSE:ACM) conducted thorough Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for all subsea cable work in Dutch waters to compliance with environmental regulations. As a result, permits were successfully granted in 2022 that enabled the project to move forward.

With construction underway, NeuConnect will have the capacity to carry 1.4 gigawatts of electricity which will benefit over 1.5 million homes and potentially reduce carbon emissions by over 13 megatons of CO2 over 25 years. By facilitating cross-border energy exchange between the UK and Germany, AECOM (NYSE:ACM) is driving the region towards a more resilient, secure, and sustainable energy supply.

On the other hand, Jacobs Solutions Inc (NYSE:J), in collaboration with PA Consulting, is set to impact urbanization in Europe through its involvement in enhancing the Copenhagen Metro. The Copenhagen Metro serves as a key component of urban infrastructure that caters to over 300,000 passengers on weekdays alone. The partnership between Jacobs Solutions Inc (NYSE:J) and PA Consulting has been selected to provide comprehensive research and advice on the operation and maintenance of this critical transport system.

The Copenhagen Metro has already made several contributions to urbanization since its inception in 2002. With over one billion passengers having utilized its services, it is one of Europe's most advanced public transit systems. Importantly, expansions such as the M3 Cityringen and M4 Nordhavn, with further extensions planned, demonstrate the metro's commitment to accommodating the growing population and urban travel demands of Copenhagen.

Through their expertise in transportation infrastructure, Jacobs Solutions Inc (NYSE:J) and PA Consulting are poised to facilitate the evolution of the Copenhagen Metro into a more sustainable, efficient, and connected system. Their contribution will focus on strategic planning, technical insights, and innovative solutions to enhance the metro's operations and maintenance.

Urbanization in Portugal has been less pronounced compared to other European countries primarily because rapid urbanization process in the country began around the 1960s and intensified after joining the European Economic Community in 1986. However, despite a major increase in the number of housing constructions, Portugal still lags behind in urbanization rates compared to its European counterparts. For instance, between 1981 and 2011, while almost all urban territories in Portugal registered positive population variations, there were still important areas with low population density, particularly in the interior regions.

It was created by two non-governmental organizations: Human Capital Center in Ukraine (Kyiv) and Institute for Global Transformation (Brussels). The purpose of the platform is to develop mechanisms for mutually beneficial cooperation between the EU and Ukraine that would contribute to joint economic growth.

The event was supported by the Mission of Ukraine to the European Union. More than 50 guests joined the event. The event was opened by Ambassador Vsevolod Chentsov, Head of the Mission of Ukraine to the EU.

Among the guests were representatives of 18 countries, including members of the diplomatic missions of Austria, Ireland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia, Japan, Turkey, Canada, Romania and Croatia. The event was also attended by representatives of international financial institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Business Association, the Brussels Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BECI).

During UAFP's presentation in Brussels, potential cooperation between Ukraine and the EU at the diplomatic level, in the business sphere, and in the field of investment was discussed.

Lana Zerkal, a representative of the UAFP Steering Committee and a well-known diplomat, emphasized that the platform aims to facilitate a dialogue between Ukrainian businesses, Ukrainian local authorities, and European businesses. It is high-quality communication that will allow each of the parties to maximize the benefits of Ukraine's European integration.

""We understand that it is very important for regional authorities and regional elites to build relationships and be heard not only at the level of the Ukrainian government, but also to consider development strategies, to understand where they will be in 5-10 years, how European integration will change their lives and what opportunities they can take advantage of now. That is why we are joining our efforts and hope that together with others we will be able to empower and increase the ability of our economic agents to communicate, because indeed, communication is one of the key goals of this platform,"" Zerkal said.

Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, Chairman of the Board of the National Energy Company Ukrenergo, explained how Ukraine can help Europe with an additional source of energy as the demand for electricity in Europe grows. Despite Russia's destruction of its energy infrastructure, Ukraine still has the opportunity to increase electricity exports to the EU.

""We are not an energy system that just needs help. We are an energy system that can help Europe, and we can fit very well into the European strategy of energy autonomy in the future. But for that, we need to make sure that the transformation of the energy sector is happening inside Ukraine. And when we talk about the energy transformation of Ukraine, we are talking about making Ukraine the first large climate-neutral system on the continent, and maybe even in the world,"" Kudrytsky said.

Six weeks before the event, more than 200 participants have already registered and 500 to 600 are expected.

What is the difference? Decarbonisation relates to the energy and fuel sector and means replacing carbon-based fuels with electricity and hydrogen. Often, the term is used to refer to fossil CO₂ emissions, meaning that biofuels have also become part of the decarbonisation strategy.

The situation is very different in the chemicals and materials sector. Here, most intermediates and products contain embedded carbon - and are even based on carbon - which can never be replaced by anything else. In fact, this sector requires a constant and even increasing demand for carbon. It is not the chemicals and materials that can be decarbonised, only the associated process energy can. But they can be defossilised if the carbon source is not fossil carbon from the ground, i.e. not crude oil, natural gas or coal.

Defossilisation is the key point of the conference, which will focus on the three alternatives to fossil carbon from the ground: biomass, CO₂ utilisation and recycling. The unique concept of showcasing all renewable material solutions at one event hits the nail on the head and covers the entire value chain of the renewable carbon economy.

And there is a lot to do! Today, the global chemicals and plastics industry uses 550 million tonnes of embedded carbon in its products, and this amount will double by 2050. Today, 88% of this carbon comes from fossil sources, mainly oil, 8% from biomass, and only 4% from recycling and 0.04% from CCU. Numerous innovations and investments are required to increase the share of the three renewable carbon sources to almost 100%. What are the visions and strategies of industry and policy to achieve a fossil-free chemicals and materials industry?

Over three days, top speakers from industry, academia and politics will present and discuss the latest developments in strategy, technology, innovation, policy and market trends to an international audience of experts in 80 presentations, 20 panel discussions and more than ten workshops. The final program is now set and six innovations have been nominated for the award ""Renewable Material of the Year 2024"". Companies, associations and institutes are still invited to run a workshop and take part in the exhibition.

""The Renewable Materials Conference (RMC) serves as a vital platform for collaboration and knowledge exchange in the renewable materials sector,"" says Michael Carus, CEO nova-Institute, and organiser of the RMC. ""Our comprehensive approach covers the entire value chain, from alternative carbon feedstocks, the chemical industry, the materials sector, product manufacturers to brand owners and investors, making the RMC the ultimate platform for networking and partnering in the new renewable carbon economy.""

Furthermore, the conference will cover a wide range of concepts and technologies: sustainable carbon cycles, renewable refineries, and chemical recycling as well as new process technologies, i.e. technologies for the production of renewable chemicals, building blocks, polymers, plastics and fine chemicals based on renewable carbon.

In the urban quarter VILLAGE IM DRITTEN, ARE Austrian Real Estate (ARE) has joined forces with the City of Vienna, wohnfonds_wien and UBM Development (UBM) to develop approx. 2000 apartments and also offices, commercial space and educational facilities around a roughly two-hectare park, with a climate-friendly energy system.

Work on the PARK HOMES developed by ARE and UBM has now begun above ground on construction site 9B, and marketing activities are up and running. ARE CEO Hans-Peter Weiss, UBM CEO Thomas G. Winkler and HABAU CEO Hubert Wetschnig laid the foundation stone for 135 privately financed condominiums together with district representative Erich Hohenberger. The plans include compliance with DGNB Gold standards through the use of sustainable building materials, thermal activation and resource-saving energy supplies.

""The PARK HOMES in the VILLAGE IM DRITTEN will be high-quality, sustainable condominiums with a variety of layouts, directly adjoining a park. The units will be certified under DGNB Gold standards, and energy supplies - as in the entire quarter - will be provided by an innovative energy system that combines geothermal heat probes, photovoltaic equipment and district heating,"" says ARE CEO Hans-Peter Weiss.

""UBM is currently developing 1,000 apartments in Vienna with geothermal energy and photovoltaic systems - half of these together with ARE at the Village im Dritten. Living without a guilty conscience is becoming a reality,"" says Thomas G. Winkler, CEO of UBM Development AG.

""Just a short time ago we celebrated the topping out of the DOCKS, and now we're already announcing the start of construction for the PARK HOMES. 135 privately financed condominiums will soon find their new owners. I am looking forward to welcoming each and every new resident to their new home on Landstraße in the near future,"" comments Landstraße district representative Erich Hohenberger.

Living at the park

The PARK HOMES - planned by HNP architects - are situated between Adolf-Blamauer-Gasse and the corner of Leo-Perutz-Promenade, directly adjoining a roughly two-hectare park. 135 apartments are spread over eleven storeys and include various layouts for singles, couples and families ranging from two rooms with 35 square metres up to five rooms with a maximum of 166 square metres. In addition, almost all apartments will have their own private outdoor areas such as a loggia, balcony, terrace or garden.

Spaces for the community

Areas for shared use inside and outside the building aim to help residents meet up and interact. These areas include a fitness room, a communal room with terrace, a co-working space for those who wish to focus on work outside their home, and play/leisure areas for children and young people.

Use of local, renewable energy

The PARK HOMES, together with all other construction sites at the VILLAGE IM DRITTEN, will be supplied with heat, cooling and electricity via the climate-friendly, comprehensive energy concept developed for the quarter by ARE and Wien Energie. Plans call for as much energy as possible to be generated and used on site. This will be realized with a combination of 500 geothermal probes, photovoltaic equipment with a total output of over one megawatt peak, and district heating. The geothermal probes will be connected to form Austria's largest energy network. Optimal use and distribution of energy in the quarter will be supported by the start-up AMPEERS ENERGY with its equipment software for load management.

The VILLAGE IM DRITTEN quarter

Around 2,000 apartments, offices, commercial space and convenience shopping as well as childcare and educational facilities are being constructed for the VILLAGE IM DRITTEN on Vienna's Landstraße. The nearly two-hectare park in the centre of the quarter will serve as a relaxing refuge and have a positive effect on the entire neighbourhood. In addition to the nearly car-free and cycle-friendly design of the quarter, the local infrastructure will create short routes into the city centre and support the environmentally friendly handling of resources.

It's not that strict',"New to the Parish: Marharyta Pokydailo lives with her grandparents in the village of Woodford while her parents remain in Ukraine

Marharyta Pokydailo's teenage years haven't been what she expected. Aged 15 she lived in Kyiv's vibrant city centre with her parents, thriving at school and playing piano. Then Russia invaded Ukraine. Today, aged 17, she and her grandparents live in Woodford village in southeast Galway, 17km from Portumna, while her parents still live in Kyiv.

Marharyta, pronounced Margarita (sometimes called Margo in Ukraine), is known as Margaret in Woodford, where the teenager lives in Bark Hill House, a former convent-turned-rental property, now refugee accommodation. The 1903 house is home to several family groups from different areas of Ukraine. From the large sittingroom with sash windows on two sides, the gardens, woodland and rolling hills are visible.

""Before the war it was really great. We were living in the centre of Kyiv. It's a bit of a contrast here, living in a more quiet place. It's different but I love it. Sometimes I really miss the rhythm of a big city."" She enjoys visiting Dublin, and goes to Galway most weeks.

She's in fifth year in the Mercy College across the road. ""I like the school very much. I feel I integrated fairly quickly. I found lots of friends. I'm really happy in the school. The teachers are lovely. And my classmates, they're very friendly.""

[ 'Ireland is a home for my children. They wouldn't know Kenya, they know Ireland' ]

She learned English at school and, earlier, from her mother, who has ""perfect English"". At home they spoke Ukrainian, and she's fluent in Russian too: when she was small people in Kyiv spoke both languages, but ""most people stopped speaking Russian"" when Crimea was annexed, ""because people hated the actions"".

She's studying for the Leaving Cert at the Mercy but also ""attending"" her Ukrainian school, with online tutoring or solo studying, after school. Five students from her former classmates still physically attend school, the rest are scattered, in France, Austria, and ""my really good friend, he's in England"".

I hope when I finish my undergraduate education, the war will finish. I don't know where I want to live but I definitely want to help to rebuild

Her subjects in her Ukrainian school are physics, chemistry, Ukrainian history, world history, maths, English, geography, Ukrainian literature and world literature. She's doing German in her Ukrainian school, and French here, where aside from compulsory subjects she's taking physics, biology and art. This makes for a very long day, plus homework for both. She is ""really stressed for my Ukrainian final exams"", which take place this month in the Dublin embassy.

She is in a good position to compare approaches. Subjects are ""pretty similar, but especially comparing maths and physics, the Ukrainian school system is much harder. I love the Irish school system. It's much more, I don't know, not that strict. In Ireland you don't get grades every day. You just get grades for tests, once in a few months. In Ukraine, we get grades for absolutely everything, for every homework, and we're doing regular tests, really often.""

An only child, her parents, Irene and Mark Pokydailo, both work in the civil service, in law and IT. ""These are the people we need now the most probably."" Before the war, they had a comfortable middle-class life: an apartment in the city, a country house in a village nearby for summers, regular foreign holidays. ""We could afford go on a trip, buy a new car."" Her maternal grandparents lived in another city district.

""When the war started we were forced to flee Kyiv because Russian troops were near. They could come in at any time. I went with my parents and grandparents to western Ukraine for a few months. It's closer to Europe and was safer because there were no Russian troops, just explosions. There's nothing more scary than hearing the Russian troops outside Kyiv."" After ""Ukrainian fighters made Russian troops go away from Kyiv"" they spent the summer and autumn in the city. But that winter ""we had no light and no electricity and no water. It was constant blackouts in Kyiv. It was pretty much impossible to live there. There were constant bombardments that winter."" Missile attacks destroyed apartment blocks on their street and ""lots of people died in our district"".

She and her grandparents left Kyiv in January 2023, but her parents stayed. ""Mum was really worried about me. I'm the only child. She said we should go somewhere, because it's impossible to live here; all the houses nearby are destroyed. Our house could be like that. My parents, they can't leave the country, they have a job to do. They think it's important to stay and help how they can."" Her grandparents are over 70 but ""their souls are young"".

[ 'All Ukrainian refugees have lost careers, houses, friends, language, prospects' ]

They chose Ireland because it's English-speaking. ""It's important to be able to communicate. My grandma also knows English. Another reason is, we knew Irish people, they really have sympathy to Ukraine. I would say histories of Ireland and Ukraine are similar. I know how Ireland was fighting for the rights and independence, and Ukraine is also doing that now. We knew Irish people understand us.""

Before coming she knew ""a bit about Irish history. The famine, Cliffs of Moher, Trinity College, because it's really famous! In Ukraine it's much more sunny. In Ireland it's raining but I'm the kind of person who loves rain. In the winter, my freckles were gone, but now they're back again!""

It was difficult leaving her parents. ""I really miss them because I was, I am still, really close with them. We used to spend a lot of time together."" They have daily video calls.

Coming to Woodford, ""we felt really safe. It was really unusual, there were no explosions. And silence. I felt completely comfortable. It's a safe place. I love people here and really love the nature.""

There was no piano at Bark Hill, but a community of music lovers, Noelle Lynskey, director of Portumna's Shorelines Arts Festival, pianist Finghin Collins and Music For Galway helped organise the loan of a Kawai piano from Pianos Plus in Dublin. Pokydailo is delighted. ""It's really good. I really love it. It's just perfect.""

She worries for her parents. ""I am constantly reading the news, especially when I know there was an air alert."" They have electricity now, but ""they're really scared, especially when they hear explosions. They go to work every day, even though most nights they spend in the underground shelters, and they can't sleep."" She returned to see them in Ukraine last summer for two weeks. Coming back, ""it was worse"" than leaving first time.

After university ""I want to help rebuild the cities in Ukraine. I hope when I finish my undergraduate education, the war will finish. I don't know where I want to live but I definitely want to help to rebuild.

She hopes to live in Ukraine again, but ""if years will pass and I will still be in Ireland, it might be hard to decide where to live, because Ireland is becoming my second home, even after one year.""",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.07450980392156858,452754349,3,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/sh9fRQWRZJ1uOEVz_l_kLaYImO4=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/ZHAZ6CWSTJEQ7HBOZ5CVPJVZHI.jpg,

Copper is one of those substances we take for granted -- until we start adding new wiring to the house, looking for a power cord to the children's computer, or maybe buying antique copper pots.

Or, malevolently, when someone cuts the wires from your car battery to your spark plugs.

But copper is a key element (an actual element; periodic table symbol Cu) in the evolution of how the world migrates from the World Wide Web to artificial intelligence.

Related: Silver is shining brighter than gold this year

This year, money has been moving into copper as part of the continuum of the process that results in power generation.

And the demand for power generation is growing because of all the energy needed for data centers, where artificial intelligence applications are trained and live.

Getting power to where it needs to be requires generators, transmission lines, transformers, switches, regulators, and and various measuring devices, and that means miles and miles of wiring connecting everything together.

That wiring is made of copper.

Copper: A long history with humans

Copper has been part of human life for thousands of years.

An axe with a copper blade was found with the mummified body of Ötzi, whose 5,200-year-old remains were found in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991.

The blade was sharpened regularly, but it was low technology. Ötzi may well have known that copper was too soft a metal for a weapon.

Later, artisans combined copper with tin and other metals to make a stronger metal -- bronze. They also used copper in ceramics, paints and other products.

Copper: a gift to economic development

Since the 19th century, people involved in developing electric utilities have known that copper has another important attraction. It's a terrific conductor of electricity beloved by power companies because it's relatively cheap.

The journey for copper starts at the mine when ore is extracted. The ore is crushed and run through chemical baths to become a concentrate, which is ultimately smelted into the red metal we know today and processed into those miles and miles of wiring.

It has one big drawback. Finding decent deposits means searching all over the globe.

Copper: welcome appreciation from investors

As of May 3, the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is up more than 17% this year. The Chicago close on May 3 was $4.557 a pound, up 1.6% on the day but down 2.9% from a 52-week high of $4.695 on April 30.

The U.S. Copper Index Fund (CPER) , organized to invest in the metal, is up 17.5% on the year.

But copper, like any industrial commodity, gets hammered in a slowdown. It fell below $2 a pound in 2008 during the financial crisis and to $2.16 in 2020 during the pandemic.

Mining company stocks are also up this year. The Global X Copper Miners exchange-traded fund (COPX) is up 24.4% this year -- 9.9% so far in the second quarter.

The ETF's holdings include giants like Newmont (NEM) , Anglo-American (NGLOY) , Brazilian-based Vale (VALE) , and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX) .

So far, Anglo-American is the biggest winner in the group. Its U.S. shares are up 45% in 2024.

Freeport-McMoRan shares are up 18.5% and 7.3% so far in the second quarter.

One of the world's largest copper producers, Freeport has the Grasberg complex as its primary source in the mountains of New Guinea in eastern Indonesia.

The complex is located just 2 1/2 miles (4 km) west of the 16,024-foot Puncak Jaya, the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

For nearly 30 years, in a hostile physical, natural, and complicated-and-often-unsavory political environment, Freeport produced billions of pounds of copper at Grasberg. And from the copper ore, the Grasberg deposits have yielded millions of ounces of gold -- as a byproduct.

The open-pit mine is a mile wide and more than 1,800 feet deep. It can be seen from space.

Those deposits are largely played out. Freeport-McMoRan is now extracting its ores from veins it found deep underground.

Copper: Boom-and-bust cycles

To be sure, copper is subject to boom-and-bust cycles.

A slump in China that began with the Covid-19 pandemic depressed the country's need for copper. That left copper prices stagnating for several years.

It's true that mining copper -- or any mineral -- is, at the very least, a messy business involving the destruction of local environments, the creation of fantastic amounts of waste, and the use of toxic chemicals.

But copper is an essential material needed to build and expand modern economies. That helps explain why China has consumed as much as 30% of global production.

Copper's gains are good for copper companies, investors, miners (theoretically), technology companies, and even for consumer health in trace amounts.

And heaven knows, Tesla (TSLA) , all the Chinese electric-vehicle makers and companies rushing to make EVs need copper wiring.

That assumes enough copper can be produced to meet what's expected to be strong -- if not soaring -- demand at least over the next few years and probably longer.

In fact, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that the company expected to buy 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units by the end of the year.

That means demand for more copper because one H100 GPU uses some 700 MW of power per year. That's roughly the same as a typical house.

And Nvidia is shipping these units as fast as its manufacturing teams can make them and is getting ready to produce a new generation of faster GPUs.

Its next-generation GPU, code-named Blackwell, will have 208 billion transistors and will be faster, less costly to operate, and more energy efficient, the company promises. The H100 unit has only 80 billion transistors.

How does that translate into power demand?

Developers of a data center proposed for the Portland, Ore., area forecast needing 60 megawatts of power a year, enough to power 45,000 home annually, the Post said. The developers are now looking at ""off-the-grid, high-tech fuel cells that convert natural gas into low-emissions electricity.""

Electric utilities are reworking their forecasts of power demand. They now expect they will need much more power to meet the demand from the massive data center developers.

These centers run 24 hours a day to power the computers and the cooling systems needed to prevent servers from overheating and crashing.

So, that means more demand for copper.

By the end of 2023, Schneider Electric, (SBGSY,) the French specialist in digital automation and energy management problems, estimated that the power required to run artificial intelligence facilities was as big as all the power consumed on the island of Cyprus.

And it's growing at a compounded rate of 26% to 36% a year.

This means that what's being used now will double in just a few years, and data centers alone will use as much power as Iceland.

And that means more demand for copper.

Copper: Could demand outstrip supply?

Sounds great for the producers and refiners of copper. However, the demand might prove so great that it will outstrip both copper production and the ability of power companies to deliver electricity.

Analysts at Citigroup say global demand for copper will exceed global production this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The shortfall will last for the next three years.

Plans for new data centers already under construction in North Virginia mean stretched capacity for local utilities -- the equivalent of several nuclear plants, the Washington Post reported.

Georgia is so worried about power shortages it's rethinking offering data center developers incentives to locate facilities there.

Still and all, it's possible that the fears of power shortages won't materialize.

Projects can get delayed by permitting processes, environmental reviews, and, of course, lawsuits.

Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others have armies of engineers who figure out how to minimize the power demands of their GPUs.

But all that means is that the demand for copper will be strong in the foreseeable future. It may not grow as fast as enthusiasts think, but it will be steady at the very least.

That means more demand for copper, and potentially, higher prices.

This year, money has been moving into copper as part of the continuum of the process that results in power generation.

And the demand for power generation is growing because of all the energy needed for data centers, where artificial intelligence applications are trained and live.

Getting power to where it needs to be requires generators, transmission lines, transformers, switches, regulators, and and various measuring devices, and that means miles and miles of wiring connecting everything together.

That wiring is made of copper.

Developers of a data center proposed for the Portland, Ore., area forecast needing 60 megawatts of power a year, enough to power 45,000 home annually, the Post said. The developers are now looking at ""off-the-grid, high-tech fuel cells that convert natural gas into low-emissions electricity.""

Electric utilities are reworking their forecasts of power demand. They now expect they will need much more power to meet the demand from the massive data center developers.

These centers run 24 hours a day to power the computers and the cooling systems needed to prevent servers from overheating and crashing.

So, that means more demand for copper.

By the end of 2023, Schneider Electric, (SBGSY,) the French specialist in digital automation and energy management problems, estimated that the power required to run artificial intelligence facilities was as big as all the power consumed on the island of Cyprus.

And it's growing at a compounded rate of 26% to 36% a year.

This means that what's being used now will double in just a few years, and data centers alone will use as much power as Iceland.

Sounds great for the producers and refiners of copper. However, the demand might prove so great that it will outstrip both copper production and the ability of power companies to deliver electricity.

Analysts at Citigroup say global demand for copper will exceed global production this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The shortfall will last for the next three years.

Plans for new data centers already under construction in North Virginia mean stretched capacity for local utilities -- the equivalent of several nuclear plants, the Washington Post reported.

This year, money has been moving into copper as part of the continuum of the process that results in power generation.

And the demand for power generation is growing because of all the energy needed for data centers, where artificial intelligence applications are trained and live.

Getting power to where it needs to be requires generators, transmission lines, transformers, switches, regulators, and and various measuring devices, and that means miles and miles of wiring connecting everything together.

Copper has been part of human life for thousands of years.

An axe with a copper blade was found with the mummified body of Ötzi, whose 5,200-year-old remains were found in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991.

The blade was sharpened regularly, but it was low technology. Ötzi may well have known that copper was too soft a metal for a weapon.

Later, artisans combined copper with tin and other metals to make a stronger metal -- bronze. They also used copper in ceramics, paints and other products.

Copper: a gift to economic development

Since the 19th century, people involved in developing electric utilities have known that copper has another important attraction. It's a terrific conductor of electricity beloved by power companies because it's relatively cheap.

The journey for copper starts at the mine when ore is extracted. The ore is crushed and run through chemical baths to become a concentrate, which is ultimately smelted into the red metal we know today and processed into those miles and miles of wiring.

It has one big drawback. Finding decent deposits means searching all over the globe.

Copper: welcome appreciation from investors

As of May 3, the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is up more than 17% this year. The Chicago close on May 3 was $4.557 a pound, up 1.6% on the day but down 2.9% from a 52-week high of $4.695 on April 30.

The U.S. Copper Index Fund (CPER) , organized to invest in the metal, is up 17.5% on the year.

But copper, like any industrial commodity, gets hammered in a slowdown. It fell below $2 a pound in 2008 during the financial crisis and to $2.16 in 2020 during the pandemic.

Mining company stocks are also up this year. The Global X Copper Miners exchange-traded fund (COPX) is up 24.4% this year -- 9.9% so far in the second quarter.

The ETF's holdings include giants like Newmont (NEM) , Anglo-American (NGLOY) , Brazilian-based Vale (VALE) , and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX) .

So far, Anglo-American is the biggest winner in the group. Its U.S. shares are up 45% in 2024.

Freeport-McMoRan shares are up 18.5% and 7.3% so far in the second quarter.

One of the world's largest copper producers, Freeport has the Grasberg complex as its primary source in the mountains of New Guinea in eastern Indonesia.

The complex is located just 2 1/2 miles (4 km) west of the 16,024-foot Puncak Jaya, the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

For nearly 30 years, in a hostile physical, natural, and complicated-and-often-unsavory political environment, Freeport produced billions of pounds of copper at Grasberg. And from the copper ore, the Grasberg deposits have yielded millions of ounces of gold -- as a byproduct.

The open-pit mine is a mile wide and more than 1,800 feet deep. It can be seen from space.

Those deposits are largely played out. Freeport-McMoRan is now extracting its ores from veins it found deep underground.

Copper: Boom-and-bust cycles

To be sure, copper is subject to boom-and-bust cycles.

A slump in China that began with the Covid-19 pandemic depressed the country's need for copper. That left copper prices stagnating for several years.

It's true that mining copper -- or any mineral -- is, at the very least, a messy business involving the destruction of local environments, the creation of fantastic amounts of waste, and the use of toxic chemicals.

But copper is an essential material needed to build and expand modern economies. That helps explain why China has consumed as much as 30% of global production.

Copper's gains are good for copper companies, investors, miners (theoretically), technology companies, and even for consumer health in trace amounts.

And heaven knows, Tesla (TSLA) , all the Chinese electric-vehicle makers and companies rushing to make EVs need copper wiring.

That assumes enough copper can be produced to meet what's expected to be strong -- if not soaring -- demand at least over the next few years and probably longer.

More on forces affecting markets

In fact, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that the company expected to buy 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units by the end of the year.

That means demand for more copper because one H100 GPU uses some 700 MW of power per year. That's roughly the same as a typical house.

And Nvidia is shipping these units as fast as its manufacturing teams can make them and is getting ready to produce a new generation of faster GPUs.

Its next-generation GPU, code-named Blackwell, will have 208 billion transistors and will be faster, less costly to operate, and more energy efficient, the company promises. The H100 unit has only 80 billion transistors.

The ETF's holdings include giants like Newmont (NEM) , Anglo-American (NGLOY) , Brazilian-based Vale (VALE) , and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX) .

So far, Anglo-American is the biggest winner in the group. Its U.S. shares are up 45% in 2024.

Freeport-McMoRan shares are up 18.5% and 7.3% so far in the second quarter.

One of the world's largest copper producers, Freeport has the Grasberg complex as its primary source in the mountains of New Guinea in eastern Indonesia.

The complex is located just 2 1/2 miles (4 km) west of the 16,024-foot Puncak Jaya, the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

For nearly 30 years, in a hostile physical, natural, and complicated-and-often-unsavory political environment, Freeport produced billions of pounds of copper at Grasberg. And from the copper ore, the Grasberg deposits have yielded millions of ounces of gold -- as a byproduct.

The open-pit mine is a mile wide and more than 1,800 feet deep. It can be seen from space.

Those deposits are largely played out. Freeport-McMoRan is now extracting its ores from veins it found deep underground.

Copper: Boom-and-bust cycles

To be sure, copper is subject to boom-and-bust cycles.

A slump in China that began with the Covid-19 pandemic depressed the country's need for copper. That left copper prices stagnating for several years.

It's true that mining copper -- or any mineral -- is, at the very least, a messy business involving the destruction of local environments, the creation of fantastic amounts of waste, and the use of toxic chemicals.

But copper is an essential material needed to build and expand modern economies. That helps explain why China has consumed as much as 30% of global production.

Copper's gains are good for copper companies, investors, miners (theoretically), technology companies, and even for consumer health in trace amounts.

And heaven knows, Tesla (TSLA) , all the Chinese electric-vehicle makers and companies rushing to make EVs need copper wiring.

That assumes enough copper can be produced to meet what's expected to be strong -- if not soaring -- demand at least over the next few years and probably longer.

In fact, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that the company expected to buy 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units by the end of the year.

That means demand for more copper because one H100 GPU uses some 700 MW of power per year. That's roughly the same as a typical house.

And Nvidia is shipping these units as fast as its manufacturing teams can make them and is getting ready to produce a new generation of faster GPUs.

Its next-generation GPU, code-named Blackwell, will have 208 billion transistors and will be faster, less costly to operate, and more energy efficient, the company promises. The H100 unit has only 80 billion transistors.

How does that translate into power demand?

Developers of a data center proposed for the Portland, Ore., area forecast needing 60 megawatts of power a year, enough to power 45,000 home annually, the Post said. The developers are now looking at ""off-the-grid, high-tech fuel cells that convert natural gas into low-emissions electricity.""

Electric utilities are reworking their forecasts of power demand. They now expect they will need much more power to meet the demand from the massive data center developers.

These centers run 24 hours a day to power the computers and the cooling systems needed to prevent servers from overheating and crashing.

So, that means more demand for copper.

By the end of 2023, Schneider Electric, (SBGSY,) the French specialist in digital automation and energy management problems, estimated that the power required to run artificial intelligence facilities was as big as all the power consumed on the island of Cyprus.

And it's growing at a compounded rate of 26% to 36% a year.

This means that what's being used now will double in just a few years, and data centers alone will use as much power as Iceland.

Sounds great for the producers and refiners of copper. However, the demand might prove so great that it will outstrip both copper production and the ability of power companies to deliver electricity.

Analysts at Citigroup say global demand for copper will exceed global production this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The shortfall will last for the next three years.

Plans for new data centers already under construction in North Virginia mean stretched capacity for local utilities -- the equivalent of several nuclear plants, the Washington Post reported.

Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others have armies of engineers who figure out how to minimize the power demands of their GPUs.

But all that means is that the demand for copper will be strong in the foreseeable future. It may not grow as fast as enthusiasts think, but it will be steady at the very least.

That means more demand for copper, and potentially, higher prices.

This year, money has been moving into copper as part of the continuum of the process that results in power generation.

And the demand for power generation is growing because of all the energy needed for data centers, where artificial intelligence applications are trained and live.

Getting power to where it needs to be requires generators, transmission lines, transformers, switches, regulators, and and various measuring devices, and that means miles and miles of wiring connecting everything together.

Copper has been part of human life for thousands of years.

An axe with a copper blade was found with the mummified body of Ötzi, whose 5,200-year-old remains were found in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991.

The blade was sharpened regularly, but it was low technology. Ötzi may well have known that copper was too soft a metal for a weapon.

Later, artisans combined copper with tin and other metals to make a stronger metal -- bronze. They also used copper in ceramics, paints and other products.

Copper: a gift to economic development

Since the 19th century, people involved in developing electric utilities have known that copper has another important attraction. It's a terrific conductor of electricity beloved by power companies because it's relatively cheap.

The journey for copper starts at the mine when ore is extracted. The ore is crushed and run through chemical baths to become a concentrate, which is ultimately smelted into the red metal we know today and processed into those miles and miles of wiring.

It has one big drawback. Finding decent deposits means searching all over the globe.

Copper: welcome appreciation from investors

As of May 3, the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is up more than 17% this year. The Chicago close on May 3 was $4.557 a pound, up 1.6% on the day but down 2.9% from a 52-week high of $4.695 on April 30.

This year, money has been moving into copper as part of the continuum of the process that results in power generation.

And the demand for power generation is growing because of all the energy needed for data centers, where artificial intelligence applications are trained and live.

Getting power to where it needs to be requires generators, transmission lines, transformers, switches, regulators, and and various measuring devices, and that means miles and miles of wiring connecting everything together.

Copper has been part of human life for thousands of years.

An axe with a copper blade was found with the mummified body of Ötzi, whose 5,200-year-old remains were found in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991.

The blade was sharpened regularly, but it was low technology. Ötzi may well have known that copper was too soft a metal for a weapon.

Later, artisans combined copper with tin and other metals to make a stronger metal -- bronze. They also used copper in ceramics, paints and other products.

Copper: a gift to economic development

Since the 19th century, people involved in developing electric utilities have known that copper has another important attraction. It's a terrific conductor of electricity beloved by power companies because it's relatively cheap.

The journey for copper starts at the mine when ore is extracted. The ore is crushed and run through chemical baths to become a concentrate, which is ultimately smelted into the red metal we know today and processed into those miles and miles of wiring.

It has one big drawback. Finding decent deposits means searching all over the globe.

Copper: welcome appreciation from investors

As of May 3, the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is up more than 17% this year. The Chicago close on May 3 was $4.557 a pound, up 1.6% on the day but down 2.9% from a 52-week high of $4.695 on April 30.

The U.S. Copper Index Fund (CPER) , organized to invest in the metal, is up 17.5% on the year.

But copper, like any industrial commodity, gets hammered in a slowdown. It fell below $2 a pound in 2008 during the financial crisis and to $2.16 in 2020 during the pandemic.

Mining company stocks are also up this year. The Global X Copper Miners exchange-traded fund (COPX) is up 24.4% this year -- 9.9% so far in the second quarter.

The ETF's holdings include giants like Newmont (NEM) , Anglo-American (NGLOY) , Brazilian-based Vale (VALE) , and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX) .

So far, Anglo-American is the biggest winner in the group. Its U.S. shares are up 45% in 2024.

Freeport-McMoRan shares are up 18.5% and 7.3% so far in the second quarter.

One of the world's largest copper producers, Freeport has the Grasberg complex as its primary source in the mountains of New Guinea in eastern Indonesia.

The complex is located just 2 1/2 miles (4 km) west of the 16,024-foot Puncak Jaya, the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

For nearly 30 years, in a hostile physical, natural, and complicated-and-often-unsavory political environment, Freeport produced billions of pounds of copper at Grasberg. And from the copper ore, the Grasberg deposits have yielded millions of ounces of gold -- as a byproduct.

The open-pit mine is a mile wide and more than 1,800 feet deep. It can be seen from space.

Those deposits are largely played out. Freeport-McMoRan is now extracting its ores from veins it found deep underground.

Copper: Boom-and-bust cycles

To be sure, copper is subject to boom-and-bust cycles.

A slump in China that began with the Covid-19 pandemic depressed the country's need for copper. That left copper prices stagnating for several years.

It's true that mining copper -- or any mineral -- is, at the very least, a messy business involving the destruction of local environments, the creation of fantastic amounts of waste, and the use of toxic chemicals.

But copper is an essential material needed to build and expand modern economies. That helps explain why China has consumed as much as 30% of global production.

Copper's gains are good for copper companies, investors, miners (theoretically), technology companies, and even for consumer health in trace amounts.

And heaven knows, Tesla (TSLA) , all the Chinese electric-vehicle makers and companies rushing to make EVs need copper wiring.

That assumes enough copper can be produced to meet what's expected to be strong -- if not soaring -- demand at least over the next few years and probably longer.

More on forces affecting markets

In fact, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that the company expected to buy 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units by the end of the year.

That means demand for more copper because one H100 GPU uses some 700 MW of power per year. That's roughly the same as a typical house.

And Nvidia is shipping these units as fast as its manufacturing teams can make them and is getting ready to produce a new generation of faster GPUs.

Its next-generation GPU, code-named Blackwell, will have 208 billion transistors and will be faster, less costly to operate, and more energy efficient, the company promises. The H100 unit has only 80 billion transistors.

How does that translate into power demand?

Developers of a data center proposed for the Portland, Ore., area forecast needing 60 megawatts of power a year, enough to power 45,000 home annually, the Post said. The developers are now looking at ""off-the-grid, high-tech fuel cells that convert natural gas into low-emissions electricity.""

Electric utilities are reworking their forecasts of power demand. They now expect they will need much more power to meet the demand from the massive data center developers.

These centers run 24 hours a day to power the computers and the cooling systems needed to prevent servers from overheating and crashing.

So, that means more demand for copper.

By the end of 2023, Schneider Electric, (SBGSY,) the French specialist in digital automation and energy management problems, estimated that the power required to run artificial intelligence facilities was as big as all the power consumed on the island of Cyprus.

And it's growing at a compounded rate of 26% to 36% a year.

This means that what's being used now will double in just a few years, and data centers alone will use as much power as Iceland.

Sounds great for the producers and refiners of copper. However, the demand might prove so great that it will outstrip both copper production and the ability of power companies to deliver electricity.

Analysts at Citigroup say global demand for copper will exceed global production this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The shortfall will last for the next three years.

Plans for new data centers already under construction in North Virginia mean stretched capacity for local utilities -- the equivalent of several nuclear plants, the Washington Post reported.

Georgia is so worried about power shortages it's rethinking offering data center developers incentives to locate facilities there.

Still and all, it's possible that the fears of power shortages won't materialize.

Projects can get delayed by permitting processes, environmental reviews, and, of course, lawsuits.

Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others have armies of engineers who figure out how to minimize the power demands of their GPUs.

But all that means is that the demand for copper will be strong in the foreseeable future. It may not grow as fast as enthusiasts think, but it will be steady at the very least.

That means more demand for copper, and potentially, higher prices.

That means demand for more copper because one H100 GPU uses some 700 MW of power per year. That's roughly the same as a typical house.

And Nvidia is shipping these units as fast as its manufacturing teams can make them and is getting ready to produce a new generation of faster GPUs.

Its next-generation GPU, code-named Blackwell, will have 208 billion transistors and will be faster, less costly to operate, and more energy efficient, the company promises. The H100 unit has only 80 billion transistors.

How does that translate into power demand?

Developers of a data center proposed for the Portland, Ore., area forecast needing 60 megawatts of power a year, enough to power 45,000 home annually, the Post said. The developers are now looking at ""off-the-grid, high-tech fuel cells that convert natural gas into low-emissions electricity.""

Electric utilities are reworking their forecasts of power demand. They now expect they will need much more power to meet the demand from the massive data center developers.

These centers run 24 hours a day to power the computers and the cooling systems needed to prevent servers from overheating and crashing.

So, that means more demand for copper.

By the end of 2023, Schneider Electric, (SBGSY,) the French specialist in digital automation and energy management problems, estimated that the power required to run artificial intelligence facilities was as big as all the power consumed on the island of Cyprus.

And it's growing at a compounded rate of 26% to 36% a year.

This means that what's being used now will double in just a few years, and data centers alone will use as much power as Iceland.

Sounds great for the producers and refiners of copper. However, the demand might prove so great that it will outstrip both copper production and the ability of power companies to deliver electricity.

Analysts at Citigroup say global demand for copper will exceed global production this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The shortfall will last for the next three years.

Plans for new data centers already under construction in North Virginia mean stretched capacity for local utilities -- the equivalent of several nuclear plants, the Washington Post reported.

Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others have armies of engineers who figure out how to minimize the power demands of their GPUs.

That means more demand for copper, and potentially, higher prices.

This year, money has been moving into copper as part of the continuum of the process that results in power generation.

And the demand for power generation is growing because of all the energy needed for data centers, where artificial intelligence applications are trained and live.

Getting power to where it needs to be requires generators, transmission lines, transformers, switches, regulators, and and various measuring devices, and that means miles and miles of wiring connecting everything together.

Copper has been part of human life for thousands of years.

An axe with a copper blade was found with the mummified body of Ötzi, whose 5,200-year-old remains were found in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991.

The blade was sharpened regularly, but it was low technology. Ötzi may well have known that copper was too soft a metal for a weapon.

Later, artisans combined copper with tin and other metals to make a stronger metal -- bronze. They also used copper in ceramics, paints and other products.

Copper: a gift to economic development

Since the 19th century, people involved in developing electric utilities have known that copper has another important attraction. It's a terrific conductor of electricity beloved by power companies because it's relatively cheap.

The journey for copper starts at the mine when ore is extracted. The ore is crushed and run through chemical baths to become a concentrate, which is ultimately smelted into the red metal we know today and processed into those miles and miles of wiring.

It has one big drawback. Finding decent deposits means searching all over the globe.

Copper: welcome appreciation from investors

As of May 3, the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is up more than 17% this year. The Chicago close on May 3 was $4.557 a pound, up 1.6% on the day but down 2.9% from a 52-week high of $4.695 on April 30.

The U.S. Copper Index Fund (CPER) , organized to invest in the metal, is up 17.5% on the year.

But copper, like any industrial commodity, gets hammered in a slowdown. It fell below $2 a pound in 2008 during the financial crisis and to $2.16 in 2020 during the pandemic.

Mining company stocks are also up this year. The Global X Copper Miners exchange-traded fund (COPX) is up 24.4% this year -- 9.9% so far in the second quarter.

The ETF's holdings include giants like Newmont (NEM) , Anglo-American (NGLOY) , Brazilian-based Vale (VALE) , and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX) .

So far, Anglo-American is the biggest winner in the group. Its U.S. shares are up 45% in 2024.

Freeport-McMoRan shares are up 18.5% and 7.3% so far in the second quarter.

One of the world's largest copper producers, Freeport has the Grasberg complex as its primary source in the mountains of New Guinea in eastern Indonesia.

The complex is located just 2 1/2 miles (4 km) west of the 16,024-foot Puncak Jaya, the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

For nearly 30 years, in a hostile physical, natural, and complicated-and-often-unsavory political environment, Freeport produced billions of pounds of copper at Grasberg. And from the copper ore, the Grasberg deposits have yielded millions of ounces of gold -- as a byproduct.

The open-pit mine is a mile wide and more than 1,800 feet deep. It can be seen from space.

Those deposits are largely played out. Freeport-McMoRan is now extracting its ores from veins it found deep underground.

Copper: Boom-and-bust cycles

To be sure, copper is subject to boom-and-bust cycles.

A slump in China that began with the Covid-19 pandemic depressed the country's need for copper. That left copper prices stagnating for several years.

It's true that mining copper -- or any mineral -- is, at the very least, a messy business involving the destruction of local environments, the creation of fantastic amounts of waste, and the use of toxic chemicals.

But copper is an essential material needed to build and expand modern economies. That helps explain why China has consumed as much as 30% of global production.

Copper's gains are good for copper companies, investors, miners (theoretically), technology companies, and even for consumer health in trace amounts.

And heaven knows, Tesla (TSLA) , all the Chinese electric-vehicle makers and companies rushing to make EVs need copper wiring.

That assumes enough copper can be produced to meet what's expected to be strong -- if not soaring -- demand at least over the next few years and probably longer.

The U.S. Copper Index Fund (CPER) , organized to invest in the metal, is up 17.5% on the year.

But copper, like any industrial commodity, gets hammered in a slowdown. It fell below $2 a pound in 2008 during the financial crisis and to $2.16 in 2020 during the pandemic.

Mining company stocks are also up this year. The Global X Copper Miners exchange-traded fund (COPX) is up 24.4% this year -- 9.9% so far in the second quarter.

The ETF's holdings include giants like Newmont (NEM) , Anglo-American (NGLOY) , Brazilian-based Vale (VALE) , and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX) .

So far, Anglo-American is the biggest winner in the group. Its U.S. shares are up 45% in 2024.

Freeport-McMoRan shares are up 18.5% and 7.3% so far in the second quarter.

One of the world's largest copper producers, Freeport has the Grasberg complex as its primary source in the mountains of New Guinea in eastern Indonesia.

The complex is located just 2 1/2 miles (4 km) west of the 16,024-foot Puncak Jaya, the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

For nearly 30 years, in a hostile physical, natural, and complicated-and-often-unsavory political environment, Freeport produced billions of pounds of copper at Grasberg. And from the copper ore, the Grasberg deposits have yielded millions of ounces of gold -- as a byproduct.

The open-pit mine is a mile wide and more than 1,800 feet deep. It can be seen from space.

Those deposits are largely played out. Freeport-McMoRan is now extracting its ores from veins it found deep underground.

Copper: Boom-and-bust cycles

To be sure, copper is subject to boom-and-bust cycles.

A slump in China that began with the Covid-19 pandemic depressed the country's need for copper. That left copper prices stagnating for several years.

It's true that mining copper -- or any mineral -- is, at the very least, a messy business involving the destruction of local environments, the creation of fantastic amounts of waste, and the use of toxic chemicals.

But copper is an essential material needed to build and expand modern economies. That helps explain why China has consumed as much as 30% of global production.

Copper's gains are good for copper companies, investors, miners (theoretically), technology companies, and even for consumer health in trace amounts.

And heaven knows, Tesla (TSLA) , all the Chinese electric-vehicle makers and companies rushing to make EVs need copper wiring.

That assumes enough copper can be produced to meet what's expected to be strong -- if not soaring -- demand at least over the next few years and probably longer.

In fact, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that the company expected to buy 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units by the end of the year.

That means demand for more copper because one H100 GPU uses some 700 MW of power per year. That's roughly the same as a typical house.

And Nvidia is shipping these units as fast as its manufacturing teams can make them and is getting ready to produce a new generation of faster GPUs.

Its next-generation GPU, code-named Blackwell, will have 208 billion transistors and will be faster, less costly to operate, and more energy efficient, the company promises. The H100 unit has only 80 billion transistors.

How does that translate into power demand?

Developers of a data center proposed for the Portland, Ore., area forecast needing 60 megawatts of power a year, enough to power 45,000 home annually, the Post said. The developers are now looking at ""off-the-grid, high-tech fuel cells that convert natural gas into low-emissions electricity.""

Electric utilities are reworking their forecasts of power demand. They now expect they will need much more power to meet the demand from the massive data center developers.

These centers run 24 hours a day to power the computers and the cooling systems needed to prevent servers from overheating and crashing.

So, that means more demand for copper.

By the end of 2023, Schneider Electric, (SBGSY,) the French specialist in digital automation and energy management problems, estimated that the power required to run artificial intelligence facilities was as big as all the power consumed on the island of Cyprus.

And it's growing at a compounded rate of 26% to 36% a year.

This means that what's being used now will double in just a few years, and data centers alone will use as much power as Iceland.

Sounds great for the producers and refiners of copper. However, the demand might prove so great that it will outstrip both copper production and the ability of power companies to deliver electricity.

Analysts at Citigroup say global demand for copper will exceed global production this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The shortfall will last for the next three years.

Plans for new data centers already under construction in North Virginia mean stretched capacity for local utilities -- the equivalent of several nuclear plants, the Washington Post reported.

Georgia is so worried about power shortages it's rethinking offering data center developers incentives to locate facilities there.

Still and all, it's possible that the fears of power shortages won't materialize.

Projects can get delayed by permitting processes, environmental reviews, and, of course, lawsuits.

Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others have armies of engineers who figure out how to minimize the power demands of their GPUs.

But all that means is that the demand for copper will be strong in the foreseeable future. It may not grow as fast as enthusiasts think, but it will be steady at the very least.

That means more demand for copper, and potentially, higher prices.

This year, money has been moving into copper as part of the continuum of the process that results in power generation.

And the demand for power generation is growing because of all the energy needed for data centers, where artificial intelligence applications are trained and live.

Getting power to where it needs to be requires generators, transmission lines, transformers, switches, regulators, and and various measuring devices, and that means miles and miles of wiring connecting everything together.

That wiring is made of copper.

Copper: A long history with humans

Copper has been part of human life for thousands of years.

An axe with a copper blade was found with the mummified body of Ötzi, whose 5,200-year-old remains were found in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991.

The blade was sharpened regularly, but it was low technology. Ötzi may well have known that copper was too soft a metal for a weapon.

Later, artisans combined copper with tin and other metals to make a stronger metal -- bronze. They also used copper in ceramics, paints and other products.

Copper: a gift to economic development

Since the 19th century, people involved in developing electric utilities have known that copper has another important attraction. It's a terrific conductor of electricity beloved by power companies because it's relatively cheap.

The journey for copper starts at the mine when ore is extracted. The ore is crushed and run through chemical baths to become a concentrate, which is ultimately smelted into the red metal we know today and processed into those miles and miles of wiring.

It has one big drawback. Finding decent deposits means searching all over the globe.

Projects can get delayed by permitting processes, environmental reviews, and, of course, lawsuits.

Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others have armies of engineers who figure out how to minimize the power demands of their GPUs.

But all that means is that the demand for copper will be strong in the foreseeable future. It may not grow as fast as enthusiasts think, but it will be steady at the very least.

That means more demand for copper, and potentially, higher prices.

Or, malevolently, when someone cuts the wires from your car battery to your spark plugs.

But copper is a key element (an actual element; periodic table symbol Cu) in the evolution of how the world migrates from the World Wide Web to artificial intelligence.

Related: Silver is shining brighter than gold this year

This year, money has been moving into copper as part of the continuum of the process that results in power generation.

And the demand for power generation is growing because of all the energy needed for data centers, where artificial intelligence applications are trained and live.

Getting power to where it needs to be requires generators, transmission lines, transformers, switches, regulators, and and various measuring devices, and that means miles and miles of wiring connecting everything together.

That wiring is made of copper.

Copper has been part of human life for thousands of years.

An axe with a copper blade was found with the mummified body of Ötzi, whose 5,200-year-old remains were found in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991.

The blade was sharpened regularly, but it was low technology. Ötzi may well have known that copper was too soft a metal for a weapon.

Later, artisans combined copper with tin and other metals to make a stronger metal -- bronze. They also used copper in ceramics, paints and other products.

Since the 19th century, people involved in developing electric utilities have known that copper has another important attraction. It's a terrific conductor of electricity beloved by power companies because it's relatively cheap.

The journey for copper starts at the mine when ore is extracted. The ore is crushed and run through chemical baths to become a concentrate, which is ultimately smelted into the red metal we know today and processed into those miles and miles of wiring.

It has one big drawback. Finding decent deposits means searching all over the globe.

As of May 3, the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is up more than 17% this year. The Chicago close on May 3 was $4.557 a pound, up 1.6% on the day but down 2.9% from a 52-week high of $4.695 on April 30.

The U.S. Copper Index Fund (CPER) , organized to invest in the metal, is up 17.5% on the year.

But copper, like any industrial commodity, gets hammered in a slowdown. It fell below $2 a pound in 2008 during the financial crisis and to $2.16 in 2020 during the pandemic.

Mining company stocks are also up this year. The Global X Copper Miners exchange-traded fund (COPX) is up 24.4% this year -- 9.9% so far in the second quarter.

The ETF's holdings include giants like Newmont (NEM) , Anglo-American (NGLOY) , Brazilian-based Vale (VALE) , and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX) .

So far, Anglo-American is the biggest winner in the group. Its U.S. shares are up 45% in 2024.

Freeport-McMoRan shares are up 18.5% and 7.3% so far in the second quarter.

One of the world's largest copper producers, Freeport has the Grasberg complex as its primary source in the mountains of New Guinea in eastern Indonesia.

The complex is located just 2 1/2 miles (4 km) west of the 16,024-foot Puncak Jaya, the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.

For nearly 30 years, in a hostile physical, natural, and complicated-and-often-unsavory political environment, Freeport produced billions of pounds of copper at Grasberg. And from the copper ore, the Grasberg deposits have yielded millions of ounces of gold -- as a byproduct.

The open-pit mine is a mile wide and more than 1,800 feet deep. It can be seen from space.

Those deposits are largely played out. Freeport-McMoRan is now extracting its ores from veins it found deep underground.

To be sure, copper is subject to boom-and-bust cycles.

A slump in China that began with the Covid-19 pandemic depressed the country's need for copper. That left copper prices stagnating for several years.

It's true that mining copper -- or any mineral -- is, at the very least, a messy business involving the destruction of local environments, the creation of fantastic amounts of waste, and the use of toxic chemicals.

But copper is an essential material needed to build and expand modern economies. That helps explain why China has consumed as much as 30% of global production.

Copper's gains are good for copper companies, investors, miners (theoretically), technology companies, and even for consumer health in trace amounts.

And heaven knows, Tesla (TSLA) , all the Chinese electric-vehicle makers and companies rushing to make EVs need copper wiring.

That assumes enough copper can be produced to meet what's expected to be strong -- if not soaring -- demand at least over the next few years and probably longer.

More on forces affecting markets

In fact, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that the company expected to buy 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units by the end of the year.

That means demand for more copper because one H100 GPU uses some 700 MW of power per year. That's roughly the same as a typical house.

And Nvidia is shipping these units as fast as its manufacturing teams can make them and is getting ready to produce a new generation of faster GPUs.

Its next-generation GPU, code-named Blackwell, will have 208 billion transistors and will be faster, less costly to operate, and more energy efficient, the company promises. The H100 unit has only 80 billion transistors.

How does that translate into power demand?

Developers of a data center proposed for the Portland, Ore., area forecast needing 60 megawatts of power a year, enough to power 45,000 home annually, the Post said. The developers are now looking at ""off-the-grid, high-tech fuel cells that convert natural gas into low-emissions electricity.""

Electric utilities are reworking their forecasts of power demand. They now expect they will need much more power to meet the demand from the massive data center developers.

These centers run 24 hours a day to power the computers and the cooling systems needed to prevent servers from overheating and crashing.

So, that means more demand for copper.

By the end of 2023, Schneider Electric, (SBGSY,) the French specialist in digital automation and energy management problems, estimated that the power required to run artificial intelligence facilities was as big as all the power consumed on the island of Cyprus.

And it's growing at a compounded rate of 26% to 36% a year.

This means that what's being used now will double in just a few years, and data centers alone will use as much power as Iceland.

And that means more demand for copper.

Sounds great for the producers and refiners of copper. However, the demand might prove so great that it will outstrip both copper production and the ability of power companies to deliver electricity.

Analysts at Citigroup say global demand for copper will exceed global production this year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The shortfall will last for the next three years.

Plans for new data centers already under construction in North Virginia mean stretched capacity for local utilities -- the equivalent of several nuclear plants, the Washington Post reported.

The small sphere, which the Norway-based company officially calls a ""neuron,"" has drawn nicknames like ""magic ball"" or ""orb."" Whatever the name, electric cooperative Great River Energy plans to install 52 of these round devices as a way to ease one of the toughest problems facing the modern energy sector: Electric utilities are running out of space on transmission lines to transport a growing amount of wind power and other energy. While more power lines are in the works, those infrastructure upgrades are often expensive.

The Heimdall technology aims to let more power flow along existing wires, which Great River believes could delay major infrastructure work and save its customers money. The nonprofit provides electricity for roughly 1.7 million people through 27 mostly rural cooperatives, ranging from northeast Minnesota to the Iowa border.

Priti Patel, vice president of transmission for Great River, said the orbs ""can unlock untapped capacity,"" and no utility in the country has made a bigger bet on the product.

Pilot project promotion

Great River tested the neurons first, trying out four of them last year in the Morris area. That pilot project found information the sensors provided could allow 42.8% more electricity to flow down a power line.

""If you can increase capacity, ability for these lines to transmit electricity, which is going to be increasingly and predominantly clean electricity, 40% is a big deal,"" said Allen Gleckner, executive lead of policy and programs for the St. Paul-based nonprofit Fresh Energy.

Jørgen Festervoll, CEO of Heimdall, said most utilities have to operate their grids conservatively, restricting them typically 20-40% below actual capacity limits.

The Heimdall neurons monitor the temperature of the line, whether it is sagging, and other data like weather conditions.

""Without software and sensors like this showing the actual temperature on the line, it's like driving without a speedometer,"" Festervoll said. ""And when you're driving critical infrastructure, you do not want to speed, you want to be on the safe side.""

That was fine in the past, he said. But power grids are facing the challenge of handling an influx of renewable energy -- far from where consumers use the electricity -- and rising demand for electricity due in part to electric vehicles and data centers.

Heimdall has 40 customers in 17 countries, including its biggest agreement for 270 neurons in Austria. But Great River has the largest U.S. project.

Boosting capacity

Great River's orbs will be on a handful of transmission lines spaced through about 150 miles, mainly in north-central Minnesota. Patel said a study revealing some of the most congested areas of the state that are limiting wind power and other energy sources helped determine the location.

Patel declined to say how much the 52 orbs would cost but said the technology will help avoid spending on other projects. Exactly what kind of savings Great River can expect is still up in the air, too. It won't end the need for any new transmission lines, but it could allow Great River to skip line upgrades or other work and use that money on meeting Minnesota's carbon-free standard or other projects, Patel said.

More wind power can save customers money, too, because it's cheaper to produce.

""We are confident that after early next year when we get the results in that it will help us potentially delay some projects, and a delay of even a few years is monumental to a cooperative,"" she said.

The Heimdall technology is only one way to boost power line capacity, a topic that has drawn growing interest in Minnesota.

A group of power line operators that includes Great River, Xcel Energy, Minnesota Power and Otter Tail Power is working on 19 congestion relief projects worth $130 million.

Xcel has used ""dynamic line ratings,"" which are in the same family of technology as the Heimdall orbs, to boost transmission capacity.

Democrats who control the Minnesota House this week voted to approve policies aimed at better understanding and evaluating congestion and the potential for ""grid enhancing technology"" to ease that crunch.

Gleckner said Minnesota still needs transmission projects. Recently, the regional grid operator announced a gargantuan new plan to build more than a dozen new transmission lines across the Midwest with a price tag that could top $20 billion.

But Gleckner said the relatively new Heimdall orbs and technology like it could gain steam, and utilities could adopt them more widely if they can replicate promising results.

Verbund AG (OEZVY) recently announced a dividend of $0.16 per share, payable on 2024-05-28, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-05-07. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Verbund AG's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.

Founded in 1947 through a nationalization act, Verbund is the leading power producer in Austria. The Austrian state owns 51% of its capital. Hydro accounts for more than 90% of the total power output. Hydro power is generated from reservoirs and pumped storage plants in the Austrian Alps, and run-of-river plants in Austria and southern Germany. Total hydro capacity amounts to 8.4 GW. Verbund also owns the Austrian electricity grid through its fully owned subsidiary AP. In 2021, the firm acquired 51% of Gas Connect Austria, a gas transmission and distribution system operator. The group also owns one CCGT and is involved in trading and development of wind and solar capacity.

Verbund AG has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2019. Dividends are currently distributed on a yearly basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.

As of today, Verbund AG currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.35% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.62%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Verbund AG's annual dividend growth rate was 52.40%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to 39.40% per year. And over the past decade, Verbund AG's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 13.80%.

Based on Verbund AG's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Verbund AG stock as of today is approximately 17.63%.

To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Verbund AG's dividend payout ratio is 0.40. Verbund AG's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Verbund AG's profitability 9 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.

To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Verbund AG's growth rank of 9 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Verbund AG's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Verbund AG's revenue has increased by approximately 44.70% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 85.14% of global competitors. The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Verbund AG's earnings increased by approximately 44.90% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 79.62% of global competitors. Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 38.90%, which outperforms approximately 84.88% of global competitors.

With a robust dividend payment record, impressive growth metrics, and strong financial health, Verbund AG stands out as a potentially lucrative opportunity for dividend-seeking investors. The company's future dividend prospects look promising, supported by its strategic investments in renewable energy and consistent financial performance. For investors looking to enhance their portfolio with high-yield opportunities, Verbund AG offers a compelling case.

As one of the three original elements, lithium is found throughout our atmosphere. The sun, stars, and meteorites burn brightly with the flame of this highly reactive element. On earth, lithium remains a major mineral component of granite rock, and also lingers in significant amounts in sea water, mineral springs, and soils. Lithium has also found its way into our cell phones, electric cars, and holiday fireworks. Every organ and tissue in the human body contains the mineral lithium, with particular importance in brain health.

Today, we do not tend to think of lithium as an essential mineral in human physiology and its critical use for expanding technology. Lithium does not evoke visions of stars, peaceful rivers, or strong, healthy bodies. Instead images of lithium are associated with pharmacies, doctor's offices, and back wards of psychiatric hospitals. Lithium is perceived, almost exclusively, as a dangerous drug used to treat severe mental illness with incapacitating side effects.

In a recent review in the New York Times titled ""I Don't Believe in God, but I Believe in Lithium,"" author Jamie Lowe delivered a powerful testimony of her dramatic response to lithium - the drug that alleviated her mania and allowed her to live a normal, happy life. Her article also describes the kidney damage that has forced her to stop lithium and placed her on a waiting list for potential kidney transplant. She provides a unique insight into the life-changing prescriptive benefits of lithium, and the overwhelming fear she has of life without her lithium; a life without her sanity.

I have treated thousands of patients with similar backgrounds as Jamie's. This raised the question, how can a medicine provide such life-changing effects on mental health yet cause permanent damage to kidney and often thyroid function?

Twenty-five years ago, I attempted to answer this question by looking for the lowest dose of lithium that would alleviate symptoms. Rather than basing my prescription dosage on a number from a lab test that dictated a ""therapeutic blood level,"" I listened to my patients. I began to see that patients on a lower dose of lithium - doses closer to the trace amounts found naturally in the environment - still experienced significant clinical results.

Psychiatry has much to learn from the untold story of one of its oldest drugs.

Lithium as Mineral

Lithium was given its official name by a Swedish chemist named Johan August Arfvedson in 1817. He isolated the element while studying petalite - a rich mineral deposit found in soils - on the remote island of Uto. The unique substance was named lithium after the Greek word lithos, meaning literally ""from stone.""

Just one year after its initial discovery, researchers noticed that there was something special about this new element. Lithium ore, when ground into a fine powder, turned flames a bright crimson color that intensified to a dazzling white when burning strongly. In addition to being highly reactive, the metal was also lightweight, malleable, and a good conductor of heat and electricity. These characteristics made lithium an immediately desirable commodity for industrial and manufacturing purposes. Since this time it has been used for manifold applications: in aircraft parts, fireworks, heat-resistant cookware, focal lenses, and even the fusion material in power plants. Today, the mineral is most commonly used for building the lithium-ion batteries that power our cell phones, tablets, laptops, and eco-friendly vehicles.

Over the past two centuries, scientists have gained a deeper appreciation of this alkali earth metal, which is now known to be relatively common in the earth's upper crust. As the 27th most abundant element, it can be found in rock sediments, salt flats, and mineral springs at varying concentrations throughout the globe. The largest deposits of lithium are salars, or vast saline basins in the deserts of South America. Lithium is also highly concentrated in clay beds and hard rock underground mines dotting Australia, China, and some parts of North America.

Lithium is in fact so ubiquitous in these environments that it can readily be found in food and water supplies. The US Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the daily lithium intake of an average adult ranges from about 0.65 mg to 3 mg. Grains and vegetables serve as the primary sources of lithium in a standard diet, with animal byproducts such as eggs and milk providing the rest. Lithium has even been officially added to the World Health Organization'slist of nutritionally essential trace elements alongside zinc, iodine, and others.

The most frequent source of lithium in the modern diet, however, is tap water. Depending on geographical location, drinking water contains substantial amounts of naturally occurring lithium. According to environmental surveys, water with high mineral content can translate to 2 mg or so of lithium per day.

There has been little research on the specific consequences of lithium deficiency in humans. However, trials in which animals have been put on low-lithium diets have revealed a gross decrease in reproductive function, lifespan, and lipid metabolism. It is quite possible that lithium deficiency has many other effects on human physiology, but the study of nutritional lithium has been overshadowed by the volatile reputation of high-dose pharmaceutical lithium.

Lithium as Medicine

Official documentation of the medical applications of lithium was first publicized by London doctor Alfred Baring Garrod, who used it to treat patients with gout. After discovering uric acid in the blood of his patients with gout, he wrote about pioneering the use of lithium in his 1859 treatise, The Nature and Treatment of Gout and Rheumatic Gout. Between the 1850s and 1890s, several other physicians experimented with lithium treatment because at the time uric acid was viewed as a critical factor in many diseases.

Both the medical literature and popular advertisements of the time abounded with praise for lithium. The Sears, Roebuck & Company Catalogue of 1908 advertised Schieffelin's Effervescent Lithia Tablets for a variety of uric acid afflictions. By 1907, The Merck Index listed 43 different medicinal preparations containing lithium. Even soft drink entrepreneur Charles Leiper Grigg understood that there was something special about lithium. In 1929, he unveiled a drink called Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda with the slogan ""It takes the ouch out of the grouch."" Hailed for improving mood and curing hangovers, this product was eventually rechristened 7 Up. The ""7"" supposedly represents the rounded-up atomic weight of the element lithium (6.9), and the ""Up"" suggests its power to lift spirits. Lithium remained an ingredient of 7 Up until 1950.

An Australian psychiatrist, Dr. John Cade, is credited with first experimenting with high doses of lithium citrate and lithium carbonate as a treatment for manic depressive illness in 1949. He observed first in animals and then in human trials that lithium stabilized mood, restored memory, and improved cognitive function, even in his most challenging subjects. Because of his well-structured study and the dramatic results, some historians of medicine consider that Cade ushered in modern psychopharmacology.

Unfortunately, the timing of Cade's treatment successes was ill fated. The very same year, 1949, adverse reaction reports surfaced in the media about patients who were taking lithium chloride in the US. As physicians encouraged patients with heart disease and hypertension to avoid sodium chloride, lithium chloride was marketed as an alternative to sodium chloride in four different preparations: Salti-salt, Milosal, Foodsal, and Westsal. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, physicians around the country released reports of patients who developed lithium poisoning after they had used large, uncontrolled amounts of Westsal. Several deaths were also reported, leading the FDA to ban the use of lithium salt substitutes. ""Stop using this dangerous poisoning at once!"" exhorted the FDA. Lithium fell out of favor in the American medical community.

Despite this lithium chloride debacle, trials testing the efficacy of lithium carbonate for mania continued in Australia and France. Eventually the research from other countries became so compelling that by the end of the decade, a ""lithium underground"" had formed of US physicians prescribing lithium in the absence of official FDA approval. Finally, the FDA sanctioned lithium in 1970 as a new investigational drug for use in treatment of acute mania. By this time many other countries had already approved lithium, including France, the UK, Germany, and Italy. In 1974, lithium was finally approved to prevent recurrent mania.

Since the official FDA approval of pharmaceutical-dose lithium, the mineral has proved to be one of the most versatile and successful drugs in psychiatry. According to treatment guidelines, lithium carbonate is recognized as the first-line therapy in patients with bipolar disorder. Recent meta-analyses underscore the superiority of lithium as a prophylactic for both mania and depression. Lithium's effectiveness in suicide prevention has also been demonstrated. While antidepressants may treat depression, they often exacerbate symptoms of agitation, restlessness, irritability, and anger that can lead to impulsivity and aggression. Lithium, by contrast, has specific effects against suicide that are independent of mood stabilization. Substantial literature also exists to support the use of lithium in a broad spectrum of other neurological conditions including substance abuse, violent and aggressive behavior, ADHD, and cognitive decline.

The pharmacological mechanisms under which lithium operates have yet to be understood in totality, although many well-supported hypotheses exist. It appears that lithium functions in two central ways in the body's neurochemistry: repairing damaged neurons and stimulating neuronal growth. Proposed mechanisms for lithium's effect on balancing mood include the altering of dopamine, glutamate, and GABA levels in the synapses as well as modulation of secondary messenger pathways that effect neurotransmission, including the adenylyl cyclase system, cAMP signaling pathway, and phosphoinositide system. Accumulating evidence has shown that lithium's diverse neuroprotective actions involve direct changes in the expression of multiple genes.

It was once believed that genes were destiny. Scientists and clinicians held fast to the idea that a fixed genetic code was hardwired in humans at conception, and that mutations were a sure predictor of disease. However, it is now known that environmental factors have a profound influence on the ways in which genes are expressed. The study of epigenetics has revealed that lifestyle factors, including physical activity, learning, stress exposure, and pharmacological compounds, can essentially switch genes on or off. The mineral lithium is a powerful epigenetic factor. Key epigenetic mechanisms include histone modifications and changes in DNA methylation. Lithium works in both of these channels and has been shown to influence the expression of over 50 different genes. Working in these epigenetic pathways, lithium supports a wide range of neuroprotective and neurotrophic actions that literally change brain physiology.

Low-Dose Lithium

I believe that lithium is the most effective medication in psychiatry. Psychiatrists over the years have been hesitant to prescribe lithium because it is toxic at pharmaceutical doses. Concerns about side effects and toxicity are nonexistent when lithium is used as a nutritional, low-dose supplement. The untapped potential of low-dose lithium in psychiatry has implications for dramatically changing clinical practice with a safe, integrative strategy for the treatment of mental illness.

I have treated children as young as 4 years old and adults in their 70s with low-dose lithium. Here are a few examples of the hundreds of patients in whom this treatment has been successful.

A 4-year-old boy, Peter, had severe ADHD. Even at this young age, he was shunned by other children, and his parents were asked to remove him from preschool. It was easy to observe his aggressive behaviors in my office. A trace mineral analysis from a hair sample revealed no detectable lithium. I prescribed 250 mcg of lithium in liquid form. Peter's annoying aggressiveness diminished. He became able to make friends, and eventually he began to participate cooperatively with other children in a new preschool.

Shawn at age 8 was often in trouble for bullying. Although he had been diagnosed with ADHD, stimulants had not been helpful. His trace mineral analysis showed no detectable lithium. On 2 mg of lithium orotate, he showed significant improvement, and he lost interest in bullying other children.

A 20-year-old patient, Amy, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She had been doing better on Depakote, although she continued to have anger outbursts and uncontrolled rages. Although she had once been on prescription lithium, she had experienced side effects that prevented ongoing use. I prescribed 10 mg of lithium for her in conjunction with the Depakote. Her condition improved so much that she was able to leave a therapeutic boarding school to return home.

A middle-aged man named Brian made an appointment with me to talk about his problems with anger and irritability. I had no trouble imagining these problems, as I was unavoidably 15 minutes late in calling him to my office. He berated me for most of the session, and I later heard that he had been verbally abusive with my staff. Brian, I learned, had suffered from depression and was currently taking an antidepressant, but his irritability remained. His wife reported that his road rage escalated to such intensity that he would get out of the car and yell at other drivers. I added 10 mg of lithium to Brian's antidepressant treatment. Both he and his wife later reported that his simmering road rage subsided to nothing more than mild frustration.

The case of my patient Patricia was revealing by all of my assessment strategies: clinical history, family history, and trace mineral analysis. A 43-year-old therapist, she had been diagnosed at age 18 with depression and alcohol abuse. I learned from her story that her family of origin was deeply impaired by alcoholism. Patricia had been taking an antidepressant and had worked hard at maintaining her sobriety for 10 years. She came to me for enhanced support, as she complained that she was a ""dry drunk,"" clinging to ""white-knuckle sobriety."" She felt chronically irritable. Trace mineral analysis revealed some level of lithium in her hair, but it was low.

Six weeks after I prescribed 5 mg of lithium, Patricia came to my office in tears. She was partly joyful that she no longer felt a constant level of irritability, but she also realized with regret what it must have been like for her family to have tolerated her irritability and anger for such a long time.

In an effort to organize and disseminate the information of low-dose lithium, I have started to compile additional case studies and ongoing research efforts on the website www.lowdoselithium.org.

In 1970, one research study analyzed levels of organically derived lithium in the water of 27 Texan counties and compared them to the incidence of admissions and readmissions for psychoses, neuroses, and personality disorders at local state mental hospitals. Data from a 2-year period were collected and analyzed. The authors noticed a marked trend: the higher the lithium content in the water supply, the lower the rate of psychiatric illness in that county. This association remained significant even after correcting for possible confounding variables such as population density and distance to the nearest state hospitals.

A follow-up study in the same Texan counties looked at similar variables over a longer 9-year span. Researchers came up with almost identical results: the incidences of suicide, homicide, and rape were significantly higher in counties where drinking water contained little or no lithium, versus those with levels ranging from 70 to 170 mcg/L. Unsure if these striking findings were somehow unique to that geographical region, other researchers have sought to replicate the study template in other areas throughout the globe. Lithium water studies have now been repeated internationally at sites in Austria, England, Greece, and Japan. Overall the collection has revealed a strong inverse correlation between aggressive crime and suicide and supplemental levels of lithium in the water supply.

Another interesting finding came from a study that looked at lithium levels in the hair of criminals. Trace mineral hair analysis is one of the most accurate methods for testing long-term mineral status and is therefore highly advantageous for determining where deficiencies are present. This study found that violent criminals had little to no stores of lithium when tested via hair mineral analysis, bringing forth the idea that perhaps lithium deficiency was contributing to oppositional and aggressive behaviors.

The most fascinating research recently, however, has been on the use of lithium for Alzheimer's disease. Given its being the only cause of death in the top 10 in America that cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed, researchers are spending billions of dollars on Alzheimer's disease. There is a fast-growing community of researchers suggesting that lithium may provide significant benefits in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's.

Lithium has been shown to disrupt the key enzyme responsible for the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease. This enzyme is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is important in neural growth and development. Notably, specific levels of GSK-3 are required to carry out the synaptic remodeling that drives memory formation.

In Alzheimer's disease, GSK-3 becomes hyperactive in the areas of the brain controlling memory and behavior, including the hippocampus and frontal cortex. This upregulation spurs GSK-3 to phosphorylate, or activate, amyloid-B and tau proteins in the neurons of these regions at an aberrantly high rate. Over time these proteins accumulate to create the signature plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that disrupt the brain tissue and result in symptoms of cognitive decline. Lithium works as a direct GSK-3 inhibitor to prevent this overexpression, halting inappropriate amyloid production and the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins before they impair brain function.

In addition to protecting the brain from the development of plaques and tangles, lithium has been shown to repair existing damages brought about by Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Lithium ions, for example, encourage the synthesis and release of key neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which in turn stimulate the growth and repair of neurons. Patients on lithium have been found to have significantly higher gray matter volumes in the brain. One study has even directly demonstrated that damaged nerve cells exposed to lithium respond with increases in dendritic number and length.

In a recent trial published in Current Alzheimer's Research, a nutritional dose of just 300 mcg of lithium was administered to Alzheimer's patients for 15 months. When compared with the control, those on low-dose lithium showed significant improvements in cognitive markers after just 3 months of treatment. Furthermore, these protective effects appeared to strengthen as the study proceeded, with many of the lithium-treated individuals showing marked cognitive improvements by the end of the trial. These results suggest that lithium could be a viable treatment for Alzheimer's disease when used at low doses over the long term.

Dr. Nassir Ghaemi, one of the more notable and respected advocates of lithium use in the medical community, recently published a review in 2014 in Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry summarizing the benefits of low-dose lithium therapy. Ghaemi and his colleagues performed a systematic review of 24 clinical, epidemiological, and biological reports that assessed standard or low-dose lithium for dementia along with other behavioral or medical benefits. Five of the seven epidemiological studies established a correlation with standard-dose lithium therapy and low dementia rates, while four other randomized clinical trials demonstrated that low-dose lithium yielded more benefit for patients with Alzheimer's dementia versus placebo. Based on these findings, Ghaemi stressed that ""lithium is, by far, the most proven drug to keep neurons alive, in animals and in humans, consistently and with many replicated studies.""

The Future of Lithium

Recognizing that nutrition is key to brain health is a fundamental premise of integrative medicine. Instead of focusing on just one type of intervention, integrative medicine tries to address all factors that may contribute to a mental disorder - bringing together nutritional supplements, medicines, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes.

Lithium must be recognized as a critical component of nutritional assessments. Lithium is an underused nutritional supplement. The diverse neuroprotective mechanisms are truly remarkable. The scientific literature has shown that lithium modulates GSK-3, enhances the release of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, and promotes epigenetic changes that resets the trajectory of mental illness. Lithium is powerful, reliable, cost effective, and, at low doses, completely safe.

With low-dose lithium, we have a safe nutritional supplement that is effective in treating a wide range of disabling symptoms of mental illness. Perhaps in the future, patients like Jamie Lowe, the author of the New York Times article, will not be forced to make a decision between mental and physical health. The compelling and growing scientific literature on the benefits of low-dose lithium therapy combined with over 25 years of clinical practice have convinced me that with low-dose lithium, it is entirely possible to have both.

This enabled Texas by itself to provide a natural gas lifeline to Europe after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine destabilized energy markets, in part due to a near ten percent decline in Russian oil and gas production.

The U.S. could then export significant gas supplies because the U.S. produces 13.3 million barrels a day of crude oil, and 17 million barrels a day of crude oil and condensates, the highest ever, a result in large part due to the new technology of fracking.

The benefits of ""drill, baby, drill"" are clear. The U.S. in 2023 annually produced 180 million more barrels of oil than the previous 2019 peak. However, with growth in population of 15 million people, and GDP growth of $5.1 trillion, and oil supplies up only 3.6%, oil prices still shot up.

Despite increased U.S. production, sanctions on Russian did initially take oil off the market. But the other reason why oil prices have also shot up by 50% despite increased U.S. supply is that since 2021 there have been 200 executive actions taken by the U.S. government to preclude further enhanced coal, oil and gas production, largely as part of a policy of getting to zero net greenhouse gases by 2035.

And this occurred even though the U.S. already cut back significantly on green-house gas emissions. For example, gas production in the Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico has surged 345% while methane emissions have been already cut 76%. Fully meeting methane emission goals in the area would fulfill the reductions needed to meet the overall requirement for keeping global temperatures low, including for example, Exxon's plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.

The pursuit of lower fossil fuel production in the U.S. impedes Ukraine's war effort. Since 2021, West Texas U.S. crude oil prices climbed from $60/b to $83/b to where they are today. Pump prices also surged to over $3.50 a gallon on average, nearly a 50% increase compared to 2019.

This, in turn, was a key part of the nearly 20% increase in the cost of essentials since 2021, which also led to the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, to where an average mortgage now requires a 7% loan rate rather than 3% in 2021.

Why would the U.S. government not seek to keep oil and gas production high and inflation low, particularly with a national election coming up where inflation and the cost of living are high on the concern of many Americans? With lower energy prices, Americans might be more willing to help Ukraine even as the country seeks a sound energy policy consistent with both environmental standards and robust economic growth.

However, even more importantly, a sound U.S. energy strategy could help the U.S. win the war against Russia and simultaneously place Ukraine at the center of a new invigorated energy policy (1) transforming Ukraine into an independent energy gas station for all of Europe and (2) eliminating the leverage Mocow seeks in enhancing Europe's dependence on energy supplies from Russia, most notably natural gas to Germany.

The strategic situation is Europe involves more than Ukraine. Much evidence has recently appeared confirming that beyond its aggression against Ukraine Russia is waging war against Europe as a whole. Apart from military operations in Ukraine, many NATO members now warn about Russian military attacks against other European states within 3-5 years. On top of Russian military attacks massive Russian information and espionage operations against Europe are occurring regularly.

However, the bedrock instrument of Russian policy for the last generation has been its energy penetration of Europe that provides the financial basis for its other operations and in many cases leads directly into the political-economic subversion of governments from Germany, Italy, and Austria through the Balkans into Belarus and Ukraine.

One major example of the process whereby dependence upon Russian energy translates into Russian political warfare is Moldova. Lacking its own indigenous energy sources and having already been victimized in 1992 by Moscow's seizure of its province Transnistria (the land beyond the Dniester River), Moldova has been the target of repeated Russian efforts to destroy its sovereignty and integrity for over 30 years.

Indeed, in 2023 Russia apparently planned a coup there just as it tried to attack it in 2014 during the seizure of Crimea. In all of Moscow's pressure against Moldova it has taken that state's energy dependence upon Russia as the point of departure for all of its probes and as a basis for financing these operations.

Balkan coups led by Russian agents either in Russia or in countries like Transnistria are a regular tactic of the Russian government. Russia instigated coups in Macedonia, Montenegro in 2015-16 and evidently attempted to stage another coup in Bulgaria in 2016 using the extensive influence it has gained there. Outgoing Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov has just commented that we should ""expect Russia to do 'whatever possible'"" to preserve its influence here.

Here too Russian leverage begins with energy. In Bulgaria, leaked documents have repeatedly confirmed Russia's concealed control over the Turk Stream pipeline bringing Russian gas from Türkiye to Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary. As the Center for the Study of Democracy in Bulgaria reported in 2020, also on the basis of leaked corporate documents, since 2019, before construction of this pipeline began, Russia was using Saudi, Belarussian and European companies to evade U.S. sanctions against the Turk Stream pipeline. Consequently, Russia ships the gas, builds the pipeline, and finances it through proxy entities.

The proper response to this war on Europe must go beyond the resolute, regular, consistent, and decisive provision of the weaponry Ukraine needs to win, i.e., restore its integrity and realize its full sovereignty. Whether Ukraine can achieve these objectives has come under serious question recently, but however the outcome the U.S. and its allies' strategy must also comprise a permanent reduction of European energy dependence upon Russia, an objective fully within the U.S. capability.

Both these replies to Moscow are not only feasible but also must necessarily form parts of a coherent strategy, something to which the Biden Administration seems to be allergic or at least unable to put forward. For example, Moldova's ability to ward off Russian pressures begins with ridding itself of Russian energy leverage. To the degree that it has currently done so it has utilized foreign energy sources and EU subsidies. This is clearly inadequate for the long term. But there are viable alternatives that can be brought into play for Moldova and for much if not all of the Balkans.

The pipelines bringing Russian gas to Moldova traverse Ukraine in conformity with long-standing agreements between Moscow and Kyiv. However, since Europe is scheduled to eliminate all Russian gas by 2027, including LNG, and stocks for 2025 are already abundant, Ukraine now feels it can safely terminate its contract with Gazprom to bring oil to the Balkans and Eastern Europe through pipelines located in Ukraine. Ukraine, despite the war, has been on and off exporting electricity to states like Romania since the war began and the advent of peace could certainly see a regeneration of those exports. Moreover, should its energy capabilities be restored it can then utilize the existing pipeline infrastructure to export considerable amounts of hydrocarbons or other energy sources to the Balkans. Such visions may seem far-fetched or even utopian when Russia is now pulverizing whatever it can of Ukraine's energy sector, in the context of Ukraine's necessary strikes on Russian oil refineries.

Nevertheless, those strikes also reflect Russia's growing alarm that its own energy sector is being targeted and at risk of being excluded from its natural historical market, Europe. Indeed, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov now complains that the West wants to defeat Russia to oust it from energy markets, showing Russia's concerns about being supplanted by a revived Ukraine.

These factors duly suggest the requisite course of action to negate Russia's aerial power and offensive while also strengthening Moldova and other Balkan countries and reducing Russia's energy presence in the Balkans. In the military domain transferring the air defense capabilities to Ukraine that enable it to negate Russian attacks on its energy and electrical infrastructure and armed forces will not only diminish the likelihood of a successful Russian ground and air offensive but also rehabilitate that infrastructure and spur energy production.

Providing these capabilities would also enhance Kyiv's threat to Crimea and the Russian energy facilities that Russia illegally seized there in 2014. Ukraine can also use the respite provided by these weapons to begin delivering energy to Moldova or Romania and throughout the Balkans. By transferring weapons to Ukraine that it desperately needs (now that the assistance package has passed the House of Representatives), Ukraine can relatively quickly address its requirements and those of the Balkans to enhance stability and security while also defeating Russia's political warfare in the Balkans.

While these moves are being made and before their impact makes itself felt in Ukraine and the Balkans; we need to continue to ensure the ongoing supply of energy to states like Moldova, using American energy. U.S. gas supplies are the biggest in the world, and continued exports of LNG remain a critical ingredient to help reformulate U.S. security policy, which should start with a reversal of the administration's ban on new permit for LNG exports.

At the same time we should be employing all the means of power at our disposal to create a new energy order for Europe to promote the long-term diversification of energy suppliers to Europe and the concurrent revival of energy infrastructure and connectivity promised by programs like the Three Seas Initiative. This program is ideally suited to undertake the long-term economic and energy integration of all of Eastern Europe, including the Balkans and Ukraine among others, by fostering new means of connectivity and new infrastructure, prominently including energy pipelines from the Baltic to the Black Sea. But it requires strong diplomatic and economic support to move forward. Otherwise, it will fail to realize its potential and we will lose a strong instrument that can help build a stabler, more secure, and enduring European order.

China and India are growing greenhouse gas emissions (1.3 b/tons) from 2020-2 that exceed by 120% what the U.S. eliminated between 20007-2022 (1 b/tons) by a factor of 130%. And in Europe, with gas and coal declining markedly after an initial increase at the time of the Ukraine war, and despite a 19% record drop in GHG emissions, failure to have sufficient substitutes for Russian natural gas has seen wood and biomass burning increase in Europe where it is now 60% of ""renewables."" On the other hand, U.S. energy production especially oil and natural gas, can make the U.S. the swing world producer and markedly reduce the leverage of both OPEC and Russia.

Certainly, if such an initiative recovers its momentum, it will provide a basis for expanding Ukraine's energy ties, including Ukrainian energy exports of fossil fuels, electricity, nuclear power, and green energy to all of its neighbors, including Moldova. In that event we will have taken a major step, utilizing our military assistance, energy capabilities, and diplomatic strategy towards providing and executing a well-conceived and truly strategic conception to strengthen Ukraine, undermine Russian economic and military capabilities, and intensify European integration.

All three of those outcomes contribute materially to the long-standing American interest in what President George H.W. Bush memorably called a Europe whole and free.

Moreover, all these actions are now easily within our reach. What is needed is decisive strategic leadership to act according to this strategic plan. Russia's aggression against Ukraine represents not only a crisis but a once in a generation opportunity to advance vital American interests for which we fought three wars (including the Cold War), and we can do so with peaceful means. For too long we have acted without a strategy for victory, and if we continue to squander this opportunity neither history nor future generations will forgive us.

Now the other part of the story is that our ally Ukraine wants to curtail Russian, not U.S., oil, and gas production to impede Russia's war machine. But some within the Administration are pushing Ukraine not to attack Russian refineries. Apparently, the administration believes if Russian oil and gas supply are harmed, energy prices would rise even higher to say nothing of whether such attacks on Russian soil would trigger Putin's often threatened escalation to the use of nuclear weapons.

Ironically, despite sanctions, Russia surprisingly produces 10.7mb/d of crude today, very close to the production in 2022 of 11.3mb/d. With prices 50% higher, however, Russian revenue is $7 billion a month higher or annually $84 billion higher than in 2021. This enables Moscow to better fund the war against Ukraine.

Therefore, if the U.S. wants to defeat the Russians and secure a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine territory, a key strategy (as President Reagan implemented) must certainly include curtailing Russian energy production, as nearly two-thirds of revenue to the Russian government comes from oil and gas sales.

Russian oil production at the time of the 2022 invasion was 11.3 million barrels a day while the EIA projects Russian production for all of 2024 will remain at 10.7 million barrels a day, the third largest in the world. Energy sanctions apparently have not done enough to deter Russia because they do not yet appear to be effective. This is also because Russia has reoriented its sales to China, Turkye and India, while evading sanctions by using unregistered and uninsured tankers for transport, dropping exports to Europe from 20 million cubic meters per month to 4 million.

Sanctions were designed to punish Russia and keep its energy revenue down, but pushing Ukraine not to attack Russian oil refineries moves in the opposite direction, keeping Russian oil and gas production and supply as well as revenues high. At the same time, the U.S. Administration is also spending hundreds of billions to keep U.S. reliable fossil fuel production down but more unreliable renewable energy production up.

One of President Reagan's key measures was to dramatically increase U.S. (and Saudi) oil production to significantly lower the prices of oil and gas and literally take away multiple tens of billions of dollars from the Soviet exchequer.

At the time, oil and gas exports were the most important source of foreign exchange for the entire Soviet government, along with arms sales. Lowering oil prices from today's $83-7/barrel to even $60 would substantially cut Moscow's revenue.

The U.S. has the resources to increase the world-wide oil and gas supply significantly, even if Russian domestic energy production were curtailed by Ukraine attacks. Thus, both U.S. energy policy and U.S. Ukraine war strategy illustrate how an all of government approach requires the left and right hand to work in sync rather in contradiction to each other.

However, one views global climate change and the role of fossil fuel production, you cannot reduce access to U.S. energy sources from where currently 60% of all electricity comes and expect prices not to stimulate inflation and then interest rates with a deleterious impact on the U.S. economy. This, in turn, makes it more difficult for Congress to appropriate billions to support Ukraine's defense. On top of which, natural gas can substitute for call and improve the environment simultaneously.

As Robert Zubrin wrote many years ago, from 1974 through 2008, every major spike in U.S. oil prices has been followed by a recession in the United States. For the U.S. with a $34 trillion debt now that is accumulating at $1 trillion every 90-100 days, bringing inflation down and interest rates as well is important. The U.S. in 2023 paid more in interest payments on the debt than we spent for the entire U.S. Department of Defense. To prevent further economic erosion, the U.S. must increase its own oil and gas production if simultaneously the U.S. wants to curtail Russian production as a deterrent strategy against Russia.

However, when the United States pushes against Ukraine attacks against Russian energy facilities, a key part of Ukraine toolbox is taken away, allowing Russian domestic production, and refining as well as exports of oil and gas to continue. Although not exporting as much to Europe compared to 2022, Russia exports more oil and gas now to India, China, and Türkiye, all of whom have pushed aside sanctions against purchasing Russian energy, while the previous assumptions of declining tanker availability have also not been borne out.

One recent report concludes ""Russia, along with other countries not participating in sanctions, have established shipping services designed to avoid G7 sanctions and price caps, leading to more export outlets being available to Russia.... we expect Russia's production to average 10.7 million b/d in 2023 and remain mostly unchanged in 2024.""

Whatever the U.S. thought sanctions would do to help the war to stop Russian aggression, our energy policy has left Russian oil and gas production only marginally reduced (1.3mb/d vs. 10.7 mb/d) and generated U.S. inflation at over 20% since 2021. This is not a sound policy and needs to be overhauled.

Let's not deceive ourselves Canadian winters rarely end when the calendar says they should end.

This German-Austrian invention was used intermittently in many countries during the following decades but it was definitely revived during the energy crisis of the early 1970s becoming more or less a global phenomenon today. In our case -- like many other things in which the Canadian elites are mindless followers -- we have simply adapted our clocks to the dictates of the Americans.

The rationale for DST is that advancing the clock one hour when supposedly there is more daylight would save energy, especially electricity since during the summer months the evenings would have more natural light. The claims of electricity savings are however highly contested, in fact there is no conclusive evidence that such energy savings really occur. That is particularly true in the case of Canada. Unlike the United States where generally the winters are shorter due to their geographic location, Canada being much more to the north doesn't enjoy a significant increase in daylight by this time of the year; that may come by the second or third week in April but not before. This difference with respect to our neighbours results in turn in an increased use of artificial light in the morning which cancels out the hypothetical savings of the evening. We all know that by advancing the clock one hour those who had to get up at 6:30 or 7 in the morning with DST they are indeed doing it one hour earlier when most of Canada is still quite dark. Moreover, since usually that is also the period of the day when temperatures are the lowest, that brings an increase in other forms of energy namely gasoline, since people will need extra time to start their cars, indirectly throwing more carbon emissions into our atmosphere.

To make things worse, when in 2006 the Americans decided to lengthen DST which used to start the first Sunday in April and end the last Sunday of October, to begin now the second Sunday of March and end the first Sunday of November, the Canadian authorities slavishly followed suit without considering the climatic and geographic differences. At the time the reason given was that we needed to be synchronized with the Americans because many Canadian companies do business with the U.S. and therefore we have to be able to contact them on their own time (!). That reason certainly doesn't hold any water: for a bunch of people who die to sell something to their Americans counterparts we are all subjected to losing one hour of sleep and battle the cold weather? Indeed we are neither saving electricity nor any other form of energy and we are not gaining any large amount of extra light after people finish working because our northern evenings don't have all that extra light that our American neighbours enjoy. It seems that when it comes to time, the wisest people are those in Saskatchewan who never got into this DST scheme.",mtltimes.ca,news,Mtltimes.ca,,0.2078431372549019,452624734,5,https://mtltimes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Daylight-Saving-Time.jpg,

""Sharing Memories"" is Meta's annual Holocaust Remembrance Day project in Israel, and its main goal is to connect the younger generation to the testimonies of Holocaust survivors and raise awareness of their financial situation.

Every year, about 20 celebrities and content creators, with hundreds of thousands of followers, participate in the project, meeting with survivors and recording their testimonies. The videos of these meetings are then shared as reels on Instagram, helping creators connect their young audiences to the stories of the survivors.

In the project, which the Latet organization also takes part in, several celebrities have participated, including dancer Anna Aronov, singer/songwriter Odeya Azulay, actress/singer Ania Bukstein, dancer/actress Dana Frieder, actress/singer Meshi Kleinstein, American actor and comedian Michael Rapaport, pastry chef Or Shpitz and actor/comedian Orel Tsabari.

'These two holocausts are totally different since I know everyone in Be'eri'

Haim Ra'anan, 89

It took them 20 hours, beginning at 6:30 a.m. on that terrible Shabbat, to be evacuated from the kibbutz. Haim Ra'anan, an 89-year-old Holocaust survivor, hid in the shelter in his house in Kibbutz Be'eri with his caregiver, son and grandson.

They could not leave the shelter or utter a sound, as the rumors that reached them via WhatsApp were horrifying: Terrorists had raided the kibbutz, invaded homes, murdered and kidnapped their friends.

It also took a long time for the evacuation to take place. ""The soldiers put me in a wheelchair and started taking me out,"" he says. ""Walking 300 or 400 meters to the kibbutz gate took us an hour and a half.

""As we evacuated, we heard the shooting and saw the explosions and burning apartments, but you didn't even think about it because you were still in survival mode. We crossed the street where my grandchildren live.

""When I passed the homes of my grandchildren, I asked the soldiers if they had already evacuated these homes and what had happened to them. Actually, it was only when I got onto the bus that I realized they were fine. I can't express how fortunate I am. Next door to my granddaughter's apartment, a father and his baby were murdered by gunfire,"" Ra'anan says.

""My home wasn't invaded by terrorists, but terrorists attempted and even succeeded in invading the houses of all my grandchildren. Fortunately, they are all safe. The house of one of my granddaughters was set on fire, but they escaped through a window to another neighbor's apartment. It was a miracle.""

Wallenberg -- then and now

Ra'anan was born in Hungary in 1935, and when WWII began, his father was in Israel making preparations for his family's aliyah. ""For the entire period of my childhood, the one I actually never had, I grew up without my father,"" he says.

Since he was a child during those dark war days, he does not remember much of them. ""The only picture I have from that time is of my mother and me in the Jewish ghetto, with a yellow badge on our clothes.""\

He only remembers how they were saved with the help of certificates issued for them by Raoul Wallenberg, the Righteous Among the Nations. ""They helped us get out of the ghetto and move to another area of Budapest. Thanks to them, we survived.""

Ra'anan is currently living in a sheltered housing complex located on Raoul Wallenberg Street in Tel Aviv.

Today, he has 19 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. During the Holocaust, he was the same age as one of his grandchildren with whom he locked himself in the shelter on Oct. 7. In spite the many parallels, Ra'anan sees a clear distinction between the experiences:

""These two holocausts are entirely different stories for me. The six million feel differently than my kibbutz's 200 residents who were murdered, kidnapped or injured. I knew everyone in Be'eri.""

""My real holocaust was when my grandson was kidnapped""

Tzili Wenkert, 83

""When Hamas kidnapped Omer, my grandson, all of my pain suddenly burst open. He is such a gorgeous boy, so cute and so kind. I feel as if someone has smashed me with a big hammer. This is the real holocaust,"" says Tzili Wenkert, 83, a Shoah survivor.

""My adorable, kindhearted grandson is a hard worker and a student - what has he done?"", she continues in deep sorrow. ""He is not in good health, he suffers from colitis, a condition that requires medication. There is no way of knowing whether the medication that was sent reached him. No one knows anything.""

When Wenkert was six weeks old, in August 1941, she was taken to a small room in the ghetto with her parents, where they lived for three and a half years with her grandfather, grandmother and two aunts.

""We lived in very poor conditions. Due to the cold winter and the lack of electricity, the family had to sell its belongings to buy food and wood. I remember the Nazis bombarding the ghetto and many people dying from the attacks, hunger, diseases and the freezing temperatures.""

Even with poverty, hunger and constant worry, her family tried to hold Shabbat dinners and even sometimes bought an emaciated chicken for everyone. Wenkert's mother knew how to sew. She made her children's clothes from her grandfather's shirt, and boots out of his hat.

As a child, Wenkert became ill with dysentery, but there were no medicines and no physicians in the ghetto. ""My grandmother did things that grandmothers do, and she saved me. I was unable to walk, but I survived and recovered.""

Torn to pieces

After the war, Wenkert and her family returned to her father's hometown. In addition to the hardships and poverty of that time, she remembers getting a little sister while being three and a half years old. ""We rented a small apartment with no electricity and applied to make aliyah to Israel.""

However, the communist regime in Romania prevented her family from moving to Israel, and it was only after she got married that she made aliyah in 1965, together with her husband, who was a Holocaust survivor as well. ""I wanted to come home to the State of Israel. It was not an easy transition for me; my husband passed away at a young age and I was left alone with the children.""

She has been filled with worry and fear since Oct. 7. ""I was a baby during the Holocaust in Europe, and I had a family. But now, who will protect me? Everyone is in distress. There is pain in my heart for Omer, but there is also pain in my heart for my sons -- Omer's father and Omer's uncle, who barely speaks. He has no children of his own, so his brother's children are in fact his children as well.

""I wish us better days. Almost every morning, I hope that maybe there was a miracle last night and I missed it. In my heart, I am torn to pieces. I have always thought it could have been worse. Long ago, I decided there was nothing to cry about, and I still don't cry to this day. I just feel like my nose is a little wet.""

Wenkert wishes to convey a message to her grandson: ""Please come home, Omer, stay safe, and do whatever you want. When you visit Grandma, take her abroad. It is now your turn to take her. Did you hear that, my baby?""

'Back then, we were scattered all over the world, but now we are in a country with our own army'

Pnina Ben Yosef, 84

""I remember every detail of that terrible day,"" says Holocaust survivor Pnina Ben Yosef, 84, a resident of Kfar Maimon in the ""Gaza Envelope."" As she woke up to the explosions of missiles, she thought they were heavier than usual.

""With a broken leg, I sat with a cup of coffee in front of the window and wondered why people don't attend the synagogue. It was Simchat Torah. At that moment, my daughter and grandson, who was already wearing a military uniform, broke into my home, informed me that a war had broken out, and took me to the [bomb] shelter.""

She stayed at the shelter for many hours, unaware of what was happening outside. A group of terrorists approached the moshav fence and managed to shoot down a helicopter, but soldiers killed them.

Ben Yosef considers this a miracle: ""If this had not happened, there would most likely have been a massacre here as well. In the afternoon, we received a WhatsApp message calling all gun owners to the armory. I wondered if I should ride my scooter out with my personal gun, but I was afraid.""

She remained at the shelter until Tuesday afternoon when the chairman of the local emergency team came to tell her she had to leave. She refused. After he bluntly explained that she would be a burden if she stayed, Ben Yosef left Kfar Maimon, for the first time in her life feeling that her time had passed and that she could no longer contribute.

For the Israeli public, Kfar Maimon will be remembered as the place where tens of thousands of protesters opposing the disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005 did not march as planned to Gush Katif after the Yesha Council prevented the police from breaching the perimeter.

""Had the demonstration continued and they had been successful in stopping the deportation, Oct. 7 would not have taken place. The difficult circumstances began after the deportation. We received strong fences, electric gates and shelters, but maybe now we will get tunnels and bunkers as well,"" she concludes.

Amid the events of the past year, Ben Yosef realized how much these days differed from her childhood in Europe.

""I was born after the German invasion of Poland, a year after my uncle was murdered. As a locomotive driver, my father carried supplies to the front and brought back wounded people. One day, he stopped in our town, told the family what he saw and what was happening to Jews, and told them to leave everything and run away. As they have lived there for hundreds of years and have experienced many pogroms, they believed that it would also pass eventually.

""He managed to rescue only my mother and me; the rest stayed behind and perished. We escaped to Russia. After the war, we were deported back to Poland, and it turned out that nobody was left in the family. We ended up in a refugee camp in Austria, in which we stayed until 1948, and in April we arrived in Israel.""

According to Ben Yosef, the Holocaust of European Jews is a completely distinct event from the Oct. 7 massacre.

""We were scattered all over the world during the Holocaust, we were powerless to do anything to stop the slaughter, but now we are here in our country with our own army. We were shocked and terrified, and our losses were huge, but we managed to pull ourselves together and raise our heads.""",jns.org,news,Jewish News Syndicate,,0.2627450980392156,452601697,3,https://cdn.jns.org/uploads/2024/05/Beeri-home.jpg,
