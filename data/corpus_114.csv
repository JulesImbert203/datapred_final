Swiss landmark decision on the admissibility of intra-EU investment arbitration

By Michael Feit Dr. iur., LL.M., Attorney at Law Partner Direct phone: +41 58 658 55 08 [email protected]

and Francesca Borio MLaw, Attorney at Law Senior Associate Direct phone: +41 58 658 57 61 [email protected]

The legal and political backdrop or the ""crusade"" of the EU against investment arbitration

In March 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decided in Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V. that the arbitration clause contained in the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between the Netherlands and Slovakia was incompatible with EU law. This judgment steered EU law into collision course with investment arbitration.

In May 2020, 23 EU member states signed the Agreement for the termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties between the Member States of the European Union (Termination Agreement), by which all intra-EU BITs between the signatories were terminated. In the Termination Agreement, the signatories confirmed that intra-EU BIT arbitration clauses were ""contrary to the EU Treaties and thus inapplicable"".

The CJEU rendered further judgments confirming the incompatibility of intra-EU investment arbitration clauses with EU law, namely Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy LLC in September 2021 (regarding the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)), Republic of Poland v. PL Holdings Srl in October 2021 (regarding ad hoc arbitration), and the DA v. Romatsa et al. decision in September 2022 (regarding the unenforceability of the Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula et al. v. Romania ICSID award).

In April 2024, the European Parliament voted for a withdrawal of the EU from the ECT.

Most recently, Spain (the appellant before the Swiss Supreme Court (Court)) announced in May 2024 in the State Official Gazette its withdrawal from the ECT. This decision was taken after investors had initiated numerous arbitrations against Spain in relation to its renewable energy reforms.

The Swiss landmark decision

By decision 4A_244/2023 dated 3 April 2024, the Court upheld jurisdiction of a Swiss seated ad hoc arbitral tribunal over a claim brought by a French investor against Spain under the ECT.

In the arbitration proceeding, Spain objected that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear a claim between an investor from an EU member state and an EU member state. The tribunal dismissed the objection, and Spain filed a set-aside application before the Court.

In its introductory remarks, the Court commented that for several years now, EU bodies had been waging a ""crusade against international arbitration"" regarding intra-EU disputes. The Court did not mince words in its decision.

The Court noted that state courts outside of the EU have no obligation to adhere to EU law. Therefore, decisions rendered by the CJEU, and thus also the Komstroy judgement, are not binding on a Swiss court deciding on a set-aside application against an award rendered by a Swiss seated tribunal.

The Court further stated that it generally accepts the opinion expressed by the supreme court of the state that enacted

the foreign law in question. However, the Court is more reluctant to do so when the question arises whether the rules adopted by a community of states, such as the EU, take precedence over rights deriving from a multilateral treaty, such as the ECT. In case of a conflict between these rules, the community of states may be tempted, as in Komstroy, to assert the primacy of its own law over that of the multilateral treaty.

Following a detailed analysis, the Court concluded that the unconditional consent given by Spain in the arbitration clause contained in Article 26 ECT did not exclude intra-EU disputes.

The Court also rejected the notion that there was a conflict between Article 26 ECT and EU law. The Court was not convinced by the reasoning given in Komstroy, noting that it was essentially, if not exclusively, based on the requirement to preserve the autonomy of EU law, without taking any account of international law or the rules of interpretation of treaties.

The Court continued that even if Article 26 ECT were incompatible with EU law, nothing under public international law would suggest that EU law should take precedence over the ECT.

In conclusion, the Court dismissed the set-aside application.

Recent trends and the impact of the decision

Without being exhaustive, the following trends can be observed inside and outside of the EU:

Arbitral tribunals routinely confirm their jurisdiction in intra-EU disputes. By way of example, in the ICSID arbitration Adria Group B.V. and Adria Group Holding B.V. v. Croatia, the tribunal rejected in October 2023 Croatia's objection that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the investors' claims

arising out of the Croatia-Netherlands BIT. The notable exception to the rule constitutes Green Power Partners K/S and SCE Solar Don Benito APS v. Spain, in which the tribunal declined its jurisdiction under the ECT because it was an intra-EU dispute.

State courts within the EU are expected to deny the existence of a valid arbitration agreement in intra-EU disputes. In Germany, for example, a party can prior to the constitution of the tribunal request a state court to declare the arbitration proceedings inadmissible. On that basis, and upon application by Croatia, the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt declared a German-seated UNCITRAL arbitration brought by Austrian investors under the Austria-Croatia BIT inadmissible.

Pursuant to the German Supreme Court, a party can even file such an application against ICSID arbitrations brought under the ECT. In line therewith, German courts declared the ICSID arbitrations Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd and others v. Germany, Uniper SE, Uniper Benelux Holding B.V. and Uniper Benelux N.V. v. Netherlands and RWE AG and RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV v. Netherlands inadmissible.

Similarly, state courts within the EU have set aside awards on intra-EU grounds (such as in the matters Triodos SICAV II v. Spain, Norvenergia II - Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v. Spain and PL Holdings in Sweden) and have refused to enforce intra-EU ICSID awards (such as in the matter Micula in Luxemburg and Sweden).

However, when enforcement actions are brought outside of the EU, EU state courts tend not to interfere. By way of illustration, the Landgericht Essen dismissed in April 2024 Spain's request for an anti-enforcement injunction to

prevent the enforcement of the intra-EU ICSID award in RWE Innogy GmbH and RWE Innogy Aersa S.A.U. v. Spain in the United States, holding that no obligation exists under the CJEU case law to resist enforcement of ICSID awards outside of the EU.

State courts outside of the EU generally allow enforcement of intra-EU awards, even though there are some uncertainties.

In recognition and enforcement proceedings of an ICSID award under the ECT in the United Kingdom, the High Court ruled in Infrastructure Services and Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Spain that the EU Treaties and the Achmea and Komstroy judgments do not trump pre-existing treaty obligations under the ICSID Convention. Therefore, EU law does not constitute a legal basis to refuse the enforcement of ICSID awards.

In the United States, two district judges rendered opposing decisions with regard to Spain's request to dismiss the investors' petitions to enforce awards based on the case law of the CJEU. One district court judge rejected Spain's intra-EU objection with regard to the two ICSID awards 9REN Holding S..R.L. v. Spain and NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. v. Spain. In contrast thereto, the other district court judge dismissed the petition to enforce the award rendered by an ad hoc Geneva seated UNCITRAL tribunal in Blasket Renewable Investments LLC v. Spain. The three enforcement proceedings are currently pending before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

In this context, what is the potential impact of the Court's decision? A number of commentators criticized the CJEU for limiting its analysis to EU law. The Court, however, conducted a broader international law assessment and its decision has been widely lauded as wellreasoned. State courts outside of the EU

2

faced with set-aside and enforcement requests might, therefore, take guidance by the decision of the Court. The decision could, thus, further tip the scale in favor of upholding jurisdiction and enforcement.

Conclusion

Within the EU, intra-EU disputes face, as some commentators noted, a hostile environment. Outside of the EU, however, the recent decision of the Court confirms the trend that intra-EU investment arbitrations are viewed as valid and enforceable. EU investors are, therefore, well advised to place the seat of the arbitration and to seek enforcement in a non-EU state. To increase protection, however, investors should consider taking proactive steps by structuring their investments within the EU through a non-EU state. Switzerland with its leading investment protection network is an excellent choice.

European equities ended Monday broadly positive, while the U.S. market was closed for the Memorial Day holiday.

Traders maintained an overall positive risk sentiment on European assets, driven by near-total certainty that the European Central Bank (ECB) will deliver a rate cut at its June meeting.

Three key ECB members -- chief economist Philip Lane, Finland Central Bank governor Olli Rehn and France Central Bank governor François Villeroy de Galhau -- made reassuring statements indicating a rate cut is imminent.

""A June rate cut is appropriate if the inflation outlook holds,"" Lane said. ""Inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, making it the right time in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates,"" Rehn said. ""Barring a surprise, a June rate cut is a done deal,"" Villeroy said.

Traders now almost fully price in a June rate cut and expect a total of 65 basis points in cuts (more than two cuts but less than three) by the end of the year.

Power purchase agreement is also called as ""Green Power Purchase Agreements"" (Green PPAs). The power purchase agreements operate over the medium or long term (5 to 20 years). In the agreement, the developer sells the power generated to the host customer at a fixed rate which is typically lower than the local utility's retail rate. Several benefits are associated with PPA such as a fixed long-term rate and guarantees of origin of renewable assets. All regions are engaged in the development of the power sabing solutions which can help to lower the global footprints and cost saving on power consumptions. The adoption of green energy is increasing in Asia, and Australia which is creating power purchase agreement market opportunity.

Lower power prices encourage customers to sign PPAs and make fewer purchases of electricity from utilities which is boosting the power purchase agreement market share in the energy industry. PPA ensure developer to receives the income from the sales of electricity as well as any tax credits and other incentives generated from the system which is uplifting the power purchase agreement market size in forecasted period. At the end of the PPA contract term, a customer may be able to extend the PPA or choose to buy the solar energy system from the developer.

Large corporates are entering into PPA to buy electricity from renewable energy projects located near to their premises (on-site projects) and sometime remote from their location (off-site). As per power purchase agreement market forecast, corporates are entering to PPA to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency which help the business to complete the sustainability policies. In all regions, the consumption of green energy is increasing on high rate which foster the power purchase agreement market growth. With implementation of the proposed programs to build a energy efficient corporate building will help to boost the power purchase agreement market trend in near future.

Within this framework, the Chief Human Rights Officer (CHRO) is responsible for monitoring human rights risk management as a whole. The respective Human Rights Officers (HROs) are responsible for compliance with human rights due diligence in the subsidiaries. The Human Rights Expert Team is based in the Group Sustainability department at RWE AG. This team is responsible for the further development, management and implementation of the human rights strategy. If necessary,

it supports the specialist departments involved in the operational processes and the subsid- iaries.

Describe how the strategy is integrated into operational processes and procedures.

The complaints procedure includes three channels for reporting human rights or environmental risks or violations to RWE. External persons and interest groups can contact us directly via e-mail (humanrights@rwe.com) or contact an external law firm. If requested, anonymity can be maintained. RWE employees also have the option of submitting complaints via the internal ""Business Keeper Monitoring System"" tool. The human rights experts from the Human Rights Expert Team then process all complaints received.

The Human Rights Expert Team carries out annual and ad hoc risk analyses for the entire Group, including the subsidiaries. With the support of an external provider, a differentiated risk analysis is carried out for the company's own business division and for all direct suppliers in the supply chain.

As a further preventive measure, RWE has introduced a qualification process for potential suppliers in which they are subjected to a review; suppliers undergo a screening focused on ESG, environmental protection, human rights and labour rights and a responsible supply chain. Whether suppliers have to undergo this screening depends on a fixed turnover threshold of 50,000 euros or more.

In a first step, the respective procurement departments carry out the so-called basic checks. This involves a media screening of the relevant suppliers.

Based on the results of the basic checks, an extended check can be triggered. For this pur- pose, the potential suppliers receive predefined questionnaires for self-disclosure, which the employees of the procurement departments evaluate.

Finally, an advanced check can be carried out, which can be triggered by the results of the basic and extended checks, risk analyses or complaints received. An advanced check can also be triggered independently of the results of the extended checks if the supplier has a risk that is identified by the abstract risk analysis (country or sector).

The Advanced Check is the responsibility of RWE AG's Human Rights Expert Team. It is a detailed questionnaire that is specifically tailored to the situation and the supplier to be checked, which is designed to identify environmental and human rights risks. Any gaps identified are recorded in agreement with the supplier in a Human Rights Action Plan, which is intended to close these gaps. To this end, special measures and tasks are defined, the implementation of which is intended to minimise the risks. If the measures adopted do not lead to a satisfactory solution that meets both the legal and RWE's own internal require- ments, further formal reviews or a formal audit process may follow. RWE also reserves the right to reject suppliers or cancel existing contractual relationships..

To ensure that the human rights and environmental due diligence obligations are effective and complied with, RWE has introduced processes to monitor the due diligence obligations.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1294117647058823,453636302,14,,

Full transcript - RWE AG PK (RWEOY) Q1 2024:

Thomas Denny: And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller: Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year. We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years. In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates. Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million. As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group. And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth. This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates. We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year. And with that, let me hand back to Thomas for Q&A.

Thomas Denny: Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley.

Robert Pulleyn: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends? And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign. But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point. I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

Alberto Gandolfi: Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January. And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale. But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further. Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller: I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices. I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices. I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need. And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right. Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers. I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi: Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller: I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

Operator: The next question comes from Peter Bisztyga of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).

Peter Bisztyga: So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices? So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller: Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted. So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA. To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe? I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S. Yes. So no big difference.

Olly Jeffery: The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful. And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller: Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year. When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact. Obviously, we are very happy with the Q1 results.

Operator: And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend? Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller: Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that. I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power. And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

Deepa Venkateswaran: I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts. So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt. Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller: Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers. And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say. But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

Operator: We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas (OTC: BNPQY ).

Harry Wyburd: It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion? First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller: Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again. So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here. The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas. I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

Operator: Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] Thank you there are no further questions in queue. I will now hand it back to Thomas for closing remarks.

Thomas Denny: Excellent. Thank you all. Thanks for the good discussion and for dialing in today. If you have further questions on any of the topics, feel free to reach out to the IR team. And apart from that, I wish you a great afternoon, and speak soon. Thank you.

Full transcript - RWE AG PK (RWEOY) Q1 2024:

Thomas Denny: And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller: Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year. We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years. In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates. Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million. As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group. And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth. This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates. We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year. And with that, let me hand back to Thomas for Q&A.

Thomas Denny: Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).

Robert Pulleyn: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends? And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign. But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point. I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

Robert Pulleyn: Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator: The next question comes from Alberto Gandolfi of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).

Alberto Gandolfi: Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January. And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale. But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further. Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller: I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices. I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices. I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need. And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right. Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers. I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi: Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller: I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

Operator: The next question comes from Peter Bisztyga of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).

Peter Bisztyga: So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices? So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller: Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted. So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA. To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe? I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S. Yes. So no big difference.

Olly Jeffery: The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful. And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller: Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year. When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact. Obviously, we are very happy with the Q1 results.

Operator: And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend? Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller: Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that. I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power. And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

Deepa Venkateswaran: I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts. So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt. Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller: Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers. And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say. But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

Operator: We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas (OTC: BNPQY ).

Harry Wyburd: It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion? First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller: Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again. So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here. The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas. I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

Operator: Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] Thank you there are no further questions in queue. I will now hand it back to Thomas for closing remarks.

Thomas Denny: Excellent. Thank you all. Thanks for the good discussion and for dialing in today. If you have further questions on any of the topics, feel free to reach out to the IR team. And apart from that, I wish you a great afternoon, and speak soon. Thank you.

CFO Michael Muller highlighted the company's adjusted EBITDA of €1.7 billion, primarily driven by favorable wind conditions and strong trading performance.

Despite an increase in net debt to €11.2 billion, due to significant investments in growth initiatives, RWE confirmed its full-year guidance at the lower end of the range. The company's issuance of U.S. green bonds marked a successful reentry into the U.S. debt market, indicating investor confidence in RWE's sustainable business model.

RWE's strategic decisions in the first quarter, such as the sell-down of DogaBank South and the acquisition of the Norfork project portfolio, demonstrate the company's focus on optimizing its offshore portfolio. The successful issuance of green bonds underscores RWE's commitment to sustainability and has been met with strong investor interest. While the company faces the challenge of increased net debt due to its growth investments, it remains confident in its financial strategy and the ability to generate attractive returns. The demand for Power Purchase Agreements, particularly for green energy, remains strong, offering RWE further opportunities in the renewable energy market. Despite some volatility and regional differences in profitability, RWE's outlook for the year remains stable, supported by its strategic investments and operational performance.

In light of RWE AG's recent financial performance and strategic initiatives, certain metrics and InvestingPro Tips can provide additional insights into the company's current standing and future prospects.

InvestingPro Data shows that RWE AG's market capitalization stands at a robust $28.82 billion USD, reflecting the company's significant presence in the energy sector. Despite a notable decline in revenue growth over the last twelve months, with a decrease of 21.61%, RWE's gross profit margin remains strong at 40.43%. This suggests that while the company is facing top-line pressure, it maintains a solid ability to control costs and generate profit from its revenues.

An InvestingPro Tip highlights that RWE AG is seen as a prominent player in the Independent Power & Renewable Electricity Producers industry. This is particularly relevant given the company's focus on sustainability and growth within the renewable energy market, as mentioned in the article.

Thomas Denny: And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller: Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year. We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years. In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates. Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million. As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group. And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth. This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates. We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year. And with that, let me hand back to Thomas for Q&A.

Thomas Denny: Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).

Robert Pulleyn: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends? And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign. But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point. I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

Robert Pulleyn: Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator: The next question comes from Alberto Gandolfi of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Alberto Gandolfi: Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January. And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale. But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further. Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller: I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices. I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices. I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need. And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right. Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers. I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi: Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller: I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

Operator: The next question comes from Peter Bisztyga of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

Peter Bisztyga: So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices? So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller: Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted. So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA. To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe? I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S. Yes. So no big difference.

Olly Jeffery: The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful. And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller: Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year. When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact. Obviously, we are very happy with the Q1 results.

Operator: And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend? Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller: Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that. I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power. And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

Deepa Venkateswaran: I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts. So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt. Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller: Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers. And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say. But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

Operator: We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).

Harry Wyburd: It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion? First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller: Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again. So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here. The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas. I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

Operator: Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] Thank you there are no further questions in queue. I will now hand it back to Thomas for closing remarks.

Thomas Denny: Excellent. Thank you all. Thanks for the good discussion and for dialing in today. If you have further questions on any of the topics, feel free to reach out to the IR team. And apart from that, I wish you a great afternoon, and speak soon. Thank you.

CFO Michael Muller highlighted the company's adjusted EBITDA of €1.7 billion, primarily driven by favorable wind conditions and strong trading performance.

Despite an increase in net debt to €11.2 billion, due to significant investments in growth initiatives, RWE confirmed its full-year guidance at the lower end of the range. The company's issuance of U.S. green bonds marked a successful reentry into the U.S. debt market, indicating investor confidence in RWE's sustainable business model.

RWE's strategic decisions in the first quarter, such as the sell-down of DogaBank South and the acquisition of the Norfork project portfolio, demonstrate the company's focus on optimizing its offshore portfolio. The successful issuance of green bonds underscores RWE's commitment to sustainability and has been met with strong investor interest. While the company faces the challenge of increased net debt due to its growth investments, it remains confident in its financial strategy and the ability to generate attractive returns. The demand for Power Purchase Agreements, particularly for green energy, remains strong, offering RWE further opportunities in the renewable energy market. Despite some volatility and regional differences in profitability, RWE's outlook for the year remains stable, supported by its strategic investments and operational performance.

In light of RWE AG's recent financial performance and strategic initiatives, certain metrics and InvestingPro Tips can provide additional insights into the company's current standing and future prospects.

InvestingPro Data shows that RWE AG's market capitalization stands at a robust $28.82 billion USD, reflecting the company's significant presence in the energy sector. Despite a notable decline in revenue growth over the last twelve months, with a decrease of 21.61%, RWE's gross profit margin remains strong at 40.43%. This suggests that while the company is facing top-line pressure, it maintains a solid ability to control costs and generate profit from its revenues.

An InvestingPro Tip highlights that RWE AG is seen as a prominent player in the Independent Power & Renewable Electricity Producers industry. This is particularly relevant given the company's focus on sustainability and growth within the renewable energy market, as mentioned in the article. Additionally, analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, indicating a positive outlook on RWE's financial performance.

Moreover, RWE AG's P/E Ratio (Adjusted) for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 stands at 9.79, which could suggest that the stock is reasonably valued compared to earnings. This metric, coupled with the company's strong return over the last week and month, with price total returns of 9.07% and 16.7% respectively, signals that investor sentiment may be trending positively.

Thomas Denny: And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q1 2024 RWE Investor Analyst Conference Call today. Our CFO, Michael Muller, will guide you through our key highlights and financial performance for the first quarter and the outlook for the current year. And with that, let me hand over to you, Michael.

Michael Muller: Yes. Thanks, Thomas, and good afternoon to all of you. First quarter was a solid start into 2024. Adjusted EBITDA stood at €1.7 billion, driven by good wind conditions in our offshore business, capacity additions in the onshore business and a good trading performance. Earnings in flexible generation were lower after exceptional market conditions in the previous year. We confirm our full year guidance at the lower end of our guidance range. We've also made significant progress on offshore portfolio optimization. We have derisked our 3 gigawatts DogaBank South project by selling down 49% to our partner Mazda, and we have acquired the highly attractive 4.2 gigawatts Norfork project portfolio from Battenfeld. These well-developed U.K. offshore projects are eligible for CFD auctions in the coming years. In April, we issued the first U.S. green bonds. With this transaction, we have successfully reentered the U.S. debt market. In the future, we want to be a regular issuer in the U.S. bond market. The USD 2 billion bond has maturities of 10 and 30 years. We saw a high demand from investors with the bonds being oversubscribed 3.8x. The final book order book volume was close to USD 7.6 billion. The high level of interest demonstrates our ability to access debt capital markets, enabling us to finance our growth investments at attractive rates. Let's now take a closer look at the Q1 2024 financials. After the exceptional earnings in the first quarter of last year, EBITDA in Q1 2024 stood at €1.7 billion, thanks to a good performance. In offshore wind, adjusted EBITDA was €548 million, and earnings were up mainly on the back of better wind conditions. Onshore Wind and Solar recorded an EBITDA of €341 million. This was driven by organic growth and the full contribution of the CEB assets. Adjusted EBITDA of the flexible generation business was €552 million. As expected, we have seen a lower earnings development in line with normalized market conditions after the exceptional year in 2023. Our Supply & Trading business had a good start into 2024, and Q1 results stood at €251 million. On the back of the strong operational performance, adjusted net income amounted to €801 million. The year-on-year adjusted financial result is almost stable. For adjusted tax, we applied the general tax rate of 20% for the RWE Group. And finally, adjusted minority interest reflects lower earnings contributions from minority partners. The adjusted operating cash flow was minus €379 million at the end of Q1 and is mostly driven by seasonal effects in operating working capital. Changes in operating working capital were marked by the seasonal purchase of CO2 certificates compensated by positive effects from the reduction of trade receivables and withdrawals for gas in storage. Net debt increased to €11.2 billion due to investments and by timing effects. In total, we invested €2.3 billion net into our grain growth. This includes the acquisition of the Norfolk offshore projects from Battenfeld and our sell-down of 49% of the Docavan-South projects to Mazda. Other changes in net financial debt amounted to €1.9 billion. This includes timing effects from hedging and trading activities. Our net position from variation margins for power generation hedging stood at minus €1.4 billion, representing an outflow of €2.8 billion. This includes net variation margins from the sale of electricity as well as purchases of the respective fuels and CO2 certificates. We expect other changes in net financial debt to revert over the course of the year. For 2024, we confirm our outlook despite the faster normalization in European commodity markets. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion. Adjusted EBIT is assumed to be between €3.2 billion and €3.8 billion and net income will range from €1.9 billion to €2.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and net income at the lower end of the guidance ranges. The dividend target is €1.1 per share for this year. And with that, let me hand back to Thomas for Q&A.

Thomas Denny: Thank you, Michael. We'll now start the Q&A session. Operator, please begin.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] we'll pause for just a moment while waiting for the queue for questions. Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Robert Pulleyn of Morgan Stanley.

Robert Pulleyn: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, revisiting a theme that's been going on a year. May we ask what benefit, if any, you're seeing from rising power demand from the data center theme, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And of course, in your European markets, what this might mean for long-term power demand trends? And secondly, if I may, given a U.S. politicians comment about offshore wind over the weekend in the U.S., may we ask how you assess the risks for that industry under the next U.S. administration from 2025. And in particular, do you see permitting risks if RWE is indeed successful in the New York and New Jersey auctions this year. And assigned to that, do those auctions have flexibility on the commissioning date would be very interesting.

Michael Muller: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. Let's start with the data center topic, which is a hot topic currently in all the discussions. I mean, I can confirm you that we obviously are also strongly engaging with tech companies around PPAs. And actually, we are about to communicate another PPA we signed with a big tech company just recently over 400 megawatts at an attractive price. And that brings us overall to almost half of the volume of our U.S. capacities under construction being contracted to tech companies. So indeed, we do see strong interest for those companies in greening up their portfolio. And maybe that brings me also to the next aspect around offshore. I mean, obviously, we have also read the announcements. We don't have any more insights into the exact campaign. But if we look at the U.S., we see a continuing strong trend for green electrons. It's on the PPA side, we just discussed, but the same is true. I mean if you think about New York, I mean, if New York wants to decarbonize, they essentially need offshore wind. So therefore, we see the trend for offshore as yes, unbroken, so it stays intact. I mean, you already hinted to the right point. I mean, if you think about our New York portfolio, we have a lease there. And now we have the options to go into CFD auctions and to develop the project. I mean we still see demand for those projects. But at the same time, we also do have flexibility in developing the project and also looking for different offtakes. So it is something we'll observe, but it's nothing where you see me today being nervous.

Robert Pulleyn: Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator: The next question comes from Alberto Gandolfi of Goldman Sachs.

Alberto Gandolfi: Thank you, thank you for taking my questions Michael and Thomas. My first question is on guidance. If I look at your Slide 8, you're really stressing everywhere, lower end, lower and lower end. But if I take your net income for Q1 and I simply add the E.ON dividend you're due to receive, you'll be at €1 billion, so you'll be at more than 50% of the full year. So can I just ask you, I mean, in hindsight, where you to rush perhaps in downgrading guidance on the 25th of January. And again, with the benefit of hindsight, why sticking to the low end and not essentially mark to market the fact that commodities, pulp prices are going to spread have expanded a little bit, and the outlook appears even better on the horizon as we discussed, more PPAs, better returns. We are hearing from many players, power demand inflecting. So I'm just curious to see why you stick to such a cautious message. If there's anything that I'm not seeing here? And the second, I know you don't comment, but if we may not talk specifically about Amprion, but it's been reported that it's potentially for sale. But let's say, if it's not Amprion, is there anything that perhaps you may consider noncore that is perhaps for sale? And I'm quite intrigued by this route because it as far as I understand, it was besides the typical asset rotation, none of this was included in your CMD. So if you were to divest an asset that gives you proceed of a couple of periods, what would that be used for? I see that you're talking about net debt normalizing by year-end. So is RWE going to reduce leverage further. Is there a special dividend you're thinking or something else? Any cash return to shareholders? Or are you going to use this to create your own dignit foundation because perhaps the government has been dragging their feet?

Michael Muller: I mean let's start with the guidance. I mean, my comment here would be, we are just a quarter into the year. And therefore, we stick to the guidance we have put forward and also our communication towards the lower end. Yes, I think what you rightly raised is kind of the commodity markets have stabilized in the meantime. So while we went with the message in January, we saw a continuing trend of lower carbon and gas prices and therefore, power prices. I mean, that went down to kind of the minimum in Feb and since then has recovered. I mean, especially on the CO2 side, it came back to, I would say, normalized levels yet days is probably more potential going forward. But yes, I mean, market prices have stabilized, and that is obviously also helping income. I mean you saw that in our full year guidance or full year communication, we showed how much of our existing fleet in renewables is still exposed to market prices. And there is still something also in 2024, and that is benefiting from higher prices. I guess the more important topic you raised is the long-term outlook where, I mean, we always said that despite we see a quicker normalization in the first years, we continue to stick to our guidance and also our view in the later years because on the one hand side, in our plans, we already baked in a normalization of prices. And at the same time, there is also some potential improvement to come. So therefore, I would say it's too early to judge about full year, and I can just reiterate that our long-term outlook for 2027 and 2030 perfectly stays intact. Talking about Amprion, I mean, let me first say, Amprion is a financial investment, which we are very happy with. I mean they are strongly performing yet unburned tonnes with a high investment need. And therefore, it's very clear that when we discuss capital allocation, we also discuss the capital that is needed with Amprion. And therefore, that's what we communicated. We are obviously and I think that's kind of usual hygiene, you should have when looking at capital allocation are looking into options around financing and in general, loss options around Amprion. So that's the comment here. I mean the other one on divestments. Yes, you're fully right. Divestments, on the one hand side was leads to cash in and therefore, delever again. And at the same time, you should also expect book gains on those which we haven't baked into our plan. That's also very important to notice. I mean, I would consider divestments as being part of our capital allocation, yes? So therefore, I can just reiterate what we said at the full year numbers. I mean, when we look at capital allocation, we do see currently attractive returns. Clearly, projects are meeting the returns we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. Please bear also in mind this is kind of our return expectations. Obviously, every project should strive to outperform our return expectations, and that is also something we are seeing in projects where we actually see FID. So therefore, I can just confirm we do see valuable projects in our pipeline, and that is something we will consider when we look at capital allocation, including when we free up capital divestments.

Alberto Gandolfi: Michael, sorry, but if I can just clarify this point, which I think is extremely important. Thank you, all very clear by the way. Let's say you were to receive, I don't know, I'm too there a number, €1 billion in Amprion. Is your inclination to return this capital to shareholders or to put it at use somewhere else?

Michael Muller: I mean, so I wouldn't talk specifically about Ampion. I mean what we said is that when we look at capital allocation, we look at where do we see investment opportunities. We currently see attractive investment opportunities in our projects. Yet we also said that if the conditions change, returning capital, more capital to our shareholders would be in the option space and something to look at.

Peter Bisztyga: So first one, just coming back to this data center point. In ERCOT, we've seen forward curves already moved up by more than 20%. You've got, I think, 10 terawatt hours of exposure in that market. And I guess what I'm wondering is whether the clear impact of data center demand on those forward curves gives you an incentive to keep more of that business merchants going forwards? Or are you, in fact, seeing appetite for PPAs at premiums to even these higher forward prices? So that's kind of my first question. And then staying on that topic, are you seeing any difference in the premiums that data centers or hyperscalers are willing to pay for PPAs in the U.S. versus Europe, please? And are you having those kinds of conversations in Europe.

Michael Muller: Yes. Peter, happy to take the questions. I mean, first of all, ERCOT, I mean, indeed, how prices has gone up. I mean we also said that already in the course of last year, we gave the clear steer to our businesses, at least on new projects that they should go for contracted businesses. And that's I mean, we said 95% of the projects that have CODs last year were contracted and also the new assets have a high share of contracted. So that stays intact. So I wouldn't say we go for more merchants. At the same time, on the existing fleet, yes, we do see upside, and that's been part of the regular hedging activities with power prices going up. And obviously, we try to capture those business, those upsides on the existing fleets. Contracting existing assets in ERCOT, via PPA. To be honest, it's not so common. So you get the better prices with new assets, and that is really also then the focus. And on the existing one, it's really then optimizing in the current environment. Is there a big difference between the U.S. and Europe? I wouldn't say so. So we're also seeing demand from data center providers to purchase power in Europe? No, actually not. And also, I mean, you could imagine that maybe in Europe, they would even be more bullish on buying green molecules. That's actually the same also in the U.S. Yes. So no big difference.

Olly Jeffery: The first is on debt. Obviously, it's quite a high number in Q1. We've spoken about that reversing or elements of that reversing over the rest of the year. Could you give us kind of a band where you see that net debt figure possibly landing by the year-end? That would be helpful. And the second question is just current the trading business. We had a very strong Q1, far ahead of good guidance in that business. How do you feel about the outlook for that trading business for the rest of the year? Is there a change in the development of what we've just seen in Q1? Thank you.

Michael Muller: Yes. Olly, I mean, on net debt, I guess, that is the question. The market is really interested in. I mean, look, the big movements we have seen is working capital. So we do expect that to fully revert even more over the course of the year. When we think about other elements in the financial debt, so especially on around variation margins. We also expect that to revert over the course of the year. So I mean, if you do the math and you assume that kind of we continue with the run rate of the current investments we have, that should bring you by year-end about the same order of magnitude where we currently are with net debt so therefore, kind of balance impact the temporary effect or seasonal effect and then counterbalance by continuing investments through the course of the year. Around trading, I mean, you know that we don't, our perspective is always Q1 is pretty early. So it's not the point in time where we would kind of judge on the full year, and therefore, we keep the existing guidance intact. Obviously, we are very happy with the Q1 results.

Operator: And the next question comes from Deepa of Bernstein. Please go ahead. She dropped the line. While waiting for her to requeue, we shall go to Wierzbicka of UBS.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Hi it's Wierzbicka Serwinowska UBS. Two questions from me. The one is on the renewables. In Plant recently, the higher returns in the renewables project versus what they expected at the CMD in 2023? And do you see a similar trend? Do you also see returns going up versus what you saw last year? And maybe if you, would you be able to disclose some items on the latest renewable projects that you are developing to give us more confidence that basically investing renewables give shareholders a better value. And the second one is on the European data centers, would you be able to disclose how much PPA in terms of the two hours have you signed so far in Europe?

Michael Muller: Yes, Deepa, First, on the returns, I mean, I would kind of stick to the numbers we have put forward at the Capital Market Day. I think the important point here, and that is something we also had in quite some discussions on the road is kind of the range we put forward is the range for what we call the hurdle rates, so that needs to be met in projects. Yes, what you typically would see there are projects that are also exceeding those returns. And actually, the way how we see the project is not to just meet the hurdle rate, but to exceed it. And therefore, that also gives me confidence that we do have really value-accretive projects that meet the return expectations and even go beyond that. I mean on data center demands to be fair, kind of the high ratio of tech companies purchasing power from us in the U.S., we don't see that yet in Europe. At the same time, we do have ongoing requests from data centers in Europe on PPAs. And we are also seeing data centers now being built up. I mean, you may have seen that there was in the press that we sold land in the RinesLiknite area to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which wants to build a data center, and they also want to build a second one, I think, in the Frankfurt area. And clearly, those data centers go along with the demand for green power. And that's actually what we're also seeing. There are requests for PPA offers, and that is something I would also expect to pick up in Germany in Europe. And if I can add one shouldn't forget that also in Europe, many of the assets that we built in onshore and solar space actors because that's a very risky, very high price alternative as well.

Wierzbicka Serwinowska: Okay. So there is no number of terawatt hours that you can give us in the for data centers in Europe in your portfolio?

Deepa Venkateswaran: I think there was a technical problem. So I don't know if anyone's already asked the question I'm about to ask. So I had 2 questions. One is you mentioned about the PPA in the U.S. for 400 megawatts. So more broadly, I wanted to see now that you've finished this quarter, what are you seeing in terms of PPA pricing, particularly versus where baseload power prices are trending both in the U.S. and Europe? And are you seeing a green premium from your buyers? So that was the first question. The second one, just a clarification on net debt. Just recapping my understanding is, on the one hand, you're guiding to a normalization on variation margin, probably more than a normalization of working capital with inflows but also you're highlighting that the CapEx run rate is similar to first Q, so around 10 billion-ish, which is probably lesser than most of us have in our model. So could you just clarify that? And does this mean also that if you're spending €10 billion this year out of the €55 billion program, then in later years, there's some farm down or something, which kind of compensates. Could you comment on that?

Michael Muller: Yes. Deepa, I mean, let's start with the net debt and then the fund- assumptions, I couldn't have phrased it better. So everything is correct what you said. And then on PPAs, I mean, look, the difficulty is, first of all, we don't communicate prices. We have contracted with customers. And the second one, PPA prices also very much depend on where they are. So I mean, if you go to some of the East Coast states, especially the more Noel, the higher the prices get so they get pretty much sometimes even to levels you see in Europe even above that. If you go to some other areas where it's easier to build renewables, but also the costs are lower price levels are lower. And then it's a question if you go for yes, unit contingents, busbar PPAs, or what's kind of the setup is. So it's difficult to say. But I mean, what is fair to say there is demand for green molecules and that is helping, yes, to achieve attractive returns in our renewable projects. And that's in the end. I mean, in the end, I don't care so much about the absolute price of the PPA. I care about the economics of the specific projects. And that is the important view, and that is indeed something where we see, as I said, meeting our return expectations and even exceeding them.

Operator: We'll now take our next question from Harry Wyburd of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).

Harry Wyburd: It's just 1 and a half question. Firstly, just on the debt. Could I just clarify, so you're saying that you expect year-end net debt to be where it is now at about €11 billion. Is that assuming neutral variation margin? Or is it assuming the variation margin going where it is at GBP 1.4 billion? First one and the second one, on Flexion, I just wondered, given that commodity prices have rebounded, have you seen market conditions in flexible generation also rebound in the last few weeks in line with power prices? Or have you seen a divergence in profitability there from a sort of linear relationship with power prices? And are you seeing any regional differences in Flexion if you look at some of some metrics, it suggests that the U.K. market perhaps is looking a bit weaker in terms of intraday volatility than the continence. I'd be interested to know if that's something that you've seen as well.

Michael Muller: Yes, I mean, let's first talk about the variation margins. I mean, roughly, we assume like other changes in net debt, about €2 billion to revert over the course of the year. So that's roughly the ballpark number. On flexible generation, my comment would be the following. What we see is that the intraday and they have volatility, that is clearly picking up again. So while I would say maybe the fab around that. We saw a slight deterioration here still, and then we always said that this intraday that optimization is fairly stable. I mean it was maybe down to 90% of the level we would expect. And that has clearly recovered. So we see further strengthening here. The other topic is more of what we described as kind of the time value. So what we have seen is that the overall curve has come down and especially optimizing between hours that has deteriorated. We haven't seen a significant pickup here. But what is at least important is it has stabilized. So therefore, kind of the guidance that we have out there can be clearly confirmed but clearly, with now I mean, people are also a little bit more concerned around gas. I mean, going into the winter and let's see what happens, there is clearly upside because, I mean, you know our fleet is, in the end, long volatility. So in case volatility picks up again, we would clearly benefit with our fleet there.

Operator: Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question [Operator's instructions] Thank you there are no further questions in queue. I will now hand it back to Thomas for closing remarks.

Thomas Denny: Excellent. Thank you all. Thanks for the good discussion and for dialing in today. If you have further questions on any of the topics, feel free to reach out to the IR team. And apart from that, I wish you a great afternoon, and speak soon. Thank you. Bye-bye.",investing.com,news,Investing.com,,0.6784313725490196,453512491,41,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB6J0AJ_L.jpg,
8129057354,eng,False,2024-05-15,15:02:10,2024-05-15T15:02:10Z,2024-05-15T15:01:27Z,news,0.5568627715110779,https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/102319/,Discover more,"MOSCOW. May 13 (Interfax) - The European gas market has replaced most of the Russian gas it used to receive with U.S. liquefied natural gas, but Europe has also been saved by extraordinarily mild winters, lower gas consumption by industry and increased use of renewable energy. However, European gas analysts believe the crisis is now over, and, faced by reduced supply flexibility and a recovery in consumption, infrastructure constraints and competition from Asia for LNG, as well as uncertainty over the continued transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, every cubic meter of gas could count in the event of a cold winter.

Cara MacDonald, head of LNG & Clean-Fuel Supply and Origination at RWE AG, said at the Flame gas conference at the end of April that Europe had been able to withstand the past two heating seasons thanks to mild weather and a demand side response. ""Europe had much milder weather, especially in the winter of 2022-2023, which cooled consumption and allowed storage to fill up. Additionally, due to high gas prices, we have seen demand destruction in Europe, while in Asia, this meant more fuel switching,"" she said.

""But is the crisis over? Things could change in the coming winters, especially if there is no flexibility in LNG supplies. The only answer may be continued demand side response,"" MacDonald said, although she believes this might not save the situation.

""Yes, we coped by reducing demand, but can we do it again? When I look at demand side signals, I see that the market will become tighter,"" she said, adding that there was limited supply flexibility and any incident at an LNG plant could tighten the balance.

Glenn Vinvand Kviljo, head of trading at Equinor, also said the European market faced uncertainty in the coming winter after two mild winters: ""Will there be another mild winter, or we will get back to the normal, cold winter? We cannot sit back and relax,"" he said.

Chief analyst at Uniper Energy, Gregor Pett, warned that despite the fact that the market has been more bearish in recent weeks and months, this was mainly associated with a weak economy, air temperatures, high storage and others. ""But for most market participants, this is a fragile balance, and at any time the situation can turn around [...] and there could be a repeat of the crisis. It's not over, it's far from over,"" he said.

""It is difficult to foresee what will happen in terms of supply and demand. It depends on many things, including the weather. We can have a very mild winter, so gas demand in Europe will be low. If it's an extremely cold winter the demand will be higher than in the past two years and a lower supply could be a problem,"" a representative of a European gas trader told Interfax in an interview.

""If there was an outage of the production from Norway or hurricanes in the U.S. - there are many events which can happen and which can bring to a very tight situation in Europe where each Bcm of supply is important,"" the trader said, adding that a very hot summer could also cause demand to spike.

He said that current gas prices in Europe include a risk premium since all these factors were difficult to predict. ""And each player has an own opinion if prices are fair or not. Currently the market is pricing in, I would say, a normal cold winter, but the winter can be different,"" the trader said.

Europe has reduced gas consumption by about 20% over the past two years to approximately 330 billion cubic meters due to high gas prices (27 EU countries), as well as the energy transition drive, while some industrial demand for gas has been lost forever, some participants believe. However, there are signs of demand recovering.

Cheniere Energy said in a presentation that gas consumption in Europe was now below the 2017-2021 average. It fell 19% in the region's six biggest economies, with consumption in industry down 22% (between 18% and 23%), in energy - 14% (between 8% and 25%), in other sectors - 21% (between 17% and 28%).

Uniper Energy's Pett said Europe has lost a very large amount of industrial production due to high prices, but ""we expect a lot of industrial demand to return to the market."" However, most gas analysts were unable to say to what extent demand might return.

Gautam Mukherjee, head of gas analytics at BP, said it was necessary to look at sectors. For example, in industry, gas is being replaced by heat pumps; in the energy sector, on the one hand, there is more renewable energy, but on the other hand, coal is being replaced. Overall, he said, Europe has had very weak economic results over the past two years, so not only has demand for gas fallen, but demand for electricity has also been very low. And Europe's economy is expected to recover in the coming years, so demand for gas in both the power industry and other industry will increase.

Uniper Energy's Pett said the difference in consumption in a mild and normal winter for northwestern Europe was 30 billion cubic meters, and last winter was ""extraordinarily mild.""

Given the demand and uncertainty over the weather, gas market participants are concerned about whether the contract for Russian gas transit through Ukraine will be extended, and if not, whether LNG can replace it. Europe has lost over 100 billion cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies from Russia over the past two years, but supplies through Ukraine and TurkStream continue to some extent.

Andrei Prokofiev, head of Division for Cooperation with Clients at Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine (GTSOU), said that both the transit deal and the agreement between Gazprom and GTSOU would expire at the end of the year. ""As the Ukrainian authorities and European Commission have said many times, Ukraine is not going to negotiate with Russia on this matter - no direct agreements. What does this mean from a practical point of view? Not having an agreement between operators means we'll not be putting any capacity up for at auction,"" he said.

""This is like the situation on our border with Romania, where we have interconnectors - Tekovo, Mediesu Aurit. ""There is infrastructure, a tariff, but we cannot come to an agreement with the Romanian TSO due to technical problems. And neither we nor Romania are offering capacity,"" Prokofiev said.

Last year, Europe bought about 135 bcm of LNG, almost half of it from the United States. However, industry participants say that there will be a limited supply of LNG on the market in 2024-2026. Marco Saalfrank, head of trading for continental Europe at Axpo, estimates that the market will be tight in Europe in 2026-2027 because Europe will need to pay high prices to attract LNG. In addition, there will be high volatility in the market because Europe has lost its flexibility (for supply), he said.

There is an opinion that higher gas prices for Europe will become a new reality. Andrew Walker of Cheniere Marketing said that Europe, as the largest market for US LNG exports, has not traditionally been tied to spot prices in Asia, where the market is tight, as it relies on pipeline supplies. However, now Europe is more tied to Asian prices. ""So now this is a bit of a new reality for Europe, so Europe will probably have to get used to higher prices,"" he said.

Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at TotalEnergies, said that before the conflict in Ukraine, Europe was a balancing market where any cargo could find a home. However, then the paradigm changed, and Europe became a premium market like Asia. ""I think in the coming months and years we will see competition for LNG between the two basins, European and Asian,"" he said.

Dugas also said that the European market has become characterized by volatility and uncertainty. ""Every time there is a supply problem, it creates volatility in the market [...] and to solve these two problems, we need flexibility,"" he said.

The TotalEnergies trader said not to forget about the recovery in China, which imported 20 million tonnes of LNG in the first quarter, which is 4 million tonnes more than the previous year. ""So recovery in demand in China and possibly Europe will be the two main themes in the market over the next few years,"" he said.

""There really is a maximum amount of LNG on the market now. And if there is no increase in supply with growing demand in Asia, Europe will not be able to fill the balance with liquefied natural gas,"" a spokesperson from RWE said.

However, LNG sellers need assurances that their products will be in demand in the long term. Landon Larson, marketing director for American LNG producer Sempra Infrastructure, said that European companies are now buying LNG, but Europe has announced decarbonization goals, and this puts pressure on investment decisions for the second wave of LNG projects, raising questions about whether or not the projects will be able to sell their LNG, and about their financial sustainability. At the same time, many believe that Europe has set unrealistic goals for its energy transition, at least where timing is concerned.

Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has already suspended the issuance of new licenses for LNG exports, intending to assess the extent to which Europe is focused on LNG purchases, or if it will still move away from using fossil fuels.

Axpo's Saalfrank said that there are risks in signing long-term contracts. Therefore, Europe is going to reduce gas consumption; in addition, one cannot exclude ""the risk that Russian gas will return to the European market in 10-20 years,"" he said.

Another risk relates to price: gas purchases tied to oil or linked to Henry Hub spot pricing is sold at a TTF price in Europe, so such price risks are not easily hedged in long-term contracts. In addition, the trader said, there is a regulatory risk (on carbon regulation). ""So, 3-4 years ago, Ireland and France refused to buy American LNG because it is produced in shale deposits,"" he said.

Nicola Duffin, head of LNG supply at Ineos Energy Trading, said that Ineos had the advantage of being a private company and is not under pressure from shareholders to divest from fossil fuels. ""We are realistic and understand that we will need gas for the next 20 years. Other companies may agree with this, but they are not allowed to,"" she noted. In order to enter into a long-term agreement for the purchase of LNG, you need to be ""relatively large and have a huge amount of money,"" Duffin said. It is difficult for small companies to operate in the LNG market.

Gulfstream LNG CEO Vivek Chandra said that traders help grow the LNG business by becoming intermediaries, for example, with countries like Sri Lanka that cannot enter into long-term contracts. Asia, especially China and India, are much more active in purchasing LNG, as they consider it a transition fuel, he said. In addition, we should not forget about the Middle East; for example, Kuwait has become an active buyer, as well as African countries.

But infrastructure is no less of a risk. Laurent Hamou of Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) said the gas infrastructure utilization in Europe has been at record levels over the past two years and this means that ""in the coming years we cannot afford any disruptions. Any problem will be very noticeable, and we have a limited number of suppliers and less flexibility.""

""Everyone says that everything is fine - there's spare capacity at LNG terminals in Europe. But I believe that, on the contrary, we need to increase capacity and give the market more flexibility. Let's see what happens in the next two years. Our contract for gas through Ukraine might come to an end, there might be some recovery in demand, and I'm sure we'll need more LNG terminals,"" he said.

Hamou said there was a regional discrepancy in Europe in this regard - for example, Spanish terminals were operating at normal levels, while infrastructure in south-eastern Europe, for example, the terminal in Greece, as well as infrastructure in Germany, were operating at a totally unusual level.

Halting gas transit through Ukraine will result in even bigger restrictions, but we need to think about all European consumers. ""If French consumers paid the German price for gas like in 2022, they would be paying 5 billion euros more. This is a lot of money. You need geographical flexibility, time flexibility and supply flexibility. Any accident will affect prices,"" Hamou said.

Hungary is heavily reliant on Ukrainian transit. ""Yes, some new infrastructure is being built, but it is not yet clear how it will work. There is a lot of infrastructure in the north and south, but gas needs to be delivered to the center,"" he said.

Thomas Thorkildsen, chief commercial officer at Hoegh LNG, in his presentation cited the degree of exposure of some European countries to Russian gas. Croatia gets 81% of its gas from Russia (1.4 bcm), Austria - 75% (5.6 bcm), Hungary - 62% (6.2 bcm), Slovakia - 57% (2.4 bcm), Serbia - 61% (2.1 bcm) Greece - 39% (2 bcm) and the Czech Republic - 35% (2.6 bcm).

Half of this gas enters the EU through Ukraine, the transit agreement ends at the end of 2024, and this must be borne in mind, he said.

A trader at Hungary's MVM CEEnergy told Interfax that the company was now buying 10-11 LNG cargoes, equivalent to 1 bcm of gas, at the Krk terminal in Croatia. The capacity booking contract is valid until 2027, and the company plans to bid at auctions for new capacity. But any increase in purchases will depend how LNG competes with pipeline supplies. Hungary is also counting on potentially higher production within the EU, in particular the Neptun project offshore Romania, which ExxonMobil could put on line in 2026-2027.

But the MVM CEEnergy trader said that although there is enough regasification capacity, pipeline tariffs across Europe might be too high to justify buying LNG.

GTSOU's Prokofiev echoed this. He said European markets were highly segmented and it was difficult to transport LNG from Greece to Slovakia, Austria or Germany. The issue of capacity can be resolved, for example, there is capacity in Ukraine. ""But due to the tariff policies of some countries, this sometimes does not make economic sense. For example, the cost of storage in Germany, likewise in Austria, the anticipated increase in tariffs in Slovakia, make the problem more difficult. And this needs to be resolved, at least at the government level,"" he said, adding that since everyone protected their own market, perhaps a decision at the level of the European Commission is needed.

Prokofiev also said that last year about 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas were pumped into Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities by non-residents and another 0.6-0.7 bcm remained there. At the same time, the capacity of Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities is more than 10 bcm, which could cover a potential interruption of gas supplies to Europe.

Market participants believe that even more LNG terminals need to be built. Ineos Energy Trading's Duffin said Europe needed a huge amount of imported capacity by 2028. She said Northwestern Europe, under normal weather conditions, would have to import an additional 46 bcm of gas as LNG - demand is growing due to the switch from coal to gas, and internal production is falling.

But demand might also fall, so it might make more sense to use floating storage regasification units. But Duffin said it should be remembered that FSRUs are more expensive, do not last forever and they do not have operational flexibility. ""So if governments put an end to subsidies and companies stop paying, they will go to other countries where they are needed more quickly. And I see that in Europe people soon forgot about this and are perhaps not taking it as seriously as they should,"" she said.

Hoegh LNG's Thorkildsen said the company currently owned 10 FSRUs, and a further three LNG tankers that can be converted into FSRUs, which usually takes up to 18 months, but there have been precedents where this happened within five months. He said a new FSRU costs about $500 million and that all shipyards were now booked until 2028.

Hoegh LNG estimates that in 2022 the order for new LNG vessels broke all records and amounted to 145 units, with 68 in 2023 and 44 tankers in 2024. At the same time, 10 gas carriers have already been built in 2024, another 60 are expected, with plans to build 86 tankers in 2025, 84 in 2026, 73 in 2027 and 26 in 2028.The LNG fleet is currently about 600 tankers, excluding FSRUs, which are mainly used as terminals.

The company's FSRUs operate under long-term contracts - half of them in Europe (three in Germany and one in each of France and Lithuania). But Thorkildsen said China was the only market that plans to increase regasification capacity to 200 bcm from the current 100 bcm. Other growing markets, such as Italy, Malaysia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, where LNG demand is forecast to grow, are not making decisions to build regasification facilities.

He said Germany was the exception among European countries. But given the announced growth in imports and planned commissioning of regasification capacities, their utilization will reach 63% in 2025-2028 and 82% by 2029, which corresponds to the situation with capacity utilization in north-west Europe in 2022, when there was chaos and high prices. Utilization of LNG terminals in Germany will exceed 90% after 2030, reaching 95% in 2033.

In Italy it is even worse - utilization of its regasification capacity will reach 94% in 2024, and this will no longer be enough from 2027, given the planned import of LNG. ""This doesn't look like energy security,"" Thorkildsen said.

According to Hoegh LNG, 40% of gas consumed in Europe in 2024 will be LNG - about 175 bcm of approximately 420 bcm consumed, while 119 bcm will be supplied by gas pipelines from Norway, 22 bcm by the gas pipeline from Russia, and 67 bcm will be produced in the EU and the UK.

A drop in Russian gas supplies is expected after 2024 as the transit contract with Ukraine expire; supplies from North Africa and Azerbaijan will remain largely at the same level; imports from Norway will decrease from 108 bcm in 2029 to 81 bcm in 2034 and 58 bcm in 2039; and Europe's own production will decrease to 60 bcm.

LNG supplies are expected to increase initially to 203 bcm in 2029, accounting for half of consumption, but as consumption falls to approximately 330 bcm in 2039, LNG purchases will also fall, to 157 bcm, Hoegh LNG says in its presentation.

The European Union is currently discussing a ban on imports of Russian LNG. Last year, Europe purchased about 18 bcm of LNG from Russia, with about 1 bcm of this redirected to Asian markets.

However, market participants believe European politicians will most likely postpone the embargo until 2027, when new LNG projects go on line for world markets.",interfax.com,news,interfax.com,,-0.1058823529411764,453481330,1,,eng-9563546

RWE has had a solid start to the year: in the first quarter of 2024, the company posted adjusted EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of €1.7 billion and adjusted net income of €0.8 billion. The reduction in earnings compared to the same quarter of the previous year are mainly due to lower earnings in the Flexible Generation segment, as expected.

Michael Müller, Chief Financial Officer of RWE AG: ""We can look back on a solid first quarter of 2024, with significant increases in earnings in both Offshore Wind and Onshore Wind/Solar. This shows that our investments are paying off. In the first three months of the year, 42% of our electricity generation came from renewable sources - and we are continuing to invest massively. Currently, we have projects with a total capacity of 8.3 gigawatts under construction. We confirm our outlook for 2024 and our target of paying a dividend of €1.10 per share for the current fiscal year.""

With net investments of €2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024, RWE continues to expand its portfolio. Around €1 billion was attributable to the acquisition of three offshore wind development projects from Vattenfall off the coast of the UK. In addition, RWE invested more than twice as much in the construction of new wind and solar power plants in the first quarter as in the same period last year. Proceeds from the sale of a 49% stake in the Dogger Bank South offshore wind projects in the UK to Masdar had a counteracting effect.

RWE is currently building plants with a total capacity of 8.3 gigawatts (GW). These include the offshore wind projects Sofia off the UK coast with 1.4 GW and Thor in Denmark with 1.1 GW. RWE is also driving forward the expansion of onshore wind and solar energy and the construction of new batteries with more than 100 projects under construction in Europe and the US.

Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in the Offshore Wind segment amounted to €548 million, compared to €473 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in earnings is mainly due to improved wind conditions. In the same period of the previous year, these were below the assumed average.

Onshore Wind/Solar: The Onshore Wind/Solar segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of €341 million compared to €247 million in the first quarter of 2023. The positive earnings development is mainly due to the commissioning of new capacity and the recognition of the business activities of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses in the US for the full three months. Moreover, wind conditions at the European onshore sites improved marginally overall, which also had a positive effect.

Flexible Generation: Adjusted EBITDA of the Flexible Generation segment decreased to €552 million in the first quarter of 2024 from €1,181 million in the prior-year period. The margins on electricity forward electricity sales and income from the short-term optimisation of power plant dispatch fell short of the exceptionally high level recorded last year.

Supply & Trading: Although the segment's adjusted EBITDA of €251 million was below the previous year's figure of €289 million, it once again reached a high level. A strong proprietary trading performance was the basis for this.

As of fiscal 2024, RWE has pooled the lignite-fired power generation business and the nuclear decommissioning activities under the name 'Phaseout Technologies' and has been managing them based on adjusted cash flows. This business is no longer included in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income.

Continued solid financial position despite high level of investment activity. As of 31 March 2024, RWE reported net debt of €11.2 billion. Due to the company's significant growth investments, the leverage factor, i.e. the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA, is likely to increase in 2024. However, it is expected to remain well below the upper limit of 3.0 that RWE has set for itself.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1450980392156862,453477654,1,,

The decline in earnings was mainly attributed to the result at the Flexible Generation segment which, as expected, fell from ""exceptionally high"" levels a year ago.

RWE reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of EUR 1.7 billion (USD 1.8bn), which marks a year-over-year decline of 26%, and adjusted net income of EUR 801 million.

Earnings rose in the company's Offshore Wind segment, mainly due to improved wind conditions, and in its Onshore Wind/Solar segment, driven by capacity additions.

Chief financial officer Michael Mueller said the increased earnings in the offshore and onshore renewables segments show that the company's investments are paying off. ""In the first three months of the year, 42% of our electricity generation came from renewable sources - and we are continuing to invest massively. Currently, we have projects with a total capacity of 8.3 GW under construction,"" he added. RWE aims to expand its green portfolio to more than 65 GW by 2030.

During the first quarter, RWE generated 33,780 GWh of electricity, 42% of which from renewables, compared to a coal share of 28%. The company's power production declined by 9% from a year ago, due to less coal generation and the decommissioning last year of its last German nuclear power station.

Generation from renewables was up 19%, with a significant increase from solar as a result of the 2023 acquisition of US energy firm Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses. The wind business showed an 8% rise, driven by better weather conditions and capacity expansion.

RWE said its 2024 outlook has not changed since March, when it signaled it expects to achieve the lower end of its guidance provided in November 2023 due to a significant drop in electricity prices in the meantime.

Terrestrial Energy, a developer of Generation IV advanced nuclear power plants that use its proprietary Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) technology for industrial heat and power supply, and Schneider Electric, a Fortune Global 500 supplier of digital control systems for energy management, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly develop commercial opportunities and advance the deployment of IMSR plants.

The joint press statement did not indicate a timeline for construction of multiple units of the advanced reactor which uses molten salt to produce a 700C outlet temperature for applications of electricity generation and process heat industrial applications.

The announcement, in terms of timing, comes on the heels of an announcement by OKLO of having signed a letter of intent with a major developer of data centers to provide up to 500 MW of electrical power to data centers. Oklo noted its 15 MW basic design is capable of being scaled to 50 MW. The deal includes a $25 million upfront payment to Oklo for future implementation of the power purchase agreement.

In terms of the Terrestrial Energy deal, the scope is more wide ranging with multiple levels of engagement with Schneider Electric. Gary Lawrence, President of Power & Grid Systems at Schneider Electric, said, ""Schneider Electric's value proposition is to leverage Digital Twin technology across the full IMSR project lifecycle and during operations - resulting in a reduction of project time to market and cost as well as more efficient operations.""

Terrestrial Energy's IMSR plant heat and power supply has many industrial uses that require reliable, baseload zero-carbon energy supply at near-site locations, such as dedicated power for large data centers and cogeneration for heavy industrial facilities. Schneider Electric systems automate and optimize energy management for improved performance, efficiency, and contribute to the commercial and sustainability goals of its customers.

The firm emphasizes the collaboration offers solutions to the major energy challenges faced by data center operators and many heavy industries operating a wide range of industrial processes such as hydrogen, ammonia, aluminum, and steel production.

In April 2023, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), following a systematic and multi-year review against nuclear regulatory requirements, concluded that there were no fundamental barriers to licensing the IMSR plant for commercial use. This was the first-ever regulatory review of a commercial nuclear plant using molten salt reactor technology and the first advanced, high-temperature fission technology to complete a review of this type.

Ontario Power Generation (OPG) expects nuclear construction work on its first small modular reactor (SMR) to begin in 2025, according to filings submitted to Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC).

The Ontario, Canada, utility is planning to build a total of four SMRs at the Darlington nuclear site and would use GE Hitachi's BWRX-300 reactor technology. The four units once deployed would produce a total 1,200 MW of electricity.

OPG has said it expects construction on the first reactor to be complete by 2028, with the additional SMRs coming online between 2034 and 2036. The utility aims to take learnings from the construction of the first unit to deliver cost savings on the subsequent units.

In April 2024, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) announced that the existing environmental assessment (EA) for the Darlington New Nuclear Project (DNNP) is applicable to the BWRX-300 reactor.

""The CNSC's decision confirms OPG's stance related to the EA and is a critical next step in OPG's application for a [license] to construct the first of the four SMRs at the DNNP site,"" said Ken Hartwick, OPG President and CEO.

""Our fleet approach to both early work and the project as a whole means we can leverage common infrastructure, such as shared roads, utilities, and water intake, which will help to drive down regulatory, construction, and operating costs,"" added Hartwick.

Aaol Atomics, an Austin, TX, based micro reactor startup seeking to commercialize the INL Marvel SMR R&D reactor, announced is has signed a Siting Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) from the Department of Energy (DOE). This marks the first step towards deploying the first Aalo-1 reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site in Idaho.

The Aalo-1 reactor, a 10 MWe sodium-cooled, UZrH-fueled reactor, represents a significant leap forward in sodium-cooled advanced nuclear technology in the US. Leveraging low-enriched uranium (LEU) at just under 10% U235 enrichment.

Aalo intends to leverage this Siting MOU towards locating the first Aalo-1 reactor at the Central Facilities Area (CFA) site within INL, a location chosen to collocate with newly constructed megawatt-scale electrolyzers, and INL's upcoming hydrogen motorcoach fleet. Aalo-1 can provide electricity and heat behind the meter to these electrolyzers and demonstrate seamless hydrogen production. Aalo has recently signed an Umbrella Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) to leverage INL's expertise to support the exploration of this deployment.

The next step for Aalo is to enter into a real property agreement with DOE, selecting a specific parcel of land to site the Aalo-1 reactor. This step will involve extensive collaboration with INL and local stakeholders to ensure the chosen site meets all technical and environmental requirements.

The firm also announced plans to construct a full-scale, non-nuclear prototype of the Aalo-1 reactor. This endeavor follows the recent successful completion of the Aalo-1 conceptual design. The prototype will serve as an important step in testing and refining our technology, ensuring that Aalo-1 meets its technical, regulatory, and economic targets.

The team is now engaged in the preliminary design. This phase is critical for verifying the reactor design. In parallel, the firm kicked off preparation of regulatory submittals.

Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE:IDR) announced it has entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Radiant Industries, Inc. to participate in the Kaleidos Frontier Pilot Program designed to aid Radiant in the development and planned deployment of their meltdown-proof portable microreactor, Kaleidos.

The agreement establishes a pathway for Idaho Strategic and Radiant to operate one or more of the first five Frontier Kaleidos units at a viable Idaho Strategic mining site. The mining company is involved in extraction of gold, rare earths, and thorium at multiple sites along the Idaho /Montana border.

As part of the agreement, the two companies agree to jointly study the licensing process and timeline, and other business and operations factors relevant to the deployment of a Kaleidos unit.

Radiant's Kaleidos unit is designed to replace diesel generators with base-load power in remote and hard-to-reach locations. Cooled by Helium, which cannot become radioactive, Kaleidos can output 1 MWe electric and 1.9 MWt of heat, and operate with TRISO fuel for an average of five years before refueling . The firm notes it is ""mass-producible, transportable by air, sea, road or rail and roughly the size of a shipping container.""

As part of the competitive US Department of Energy (DOE) FEEED program, Radiant is building towards a test at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in 2026, with their first commercial reactors available as soon as 2028.

Radiant will get the support of the National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC) at INL to test a fueled prototype of the Kaleidos microreactor.

Licensing Radiant Industries engaged the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on the Kaleidos SMR through a public meeting on 02/17/23. Radiant Industries has also engaged the NRC on their business and licensing plans. The firm submitted its Regulatory Engagement Plan to the agency in November 2023. The firm has set a target date of delivery of its first unit to a customer by 2028.

Financing Radiant has secured public and private sector financing in support of the Kaleidos microreactor. This includes more than $50 million in private financing and two awards through the US Small Business Innovation Research program totaling approximately $250,000 to support modelling and simulation capabilities.

Through the NRIC FEEED process, Radiant was awarded up to $1.5 million to progress towards deployment of the Kaleidos at the DOME facility located at the INL's Materials Fuels Complex (old Argonne West) site about 25 miles west of Idaho Falls, ID.

Fuel In 2022, Radiant Industries launched a Request for Proposals for fuel fabricators to produce TRISO fuel, and in 2023 the company entered an agreement with Centrus Energy to work towards identifying a path to provide a future supply of HALEU for up to 20 Kaleidos microreactors.

(WNN) The UK government is awarding GBP196 million (USD245 million) to Urenco to build a uranium enrichment facility with the capacity to produce up to 10 tonnes of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) per year by 2031. The funding decision is part of the UK government's efforts to cut out dependance on Russia for nuclear fuel for its reactors.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that building the uranium enrichment plant was essential for guaranteeing the country's nuclear and energy security. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says the new facility ""will put an end to Russia's reign as the only commercial producer"" of HALEU fuel in Europe.

The GBP195 million funding is part of the GBP300 million HALEU program announced in January 2024, with the energy department saying that the remaining funding would be allocated later this year to other parts of the program including to support deconversion capability (converting the enriched uranium into a form to be made into fuel).

Urenco is one third owned by the UK government, one third by the Dutch government and one third by two German utilities, E.ON S.E. and RWE AG.

Other HALEU Production Efforts

In September, Orano revealed plans to extend enrichment capacity at its Georges Besse II (GB-II) uranium enrichment plant in France, and said it had begun the regulatory process to produce HALEU there.

The US is also developing a domestic supply of HALEU. In November 2023, Centrus Energy delivered the first HALEU produced at its American Centrifuge Plant in Piketon, Ohio, to the US Department of Energy (DOE).

Construction of the 16-centrifuge demonstration cascade plant began in 2019, under contract with the DOE. The delivery by Centrus of more than 20 kilograms of HALEU to the DOE means that phase one of the contract has now been completed and Centrus can move ahead with the second phase: a full year of HALEU production at the 900 kilograms per year plant.",energycentral.com,news,Energy Central,,0.4274509803921569,453218212,1,,

The agreements, signed at a ceremony in Hamburg, will provide HVDC systems for offshore wind projects from RWE's global pipeline, which are expected to be grid-connected at the start of the next decade.

Hitachi Energy will supply its voltage source converter (VSC) systems, while Aibel will be responsible for the construction of the offshore platforms.

The agreements give RWE the opportunity to procure more HVDC systems for future offshore wind projects.

""Through our partnership with Hitachi Energy and Aibel, we are able to secure early the necessary engineering and production capacity for three major HVDC systems to ensure future offshore wind farms can be integrated into the grid,"" said Sven Utermoehlen, CEO RWE Offshore Wind.

""Given the challenging market situation, this type of agreement is exactly what we need to succeed,"" he added.",renewablesnow.com,news,Renewablesnow.com,Plamena Tisheva,0.4666666666666666,452862769,1,https://cdn.aiidatapro.net/media/65/09/d0/t780x490/6509d0076f153b879f8e8b4da1d31ed7.jpg,eng-9546167

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says the new facility will be built at Urenco's Capenhurst site in northwest England, will support around 400 jobs and ""will put an end to Russia's reign as the only commercial producer"" of HALEU fuel in Europe.

HALEU - uranium enriched to between 5% and 20% uranium-235 - will be used in the advanced nuclear fuel required for most of the next-generation reactor designs currently under development. At present, only Russia and China have the infrastructure to produce HALEU at scale. The first advanced reactors are scheduled to be operational in the early 2030s.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that building the uranium enrichment plant was essential for guaranteeing the country's nuclear and energy security.

Urenco CEO Boris Schucht said: ""The responsibility the nuclear industry has to help governments and customers to achieve climate change and energy security goals is clear. We welcome this government investment, which will help accelerate the development of a civil HALEU commercial market and in turn the development of the next generation of nuclear power plants. These plants will have even higher safety standards and lend themselves to quicker licensing and construction processes.""

The GBP195 million funding is part of the GBP300 million HALEU programme announced in January, with the energy department saying that the remaining funding would be allocated later this year to other parts of the programme including to support deconversion capability (converting the enriched uranium into a form to be made into fuel).

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: ""This investment will enable the UK to fuel advanced reactors around the world, building on our existing capabilities to strengthen energy security for our allies.""

Zara Hodgson, Director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute, which is also based in the northwest of England, said: ""This is the biggest single investment in UK nuclear fuel production capability in decades, and it is especially welcome as it will accelerate the supply of the next generation of fuels that are vital for this new net zero nuclear era. Urenco Capenhurst's HALEU Enrichment capability will help hugely to unlock the deliverability of advanced nuclear projects, opening the door to sustainable electricity and heat for industries from nuclear, across the UK and overseas. We look now towards to how we can support this important project through training and innovation.""

The USA is also developing a domestic supply of HALEU. In November last year, Centrus Energy delivered the first HALEU produced at its American Centrifuge Plant in Piketon, Ohio, to the US Department of Energy (DOE). Construction of the 16-centrifuge demonstration cascade plant began in 2019, under contract with the DOE. The delivery by Centrus of more than 20 kilograms of HALEU to the DOE means that phase one of the contract has now been completed and Centrus can move ahead with the second phase: a full year of HALEU production at the 900 kilograms per year plant.

In September, Orano revealed plans to extend enrichment capacity at its Georges Besse II (GB-II) uranium enrichment plant in France, and said it had begun the regulatory process to produce HALEU there.

Urenco is one third owned by the UK government, one third by the Dutch government and one third by two German utilities, E.ON S.E. and RWE AG.",world-nuclear-news.org,news,World Nuclear News (WNN),,0.2470588235294118,452862050,1,,eng-9549409

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into RWE AG's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.

Since the deal with E.On, RWE is refocused on power generation, mostly in Europe. It owns 38 gigawatts of power generation capacity: 28% from lignite and hard coal plants, 37% from gas plants, 40% from renewables including pumped storage and batteries. Besides Germany, RWE's power plants are chiefly located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United States for many onshore wind farms.

RWE AG has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2018. Dividends are currently distributed on a yearly basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.

As of today, RWE AG currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.73% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.00%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.

Over the past three years, RWE AG's annual dividend growth rate was 4.00%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 11.30% per year. Based on RWE AG's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of RWE AG stock as of today is approximately 4.66%.

To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, RWE AG's dividend payout ratio is 0.47.

RWE AG's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks RWE AG's profitability 6 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 8 years out of past 10 years.
