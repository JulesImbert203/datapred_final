The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub TRNLTTFMc1 was down by 0.01 euros at 34.92 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) by 0839 GMT, LSEG data showed.

The July contract TRNLTTFMc2 was trading 0.09 euros firmer at 35 euros/MWh.

The TTF day-ahead contract TRNLTTFD1 was 0.15 euros down at 34.95 euros/MWh. In the British market, the day-ahead TGRNBPD1 contract was up 0.5 pence at 84.00 pence per therm.

Current gas prices are factoring in a risk premium that lifts them above where fundamental drivers would suggest, one trader said.

Such fundamentals include gas storage at 70% of capacity, mild weather and Norwegian gas flows of 300 million cubic metres (mcm) per day, the last of which had dropped as low as 178 mcm/day because of maintenance outages over the past ten days.

""Extant risks remain in play from a geopolitical front while OMV supply risk and Russian LNG concerns will continue to loom over markets,"" LSEG analyst Wayne Bryan said in a weekly market report.

A ramp-up in Norwegian imports and stronger LNG send-out should lower prices, however, with LSEG forecasting Dutch day-ahead prices to average 33 euros/MWh and their British equivalent at 82 p/th next week.

Gas supply from Russia to Europe via Ukraine remains steady at 42.4 mcm/day.

Meanwhile, extreme temperatures across Asia are driving up liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand in the region, increasing competition for the fuel with European buyers.

In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract CFI2Zc1 rose by 0.37 euros to 75.85 euros a metric ton.

Renovation Asset Management owns more than 400 already-built EV charging points in Romania, with plans to increase their number to around 650 by 2026, as per the statement.

OMV Petrom announced its intention to fully acquire Renovation Asset Management in January.

Last month, OMV Petrom said it will test an innovative carbon capture and utilisation installation at its Petrobrazi refinery over a period of four months, starting in June. The company approved an all-time high investment budget of 8 billion lei ($1.74 billion/1.61 billion euro) for 2024.

OMV Petrom reported a 1.399 billion lei net profit for the first quarter of 2024, down 6% compared to the same period of last year.

Following the deal, Adnoc holds a 57 per cent stake in Sarb and Umm Lulu oil fields, while Austria's OMV and French energy major TotalEnergies have a stake of 20 per cent each, Adnoc said.

The total value of the deal was not disclosed. The Sarb and Umm Lulu concession in Abu Dhabi includes two major offshore fields.

""This award supports Adnoc's strategy to leverage strategic partnerships and advanced technologies to maximise value from Abu Dhabi's energy resources to ensure a secure, reliable and responsible supply of energy,"" Abdulmunim Al Kindy, Adnoc's upstream executive director, said.

The announcement comes amid deepening energy co-operation between the UAE and Azerbaijan.

Last year, Adnoc bought a 30 per cent stake in Azerbaijan's Absheron gas and condensate field in the Caspian Sea, as part of its strategic growth plans and entry into the international gas market.

It is also involved in the development of renewable projects in Azerbaijan through clean energy company Masdar.

Last year, Masdar signed agreements with Socar to develop renewable energy projects with a total capacity of 4 gigawatts in the Central Asian Republic. In October, Masdar inaugurated the 230-megawatt Garadagh Solar Park in Azerbaijan.

Rovshan Najaf, president of Socar, said the new concession deal is the company's first international upstream investment and it is committed to advancing its relationship with Adnoc ""even further and continue co-operating in many more projects of mutual interest"".

Adnoc is also focusing on expanding in other markets globally. Earlier this month, it bought a 10 per cent stake in Portuguese energy company Galp's Area 4 concession of the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique, marking its first investment in the African country.

The acquisition will entitle Adnoc to a share of the liquefied natural gas production from the concession, which has a combined production capacity of more than 25 million tonnes per annum, the Abu Dhabi-based energy company said.

Adnoc also acquired a 11.7 per cent stake in phase one of NextDecade's Rio Grande LNG project in Texas, marking its first investment in the US.

The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub was down by 0.01 euros at 34.92 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) by 0839 GMT, LSEG data showed.

The July contract was trading 0.09 euros firmer at 35 euros/MWh.

The TTF day-ahead contract was 0.15 euros down at 34.95 euros/MWh. In the British market, the day-ahead contract was up 0.5 pence at 84.00 pence per therm.

Current gas prices are factoring in a risk premium that lifts them above where fundamental drivers would suggest, one trader said.

Such fundamentals include gas storage at 70% of capacity, mild weather and Norwegian gas flows of 300 million cubic metres (mcm) per day, the last of which had dropped as low as 178 mcm/day because of maintenance outages over the past ten days.

""Extant risks remain in play from a geopolitical front while OMV supply risk and Russian LNG concerns will continue to loom over markets,"" LSEG analyst Wayne Bryan said in a weekly market report.

A ramp-up in Norwegian imports and stronger LNG send-out should lower prices, however, with LSEG forecasting Dutch day-ahead prices to average 33 euros/MWh and their British equivalent at 82 p/th next week.

Gas supply from Russia to Europe via Ukraine remains steady at 42.4 mcm/day.

Meanwhile, extreme temperatures across Asia are driving up liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand in the region, increasing competition for the fuel with European buyers.

In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract rose by 0.37 euros to 75.85 euros a metric ton. (Reporting by Nora Buli in Oslo Editing by David Goodman)",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,-0.003921568627450966,454843886,1,,

Sergiu Nistor: Accession to European Cultural Convention had significant impact on democratization of Romanian society

Romania's accession to the European Cultural Convention had a significant impact on the democratization of Romanian society, presidential adviser Sergiu Nistor said. He participated in a debate in the context of the meeting of the Steering Committee for Culture, Heritage and Landscape (CDCPP), which is taking place until Friday in Bucharest. ""The provisions of the conventions of the Council of Europe in the field of cultural heritage protection were, between 1998 and 2000, the benchmarks of the proposals of the Ministry of Culture for the Law on Historical Monuments, the Ordinance on the protection of world heritage in Romania. In turn, the recommendations of the Council of Europe in the field of cultural heritage inspired the secondary legislation in field. But beyond the principles and techniques of cultural heritage protection of the most diverse consistencies, the accession to the Council of Europe had a significant impact on the democratization of Romanian society and the building of a rule of law,"" said Nistor.

Most Read from Bloomberg

But in recent months stalled deals prompted speculation that Adnoc had lost momentum. Not so, says Klaus Froehlich, the former Morgan Stanley banker spearheading most of Adnoc's international expansion plans.

While the company will always be disciplined, it's ""full throttle ahead"" with its expansion and is pursing a ""healthy deal pipeline,"" Froehlich, Adnoc's chief investment officer, said in a rare interview earlier this month.

""Adnoc is executing on its plan and creating a portfolio of businesses across key verticals in gas, LNG, chemicals as well as renewables and little by little, the puzzle is now coming together,"" he said.

Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Al Jaber has transformed the country's top oil producer in the last few years. He has brought billions of dollars into the firm by selling shares in some of its key units and got international investors such as Brookfield Asset Management and KKR & Co to put money in the company's infrastructure. Al Jaber is also the main architect behind Adnoc's international expansion plan.

The energy giant has announced a series of acquisitions as part of a plan to invest $150 billion by 2027 to expand its footprint at home and spread its international reach.

This month has seen a flurry of activity. Adnoc purchased a stake in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG export project in Texas, its first US acquisition that also gives it a 20-year supply deal. The company also agreed to buy a 10% stake in a natural gas project in Mozambique. Separately, Adnoc sold $935 million worth of shares in a secondary offering of its drilling unit, increasing the company's free float to more than 16%.

""We are a big believer in gas and its future as a transition fuel. In order to optimize our LNG business today and to be a reliable supplier to our customers, we need to have positions globally,"" Froehlich said.

But in recent months Adnoc walked away from a potential acquisition in Brazil and suspended a deal in Israel. Talks over transactions with Germany's Covestro AG or Austria's OMV AG appear to have stalled.

""We go into every deal hoping that we can get it done but it won't be by compromising our standards on value and discipline,"" Froehlich said.

Adnoc's international ambitions are closely aligned with its domestic expansion strategy, where it's boosting LNG capacity in the Ruwais project, according to Froehlich, a former investment banker with Morgan Stanley.

Chemical Deals

In the chemicals sector, Adnoc is currently in talks to buy Germany's Covestro and -- in a separate transaction -- merge its domestic petrochemical firm Borouge with rival Borealis, which is controlled by Austrian oil and gas firm OMV. Froehlich declined to comment on the current status of talks with Covestro, but said the company was ""a great platform with a fantastic management team.""

Adnoc is a ""firm believer in the future of the chemicals industry -- either derived from hydrocarbons but then also increasingly from circular feedstocks and biomass,"" he said. Based in Leverkusen, western German, Covestro is working on sustainable forms of materials and uses recycled raw materials and renewable energy in its production.

Speaking about OMV, in which Adnoc acquired a 25% stake from fellow Abu Dhabi investor Mubadala, Froehlich said the Austrian oil and gas champion is a ""great investment into an under-appreciated company."" Adnoc sees long-term value in the partnership that Froehlich said is ""very crucial to us.""

Asked about a merger between Adnoc's petrochemical firm Borouge with OMV's polyolefin unit Borealis, Froehlich stressed both parties need to be aligned and find it beneficial. ""OMV and Adnoc can do a lot of things together,"" he said.

But in recent months stalled deals prompted speculation that Adnoc had lost momentum. Not so, says Klaus Froehlich, the former Morgan Stanley banker spearheading most of Adnoc's international expansion plans.

While the company will always be disciplined, it's ""full throttle ahead"" with its expansion and is pursing a ""healthy deal pipeline,"" Froehlich, Adnoc's chief investment officer, said in a rare interview earlier this month.

""Adnoc is executing on its plan and creating a portfolio of businesses across key verticals in gas, LNG, chemicals as well as renewables and little by little, the puzzle is now coming together,"" he said.

Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Al Jaber has transformed the country's top oil producer in the last few years. He has brought billions of dollars into the firm by selling shares in some of its key units and got international investors such as Brookfield Asset Management and KKR & Co to put money in the company's infrastructure. Al Jaber is also the main architect behind Adnoc's international expansion plan.

The energy giant has announced a series of acquisitions as part of a plan to invest $150 billion by 2027 to expand its footprint at home and spread its international reach.

This month has seen a flurry of activity. Adnoc purchased a stake in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG export project in Texas, its first US acquisition that also gives it a 20-year supply deal. The company also agreed to buy a 10% stake in a natural gas project in Mozambique. Separately, Adnoc sold $935 million worth of shares in a secondary offering of its drilling unit, increasing the company's free float to more than 16%.

""We are a big believer in gas and its future as a transition fuel. In order to optimize our LNG business today and to be a reliable supplier to our customers, we need to have positions globally,"" Froehlich said.

But in recent months Adnoc walked away from a potential acquisition in Brazil and suspended a deal in Israel. Talks over transactions with Germany's Covestro AG or Austria's OMV AG appear to have stalled.

""We go into every deal hoping that we can get it done but it won't be by compromising our standards on value and discipline,"" Froehlich said.

Adnoc's international ambitions are closely aligned with its domestic expansion strategy, where it's boosting LNG capacity in the Ruwais project, according to Froehlich, a former investment banker with Morgan Stanley.

Chemical Deals

In the chemicals sector, Adnoc is currently in talks to buy Germany's Covestro and -- in a separate transaction -- merge its domestic petrochemical firm Borouge with rival Borealis, which is controlled by Austrian oil and gas firm OMV. Froehlich declined to comment on the current status of talks with Covestro, but said the company was ""a great platform with a fantastic management team.""

Adnoc is a ""firm believer in the future of the chemicals industry -- either derived from hydrocarbons but then also increasingly from circular feedstocks and biomass,"" he said. Based in Leverkusen, western German, Covestro is working on sustainable forms of materials and uses recycled raw materials and renewable energy in its production.

Speaking about OMV, in which Adnoc acquired a 25% stake from fellow Abu Dhabi investor Mubadala, Froehlich said the Austrian oil and gas champion is a ""great investment into an under-appreciated company."" Adnoc sees long-term value in the partnership that Froehlich said is ""very crucial to us.""

Asked about a merger between Adnoc's petrochemical firm Borouge with OMV's polyolefin unit Borealis, Froehlich stressed both parties need to be aligned and find it beneficial.

Greenpeace Romania has released the study ""Life in the Black Sea - Pressures, Threats and Impacts"" by EPC Environmental Consultancy, a document that updates the main threats to marine biodiversity and highlights the need to carefully weigh their cumulative effect.

""We know that the Black Sea is already under great pressure, from war and sea mines to plastic pollution, and OMV is only intensifying the pressure on Black Sea species and habitats. OMV must stop Neptun Deep immediately!"" said Tanase.

The EPC study highlights, as a first conclusion, that the existence of the most vulnerable species - marine mammals - is threatened by the significant effects of the war, still insufficiently documented, and aggravated by other impacts of inadequately assessed projects.

""(...) we believe that more monitoring, expansion of protected areas, precaution and rigorous analysis are needed before expanding economic activities in the Black Sea area,"" said Marius Nistorescu, PhD ecologist, general manager of EPC Environmental Consultancy, in the release.

In the case of the Neptun Deep project, the study's authors consider it to pose a ""direct and immediate"" threat to the Black Sea.

""For the procedural flaws identified, Greenpeace has already taken legal action against OMV Petrom and Romgaz, the Tuzla Town Hall and Local Council, the Dobrogea Litoral Water Basin Administration and the Grigore Antipa National Institute for Marine Research and Development. The lack of real public consultation of the large coastal communities is also worrying, even though the consequences of the project, including potential accidents, would affect all the communities by the sea. OMV Petrom organised one pseudo-debate in Tuzla in January 2024. Moreover, the poor state of the older platforms operated by OMV Petrom, denounced by Greenpeace, shows the company's lack of interest in maintenance activities, with considerable risks of accidents,"" the expert analysis states.

Environmental activists believe that oil and gas exploration should only be carried out after rigorous environmental assessments, as it has the potential to significantly endanger sensitive species such as cetaceans (dolphins).AGERPRES(RO - author: Daniel Badea, editor: Andreea Marinescu; EN - author: Simona Iacob, editor: Maria Voican)",agerpres.ro,news,AGERPRES,,-0.3254901960784313,454774856,21,linkul pozei,eng-9614055

The European Union's embargo on the import of crude oil from Russia came into force in December 2022, followed by an embargo on oil products (including petrol and diesel) in February 2023. Meanwhile, natural gas imports fell more than 70% to 43 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023 from 150 bcm in 2021. And now reports have emerged that Germany and the Czech Republic are pushing the European Union to completely eliminate the remaining energy sources Europe imports from Russia.

According to Reuters, the two countries will ask Brussels to kick off regular high-level talks - potentially among countries' energy ministers to end the remaining imports of Russian energy.

Although the EU has largely replaced Russian gas with natural gas (mainly in the form of LNG) from the United States and Norway, the bloc still got 15% of its gas from Russia last year. Last year, Russia sent more than 15.6 million metric tons of LNG to the EU, good for a 37.7% jump compared to 2021, the year before Russia's Ukraine invasion. Reuters has reported that Berlin and Prague plan to make the call during a meeting of EU countries' energy ministers in Brussels on Thursday. The ministers are set to discuss the obstacles they are facing in phasing out the still-high Russian energy imports.

The latest move by Germany and the Czech Republic represents the latest attempt by EU members to work to fully sanction Russian gas imports. However, some EU members--including Hungary and Austria--remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. This implies that countries in support of a full ban can expect considerable pushback, with Hungary previously saying it would block such a move. The bloc has already banned imports of Russian coal and sea-borne crude oil, with exemptions for some land-locked countries.

Over the past two years, the EU and its Western allies including the United States have imposed a raft of sanctions on Russian energy commodities, including a $60-a-barrel cap on Russia's seaborne exports of crude oil. They have, however, avoided placing limitations on Russian gas as they tried to establish new source markets. Thankfully, the continent has been wildly successful at replacing Russian gas, managing to emerge from last winter with gas inventories at record levels. Europe's search for new markets has been aided by record natural gas production in the U.S. as well as reduced heating demand thanks to two consecutive mild winters. Norway and the U.S. have replaced Russia as Europe's biggest gas supplier: Last year, Norway supplied 87.8 bcm (billion cubic meters) of gas to Europe, good for 30.3% of total imports while the U.S. supplied 56.2 bcm, accounting for 19.4% of total.

Beaming with confidence, Europe is now getting ready to pull the trigger: Politico has reported that the European Commission has proposed sanctions on Russia's LNG sector as part of Brussels' 14th sanctions package against Russia. Under the proposed sanctions, EU countries would be prevented from re-exporting Russian LNG after receiving it and also ban EU involvement in upcoming LNG projects in Russia. The measures, however, wouldn't directly bar Russian LNG imports to the EU. Similar to previous sanctions, the proposed import ban is meant to disrupt Putin's ability to continue financing his war in Ukraine. Although Russian LNG accounted for just 5% of the bloc's energy consumption in 2023, it still netted the Kremlin ~$8 billion in revenues.

A full ban on Russian gas by the EU is very likely to trigger another gas price rally.

Natural gas has staged a big rally, with Henry Hub prices jumping from $1.61/MMBtu on 26th April to $2.66/MMBtu in Thursday's intraday session as markets increasingly price in more risk premium on the heated-up situation in the Middle East and Europe gets ready to ditch more Russian gas. Meanwhile, European natural gas prices eased slightly to €34 per megawatt-hour, close to the five-month high of €35.4 touched on May 23rd, amid expectations of lower supply amid robust cooling demand. The weatherman has forecast aggressive heatwaves in Europe later in the summer, with hotter temperatures expected in Northern Europe at the beginning of June, as well as excessive heat in France and Spain. Hot temperatures in Asia have also intensified bidding competition for LNG in major hubs, underscored by the 16.7% annual jump in imports from Japan in April.

Storage levels in Europe are also over 69% well above the 5-year average and are likely to be full ahead of winter. From a demand point of view the forecast is expected to improve in Europe with higher temperatures offsetting lower wind generation in the short term.

Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia have said the measure hurts their efforts to quit Russian gas, by making it more expensive to buy non-Russian fuel delivered via Germany.

In the joint document, the four countries urged the Commission to ""put words into concrete actions"" to solve the issue.

The Commission has prepared legal action against Germany over the tariff, seen as flouting the EU's single market rules, according to people familiar with the matter, but, so far, has not launched a lawsuit.

""Together with the scheduled end of transit of Russian gas via Ukraine by the end of this year, the levy will significantly reduce the security of supply of the whole CEE (Central and Eastern Europe) region,"" the four countries said.

Austria and Hungary remain heavily dependent on Russian gas. Austria's energy minister said in February the country is struggling to diversify its supplies and her ministry is looking into ending energy company OMV's long-term gas contract with Russia.

EU countries' energy ministers and the Commission are expected to discuss the German levy at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday, EU officials said.

Germany's economy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ministry has previously said the levy is nondiscriminatory and other EU countries had benefited during the energy crisis from Germany rapidly filling its gas storage, the biggest in the bloc.

The Commission said last week it was in talks with the German government, having raised doubts about the legality of the levy. EU single market rules forbid tariffs on trade between member countries.

That is how the Sudanese army enabled Lundin Oil's exploration, according to the first victim to appear in a Stockholm court in the landmark trial against two top executives of the Swedish corporation.

Lundin Oil's former chairman, Swede Ian Lundin, and the ex-CEO, Swiss national Alexandre Schneiter, stand trial for abetting grave war crimes allegedly committed from 1999 to 2003, when a consortium led by their company searched for oil in an area called Block 5A, which had not been under government control, the prosecutors argue.

The area where Pastor James Kuong Ninrew lived in Unity State, in what was then Sudan and is now South Sudan, used to be a peaceful rural community of cattle herders and farmers. But in 1998, people from the north started fleeing their homes and began flooding his village, Koch, Ninrew told the court. For two years, they were pouring into his Presbyterian church, looking for safety.

The Sudanese army and its allied militias ""would come with high-altitude Antonov planes to survey the area. Then they would bomb that area where they suspected there was any population.""

""When that stage was finished, they would come with helicopter gunships to the same area that was bombed, survey if there were any people left, and kill them. Ground troops would follow, consisting of the Sudan armed forces and militias, and clear the area,"" Ninrew said when questioned by prosecutors in the packed Stockholm courtroom.

Bit by bit, the army advanced southwards in this way toward Koch and built the road that Lundin Oil needed to set up camp and look for lucrative reserves, the priest recalled, echoing a central aspect of the indictment.

Ninrew described how he hid in a bunker the night the fighting eventually reached his village and the army's Antonov planes started dropping their crude barrel bombs. During that night, and the following morning, 18 people were killed and many more were wounded, he said.

Ninrew thought it was the right thing to do as a priest to stay as long as possible despite the fighting, against the advice from his superiors in the Presbyterian church. He later came to regret that decision since others chose to stay with him. ""Some people would not have died if I had made a different decision,"" Ninrew told the court.

Several of his relatives were killed, including his mother-in-law, and he lost property too. Eventually, he fled. ""Because I left, of course, my cattle were taken too,"" Ninrew added.

Despite his horrific account, Pastor James Kuong Ninrew said he was happy to be able to tell his story to the Stockholm District Court.

""I have been waiting for this moment since this case started, almost 20 years now. Some other people have been waiting for this moment and they have not been able to come. Some have passed on. So I consider myself to be lucky to be here,"" Ninrew told OCCRP after the trial session.

He said he hoped that other companies will behave better in the future thanks to the Lundin case.

""The ultimate goal is for justice to be served,"" said Ninrew, who is the first of 32 plaintiffs to take the stand in the mastodon case.

James Kuong Ninrew's firsthand account of the civil war in the area will be followed by several dozens of others. The trial started in September 2023 and is scheduled to go on for two and a half years until 2026. It is the longest in Swedish history.

The case also attracts attention because Sweden's former Prime Minister Carl Bildt used to be a board member for Lundin Oil. He has been called to testify but is not a suspect.

Another consortium partner, OMV in Austria, has recently also come under scrutiny because of the joint venture with Lundin Oil in Sudan.

According to the Swedish indictment, the oil execs were aware that the Sudanese government ""through its military and allied militia groups (...) began undertaking offensive military operations in and near Block 5A with the aim of taking control of the area for oil exploration.""

Thousands of people were killed and many more displaced. Villages were razed, and livestock stolen or killed. Ian Lundin and Alexandre Schneiter face lengthy prison sentences if convicted. They deny the charges. The defense team also argues that the indictment is far too vague and does not tie its clients to the alleged crimes.

Prosecutors also claim approximately US$240 million in forfeiture of criminal benefits from the remaining part of the Lundin corporation, a business entity called Orrön Energy. The company refutes the claim.

Alexandre Schneiter's defense attorney, Per E. Samuelson, admitted that Ninrew's story was heartbreaking but said it had factual errors and questioned its credibility. ""It is not consistent with what he has previously told when questioned by the police,"" Samuelson told OCCRP. The defense will get its opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiff later in the week.",occrp.org,news,OCCRP,,-0.02745098039215688,454609556,1,https://www.occrp.org/images/stories/CCWatch/daily/Pastor_James_Kuong_Ninrew.jpg,

Sanctions on Russian oil do not prevent crude from Central Asian countries from using the same infrastructure to reach Europe. / bne IntelliNews

Pipeline operators in Poland and Russia have reached an agreement that will enable transit of oil from Kazakhstan to continue to Germany, sources told Reuters on May 24.

Without the deal, transit might have been halted, as Russian oil transport operator Transneft warned Kazakhstan in April that deliveries to Germany could be ended by June 5 because of disagreement over certifying oil flow meters in Poland. Polish pipeline operator PERN had been concerned that it could violate Western sanctions against Russia, according to Reuters.

PERN, Transneft and Germany's PCK Schwedt refinery, which receives the crude, have agreed that a non-Russian company will service the oil flow meters on the Polish section of the Druzhba pipeline, according to Reuters. The company is from Slovakia.

Germany was formerly one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil in Europe, but stopped imports from the country at the end of 2022, securing seaborne alternatives and purchasing oil from Kazakhstan instead. However, Transneft's warning highlights that Germany remains dependent on Russia as a transit route for Kazakh crude. Around four-fifths of Kazakh crude is delivered to market through Russia, and Kazakhstan's progress in expanding the use of alternative routes, including across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan, has been slow.

The Schwedt refinery is responsible for the majority of fuel supply in Germany's capital Berlin. Under the supply deal with Kazakhstan, Germany is due to receive 1.2mn tonnes per year (24,000 barrels per day) of oil for the plant, equivalent to less than 10% of the refinery's processing capacity. The refinery is currently running at around 70-80% of capacity, sourcing the rest of its oil from German and Polish ports.

The contract for Kazakh oil will run until the end of this year.

Russia's largest oil company Rosneft previously held a majority stake in Schwedt, but the German government placed this interest under a trusteeship in September 2022. Rosneft's lawyers said the government was considering the nationalisation of the stake in February, but instead, Berlin opted to extend its trusteeship over the asset for a third time, until September this year.

There were concerns that nationalisation might cause Russia to seizure remaining German-held assets in Russia. In December 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the state's takeover of interests in Western Siberian gas fields held by Germany's Wintershall Dea and Austria's OMV.",intellinews.com,news,Intellinews                        ,,-0.1215686274509804,454594057,1,https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/1121_CEE_oil_pipelines_into_Europe_from_Russia_via_Ukraine_belarus_map_.jpeg,eng-9601510

Rompetrol is ready to offer a long-term off-take agreement.

Based on a similar project developed by OMV Petrom, the cost of the electrolyser plant needed by Rompetrol would be around EUR 190 million.

The (green) power supply shall be secured by the investor as well, but Rompetrol says it is considering the option of developing a 40MW solar park to partially support the project with renewable energy. Green power availability in the region (eastern part of Romania) is high anyway.

The plant's capacity is estimated to be at least 11,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year, requiring a renewable electrical power supply of approximately 75MW, Rompetrol estimates.

OMV Petrom is developing a similar project at its Petrobrazi refinery. With a capacity of 55MW distributed in two units of 20MW and 35MW, the project is estimated to cost EUR 140 million, out of which EUR 50 million comes from a grant under the National Resilience Plan (PNRR).

The two units at Petrobrazi refinery will generate some 8,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year.

The yield measured in toned of green H2 per year, per MW, is roughly equal among the two projects, and approximating that the project's price is proportional to its capacity, it means that the investor at Rompetrol should invest some EUR 190 million.",romania-insider.com,news,Romania Insider,,0.1843137254901961,454571148,5,https://cdn.romania-insider.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_large_image/public/2022-05/rompetrol_-_photo_radub85_dreamstime.com_.jpg,

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will purchase the stake in the Area 4 concession from Galp Energia SGPS SA, it said in a statement Wednesday. Galp will receive $650 million, and further contingent payments of as much as $500 million when two planned development phases go ahead, the Portuguese company said in a separate statement.

The agreement gives Adnoc a share of LNG supply, a fuel that it's betting on for future growth. The company is also scouring the world for deals, including the takeover of German chemical company Covestro AG and the merger of one of its units with a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

In Mozambique, Adnoc will get a share in the 3.5 million-ton-a-year Coral South development LNG export project that is currently in operation. A proposed expansion called Coral North could produce the same amount of fuel from a floating export vessel. Another project planned to be based onshore called Rovuma is projected to have capacity to produce 18 million tons of LNG a year.

It follows Adnoc's first acquisition in the US earlier this week when it picked up a share in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG project in Texas, along with supply from a planned expansion of the plant.

The deal into Mozambique -- where attacks by militant groups linked with Islamic State have ramped up near the project site -- is also the latest example of the UAE's move to boost its influence in Africa. Earlier this year, the country agreed to invest $35 billion in Egypt, potentially saving the economy.

In 2022, the UAE pledged $52.8 billion in foreign direct investments in Africa, when it first topped FDI rankings, according to data from fDi Markets. That figure fell to $44.5 billion in 2023 -- still nearly twice that of Beijing, which came in second.

Oil wealth

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

""We've made it very clear that we're interested in key sectors when it comes to low carbon solutions, renewables, natural gas and chemicals,"" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth, said in an interview Monday after the company announced the US deal. ""We're executing on our strategy and our strategy is clear. It's a milestone with hopefully more to come.""

Adnoc will take Galp's place in the Rovuma and Coral projects. The company will join Eni SpA, Exxon Mobil Corp., China National Petroleum Corp., Korea Gas Corp. and Mozambique's state producer Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos E.P.

Mozambique's Area 4 includes Eni's $7 billion floating Coral South Project that began shipping LNG in 2022 and a similar planned offshore production facility. Exxon said earlier this month that it expects a final investment decision for the onshore Rovuma project by the end of 2025.",clubofmozambique.com,news,Mozambique,,0.3098039215686275,454533706,1,https://clubofmozambique.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/adnoc.b.jpg,

If these plans materialise, they're likely to derail the energy transition in both countries, undermining EU efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

In Bulgaria, OMV Petrom, the Romanian subsidiary of Austrian fossil energy giant OMV, is seeking to resume exploration at the Han Asparuh offshore gas field. The project could pump 13 billion cubic metres (bcm) of fossil gas a year between 2030 and 2040, and 8 bcm a year by 2050. But the company would first need to register a discovery before its license, first granted in 2012, expires at the end of the year.

Since TotalEnergies withdrew from the project earlier this year, following Repsol's exit four years earlier, OMV Petrom is currently the project's only stakeholder. As Bankwatch previously revealed, the Bulgarian government has been actively seeking to acquire its own stake, but thus far without success.

Meanwhile, eager to push the gas project forward, Bulgarian authorities appear to be cutting corners. According to a recent report, plans are underway to 'unite exploration and production licenses under one agreement' in a bid to shorten the period between exploration and production. There are also plans to reduce the time it takes to carry out and appeal environmental impact assessments.

At the adjacent Neptun Deep field, also located in Romanian waters, OMV Petrom, together with Romanian state-owned company Romgaz, could begin drilling for gas even earlier. Set to officially start production in 2027, the project would see 100 bcm of fossil gas extracted over the next two decades. This would make Romania the EU's biggest fossil gas producer. At a time when the country - and the EU as a whole - need to slash fossil gas use, Romania's transmission system operator expects domestic gas consumption to grow significantly.

According to Romania's energy minister, an agreement reached by the Council of the European Union in March urging EU Member States to continue coordinated demand-reduction measures until April 2025 is 'more of a recommendation'. He confirmed Bucharest is intent on increasing fossil gas consumption, and to ensure demand grows, the Romanian authorities are now busy building new gas infrastructure, from power plants to distribution systems.

Although OMV Petrom is still awaiting a crucial environmental permit from the relevant authorities to go ahead with Neptun Deep, which could be issued any day, the future of both the Romanian and Bulgarian fossil gas projects remains uncertain. In Bulgaria, where fossil gas consumption is currently 3 bcm a year, any new fossil gas production would require a substantial increase in either domestic gas consumption or exports.

Yet, there is little appetite in Europe for long-term gas import deals beyond 2035. In fact, if the EU fully implements REPowerEU, its strategy aimed at weaning Europe off Russian gas imports, overall gas demand should halve by 2030. Therefore, given the estimated EUR 4 billion investment in each project, both of these ventures pose not only major climate risks but also economic risks due to the likely insufficient demand for all the gas produced.

In mid-May, the Bulgarian environment ministry held transboundary public consultations over the Neptun Deep project. Local community members, representatives of non-governmental organisations, and officials from both countries were invited to the coastal town of Kavarna to discuss the implications of the offshore gas project. Yet, the discussion was mostly dominated by OMV Petrom representatives, with little intervention from local authorities. Civil society members, including Bankwatch, raised concerns about the project's climate impact, the use of toxic chemicals, and the risk of accidents. But these concerns were largely brushed off by OMV Petrom representatives, who claim Neptun Deep will have no significant transboundary impacts. For their part, the Bulgarian authorities also expressed their agreement with the proposed measures.

Yet, both Han Asparuh and Neptun Deep pose direct threats to EU climate action. The environmental impact assessment for Neptun Deep makes the ludicrous claim that fossil gas drilling would generate 'negative emissions'. However, this claim is based on the assumption that the gas extracted would replace coal in energy production, and that Romania's operating coal capacity is three times higher than it actually is.

In reality, Neptun Deep's climate footprint over its projected 20-year lifespan, including its associated pipeline infrastructure, could reach a staggering 209 million to 227 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), primarily from gas combustion. This equates to around 10 million tCO2e per year, surpassing Romania's current annual coal industry emissions (8.6 metric tonnes in 2022, and decreasing). These findings, taken from a recent report commissioned by Greenpeace Romania, raise serious concerns about the validity of the predicted Neptun Deep figures.

For several years now, civil society have been sounding the alarm over the two projects, their climate price tag and the toll they would take on marine wildlife. In Romania, since the offshore law enabling the Neptun Deep investments was approved in 2022, environmental groups have sent open letters to the Romanian parliament, and warned on ￼￼ occasions of the project.

In late March, Greenpeace activists staged a direct action outside OMV Petrom's headquarters demanding the cancellation of Neptun Deep. A month earlier, Greenpeace filed a lawsuit against the companies behind Neptun Deep and the local environmental protection agency that had approved the project's onshore infrastructure for failing to assess the full scale of its environmental ramifications.

And it's not only activists and non-governmental organisations. Three years ago this month, the International Energy Agency warned that, if the world is to reach net zero emissions by mid-century, there can be no more new oil and fossil gas exploration and production. Failing to do so vastly increases the chances of a full-blown climate chaos. And in a recent report, the OECD concluded that Romania should not approve new oil and gas explorations, since falling gas demand in Europe after 2030 might pose a financial risk for new projects (see page 108). Yet, policymakers in Romania and Bulgaria, much like the profit-driven fossil fuel industry, are evidently looking the other way.

If realised, the Neptun Deep and Han Asparuh projects would cement both Romania's and Bulgaria's dependence on fossil fuels for far longer than the world can afford. While the Romanian government intends to use most of the Neptun Deep gas domestically, there are plans to export Black Sea fossil gas to neighbouring countries, most likely to Hungary and Austria. Under the pretext of energy security, gas exports could mean entrenching the dependence on dirty, expensive fossil gas throughout the region.

To make matters worse, Neptun Deep is being enabled by EU money. While the drilling itself might not be directly in receipt of EU funding, the supporting infrastructure - namely, the pipeline connecting the rig to the national grid, without which the project cannot function - has already received over EUR 230 million via the EU's Modernisation Fund and the European Investment Bank.

EU leaders have repeatedly been speaking of the need for the world to end fossil fuel subsidies. This was also one of the EU's priorities for the UN climate summit in Dubai in November 2023. A month earlier, however, the then Hungarian President Katalin Novak reiterated Budapest's intentions to buy fossil gas from Neptun Deep and called on the EU to finance it.

Sinking public money into any fossil fuel project is effectively stabbing the European Green Deal in the back. EU politicians and institutions should not endorse either Neptun Deep or Han Asparuh. Instead, they should call these projects out for what they really are: climate wrecking balls.

For now, the important decisions are set to be taken at the national level. Both the Romanian and Bulgarian governments need to acknowledge that pumping more fossil gas runs completely counter to the public interest and to immediately withdraw support for these planet-heating follies. In tandem, decision makers must prioritise sustainable energy for their citizens by investing in electricity grids, renewables, and energy efficiency.",bankwatch.org,news,Bankwatch,,-0.03529411764705881,454508057,29,https://bankwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WWW-Use-for-webpage-covers-blog-post-publications-PRs-1-24.png,eng-9614055

The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub was up 0.63 euros at 34.38 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) at 0907 GMT, according to LSEG data.

The July contract was up 0.60 euros at 34.75 euros/ MWh while the day-ahead contract gained 0.15 euros to 34.43 euros/MWh.

The British market was closed on Monday because of a national holiday.

""Gas seems to be in a bullish trend since April. No evidence of it stopping yet,"" one trader said.

The trend was likely to have been supported by a build up in long positioning and multiple risk factors, including the possibility that Austrian energy company OMV could lose its Russian gas supplies.

Another factor was an outage at Brunei LNG, a key supplier to Asia, the trader said.

Strong gas demand in Asia amid a heatwave and supply issues are likely to keep upward pressure on global gas prices, which are connected through competition for liquefied natural gas (LNG), said ANZ commodities strategist Daniel Hynes.

Closer to home, Norwegian gas supply on Monday was up 11 million cubic metres (mcm) per day from Friday after maintenance at the Oseberg field and Kollsnes processing plant ended over the weekend, LSEG analyst Ulrich Weber said.

""The wind forecasts have developed quite positively over the weekend, so that means less demand for gas for power,"" he added.

The BET-TRN UCITS ETF will start trading on the BVB on May 29, 2024 under the symbol ICBETNETF, InterCapital and Investimental said in a joint press release last week.

The new ETF will track the performance of the BET-TRN index, which includes twenty Romanian blue-chip companies such as Banca Transilvania [BSE:TLV], Hidroelectrica [BSE:H2O], OMV Petrom [BSE:SNP], and Digi Communications [BSE:DIGI]. The BET-TRN or ""Total Return Net"" index reflects both stock price changes and reinvested net dividends.

The price of one ETF share on the debut trading day will be around 70 lei ($15.2/14 euro).

Investimental, which acts as market maker for the ETF, will offer clients a lowered trading fee for an undetermined period. Investors can purchase the ETF at a reduced trading commission of 0.26%, along with the standard financial supervision authority (ASF) commission of 0.04%.

Since the start of 2024, the BET-TRN index increased by 16.45%, surpassing the S&P 500 and STOXX Europe 600, propelled by strong performances from both defensive stocks and entrepreneurial companies within the index.",seenews.com,news,See News,,0.1607843137254903,454490576,1,https://cdn.aiidatapro.net/media/f3/ff/5e/t780x490/f3ff5e65fa2975a493f53cdf9a4d1d79.jpg,

The average LNG price for July delivery into north-east Asia LNG-AS rose to $12.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), its highest level since mid-December and up from $10.90/mmBtu in the previous week, industry sources estimated.

""Spot LNG prices remain strong, supported by firm demand, unexpected outages and ongoing geopolitical risks,"" said Alex Froley, senior LNG analyst at data intelligence firm ICIS.

""Asian buyers have been increasing demand to take advantage of this year's lower prices relative to last year, with countries including China and Thailand seeing record import levels,"" he said.

Hot weather across some of the Asia region's markets has lifted power demand, supporting purchasing activity, said Samuel Good, head of LNG pricing at commodity pricing agency Argus, adding that temperatures in eastern China are forecast to remain above seasonal norms, supporting power gas burn.

In south-east Asia, some buyers recently issued tenders for longer-term cargoes, according to Charles Costerousse, senior LNG analyst at data analytics firm Kpler.

""The Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China (JKTC) region and India have in total received 14.06 million metric tons (mt) of LNG so far for May this year, compared to 17.07 mt for May last year,"" he said.

In Europe, gas market gains have tightened discounts to the Asian market substantially, amid maintenance outages in Norway and concerns over Russian pipeline supply after Austria's OMV OMVV.VI said that gas supplies from Russia's Gazprom GAZP.MM could be suspended in connection with a foreign court ruling.

""The market has to factor in the possibility of heightened geopolitical risks. In particular, the possibility of disruption to either Russian pipeline or LNG exports, or both. Austria's OMV said it could lose pipe supply from Russia. Europe, meanwhile, is considering restrictions on Russian LNG,"" ICIS' Froley said.

S&P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily North West Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in June on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $11.118/mmBtu on May 23, a $0.20/mmBtu discount to the July gas price at the Dutch TTF hub.

Argus assessed the July delivery price at $11.150/mmBtu, while Spark Commodities assessed the June delivery price at $11.003/mmBtu.

In the United States, Argus' Good said Freeport LNG production has held strong in recent days at levels that would suggest all three trains are operating near to capacity. Production at other U.S. terminals has also been largely steady.

LNG freight rates in the Atlantic saw the highest week-on-week increase this year and hit the highest level since the end of March at $48,250/day on Friday. The Pacific rates fell to $44,500/day, said Spark Commodities analyst Qasim Afghan.

Even so, ASX futures - where the big bets are made - show that prices will nevertheless be elevated, relative to history, reflecting the likelihood of less gas being available for power generation, Meridian chief financial officer Mike Roan said.

While it's not the most visible of markets, ASX futures plays a crucial role in how generators and big industrial users manage their risk.

""It's massively meaningful - that's the key point,"" Roan said.

""The reason is that it is the market's best view today of what wholesale electricity prices are going to be over any period,"" he told the Herald.

Futures prices change incrementally as events unfold.

""People are literally trying to access what electricity prices might be for the rest of 2024, then 25, 26 and 27.""

The futures market is distinct from the NZX-run wholesale market, which sees prices change on the half hour, and which can see huge fluctuations over the course of a day, depending on how full the hydro lakes are, or whether there is a cold snap.

The local spot market is based purely on supply and demand, where physical consumers and physical suppliers make offers and bids to determine the price of electricity in close to real-time.

In contrast, the futures market is unlimited. It's open to anyone, including speculators, who want to trade an electricity contract.

Roan said the key thing for futures is liquidity.

When enough parties participate in the market, that provides ""tension"" in the price formation process, Roan says.

In the year to February, contracts were traded representing 90 terawatt hours - about double the country's annual consumption - illustrating that the ASX has sufficient depth.

""There are lots of parties who trade ASX futures, so they don't consume energy in New Zealand and they may not even be Kiwis, but they help that price formation process on the ASX, which is trying to assess what electricity prices will be in the spot market over this period.""

As it stands, futures market pricing at the Otahuhu reference point has power trading at $234 per megawatt hour for 2024.

Roan said that's quite high, reflecting the unexpected cold snaps earlier this month that had Transpower calling for consumer restraint.

Further out, futures trading puts power at $201 per MWh over 2025, $173 per MWh in 2026 and $158 per MWh in 2027.

Roan said the declines over the next few years can be put down to the ""massive"" investment in new supply coming on board.

Of the $3 billion of renewable projects currently under way, Meridian is responsible for about half of that.

Meridian's $448 million Harapaki wind farm in Hawke's Bay is due to open ahead of schedule in late July, in time for the second half of winter.

Roan said the cost of electricity is forecast to come down materially over the next four years.

""The reason for that is the investment in new renewable that's going on right now.""'

But while the direction of travel is down, prices - as indicated by the ASX - are elevated relative to history.

""The $150 per MWh indicated for 2027 reflects investment in renewables, which means that we won't need as much gas or thermal generation, which is expensive.

""It is saying though that $150 is still a reasonably high price, by historical standards, driven by concerns over things like gas.""

In 2018, just before the availability of gas started to become an issue, electricity traded at about $80 to $100 per MWh.

While most of New Zealand's power comes from hydro and wind, gas and coal back up the system when the weather is not playing the game.

Meridian has in the past used ""swaption"" contracts to ensure security of supply when the country experiences drought conditions in the hydro lakes.

Roan said it's difficult to get anyone to take up a contract.

""So far we have not had anyone take us up, which worries us a bit.""

While there has been a wall of investment in renewables, there were nagging douts about gas.

""We have got [renewable] projects that we are pushing as hard and as fast as we can, but alongside that you still need a little bit of gas, and that's why people are worried.

""We want to get ahead of the demand that we can see,"" he said.

""But we are hopeful that the New Zealand gas industry is going to reinvest.""

The news from competing power generator Genesis this week that its KS-9 well in the Kupe field had come up short was a disappointment for the energy market.

Greg Sise, managing director of Energy Link, a consultancy, said it was the second blow for the sector.

The first was Pohokura, for which the latest development well delivered some new gas, but immediately went into decline.

Operator OMV says it will drill another sidetrack well from onshore to tap into another pocket of gas.

""So (a) it hasn't helped the market get more confidence around gas supply and (b) it serves to emphasise the importance of restoring confidence so the upstream producers will continue to invest in tapping into reserves, or perhaps finding some reserves in a new field,"" Sise said.

Brokers Forsyth Barr, in a research note, said Genesis Energy's worst fears about Kupe have been realised with the KS-9 well proving to be a dud.

""Production issues have not been resolved and so future Kupe production and earnings will be correspondingly lower than previously expected,"" the broker said.

""In addition to the earnings impact on Kupe, there is an indirect impact on the energy business, with less gas available to run its gas-fired Unit 5 plant,"" it said.

So you'll have to pardon me when I say I'm a bit lost on this.

To cut the long story short, I want the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N not because it looks cool or because the regular Hyundai Ioniq 5 bagged the Sgcarmart Car of the Year last year. It's simply because this silent sentinel is nothing short of sensational.

See, Hyundai's N division has made fundamental changes under the skin of the regular Ioniq 5, changes that have strengthened the car considerably by incorporating more welding points as well as adding adhesive for the sake of improved rigidity of 15 per cent to 20 per cent. All in good nature to ensure the car lives up to the 'N' badge.

The Ioniq 5 N, with its sporty low-slung disposition, is enhanced by an aggressive-looking front fascia and enlarged rear diffuser. Underneath it, according to Hyundai's Senior Executive, the steering column, subframe and chassis, among others, have all been beefed up, too.

What has also been beefed up, obviously, is the output of the car. Thanks to two electric motors -- one on the front axle and one on the rear to provide an all-wheel driven capability -- the Ioniq 5 N is good for a generous dose of 641bhp and 770Nm (with N Grin Boost).

As a result, the 0 to 100km/h dash is dispatched in just 3.4 seconds, just before the all-electric sports beefcake hits the top speed of 260km/h. I won't lie, the Ioniq 5 N is blistering quick, quicker than a lot of electric vehicles (EVs) on paper and it does feel that way.

But it's very easy to become cynical about how fast EVs are, especially when many of them are hasty on the straights, grippy enough around bends, but are lacking in character and engagement.

Thus, more than its smashing speed, it's safe to say that it's the way the Ioniq 5 N moves on the tarmac that separates itself from the rest of the pack. Its tight body control, communicative steering as well as astonishing grip make the car so connected and tied down to the tarmac (even as a passenger in the car).

During my time with the car doing sprint races, I suspect there'll be very little cars that can keep up, and that will easily put a smile on your face.

And if you're worried about range, the 84kWh battery will see to about 450km of range on a full charge. Of which, once you're down to the last 10 per cent, fast charging via a DC charger will take just 18 minutes for the car to be juiced up to 80 per cent.

The range of the car depends on how you pilot it, more so when there is a vast array of settings -- enough to make your head spin when you see them on paper -- but it's surprisingly easy to learn them with a result that's nothing less than phenomenal once you find a setting that wets your palate.

For starters, your three regular modes -- Eco, Normal and Sport -- are still there, but you do get to access different settings in the N menu via the infotainment screen. Here, from the settings of the steering weight and damper stiffness to the suspension and e-LSD, you are able to customise the driving experience to your heart's content.

And that's not all. Hyundai decided to introduce a system that mimics an eight-speed gearbox. Novel yet dubious and gimmicky at first, until you try it.

As a matter of fact, it doesn't take long before it sounds natural and real. Yes, real. And with this comes three different sounds you can choose from -- Ignition, Evolution (my favourite) and Supersonic -- under the N Active Sound+. Extremely silly, but it's giggly nonetheless when you have them turned on.

In a way, the Ioniq 5 N is that kind of addictive EV that has a sense of humour. The way the car bounces as you upshift at full throttle, accompanied by a faux exhaust sound, is simply exceptional, even if my time with the car was short.

It just wouldn't be possible and properly justified to get through all of the Ioniq 5 N's drive and customisable modes in just a handful of laps in eight different driving courses at HMG Driving Experience Centre, considering the car's first rate dynamics and monumental performance.

Thankfully, the opportunity to do an in-depth test drive will be possible, since the Ioniq 5 N is slated to be launched in Singapore in the fourth quarter of this year. The Open Market Value (OMV) of the car will be approximately $58,000, so there's a good chance the car will set you back between $250,000 and $300,000, inclusive of COE.

Would I get one with my own money? I would in a heartbeat, but the annual road tax worries me. If nothing is done by the Government to help ease the ownership of EVs, then owning an Ioniq 5 N alone will no longer make sense, since the annual maintenance of the car will outdo any monetary savings compared to a regular internal combustion engine vehicle.

I could choose to have a regular Ioniq 5, or Ioniq 6, or even any other EV for that matter, but they are nothing quite like the car you see here.

The Ioniq 5 N is a car that will make you smile, one that you can meddle with on the road without any guilt of pollution, one that can serve not just yourself as a driver, but also as a highly functional, spacious and comfortable car to your family.

And that's the fundamental aspect of the Ioniq 5 N. It's an all rounder that can let you speed off to the track early in the morning, do laps after laps at the circuit and then waft back home for dinner with the family in comfort.

So do please pardon me when I say that I don't even care if it's a giant hatchback or a compact SUV or a crossover. Yes, I am still a bit lost on how to categorise the Ioniq 5 N and, in all honesty, I really couldn't care less.",asiaone.com,news,AsiaOne,,0.2470588235294118,454408149,1,https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/May2024/0524_hyundai_m.jpg?h=2e181f1f&itok=1msJywjS,

Oil Posts Weekly Loss as Interest Rate Policy Spurs Fuel Demand Worries

Oil prices rose about 1% on Friday, but fell for the week on worries that strong U.S. economic data would keep interest rates elevated for a longer period, curbing fuel demand. The Brent crude July contract rose 76 cents to $82.12 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled 85 cents higher to $77.72. For the week, Brent closed down 2.1%, WTI settled down 2.8%. Worries over Federal Reserve interest rate policy and last week's bump in US crude oil inventories weighed on market sentiment. Minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting released on Wednesday showed policymakers questioning whether interest rates were high enough to tame stubborn inflation. Some officials were willing to raise borrowing costs again if inflation surged. Consumer sentiment also fell to a five-month low on mounting fears about borrowing costs staying high. At face value, pessimism among households would imply slower consumer spending, though the relationship between the two has been weak. Oil demand is still robust from a broader perspective, analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note, adding they expect total oil liquids consumption to increase by 1.5 million barrels per day this year.

In the British market, the front-month price TRGBNBPMc1 was down 1.33 pence at 84 pence per therm.

""The latest temperature forecast is mostly in line with the previous weather run, expecting temperatures to fluctuate between 0.8 degrees (Celsius) and 3.8 degrees above the seasonal norm for the next 14 days,"" LSEG analyst Tomasz Marcin Kowalski said in a daily market update.

LSEG data showed total Norwegian export nominations increased by 18 million cubic metres/day (mcm/d), to 286 mcm/d due to higher available capacity at the Kollsnes gas processing plant and Troll gas field.

Prices had risen over the past few days on fears that Russia could halt gas flows to Austria's OMV after the company said on Wednesday supplies from Gazprom GAZP.MM may be suspended in connection with a foreign court ruling, without identifying the case.

Traders said technically the price rise had looked overdone and there could be some profit taking on Friday.

The relative strength index (RSI) of the Dutch front-month gas contract had risen above 70 on Thursday according to LSEG data, a threshold indicating that a stock or commodity may be due for an downwards correction.

The RSI had risen fallen back below 70 by Friday morning, the data showed.

Imports from Norway are around 40%, and as the threat of outages continues, it has sustained prices.

During 2024, the average price has been 68.50, below the average price at the same time last year. The forward curve grows sharply upwards until the end of 2025 with December contract quoting above 109. Austria's OMV AG might stop payments to Gazprom soon, and that would cut 80% of supplies to the country.

Furthermore, Slovakia and Hungary are also dependent on Russian gas, despite the move to replace it as a result of the war in Ukraine, which was the main transit zone. Most gas into Europe from Russia is now provided via Turkey, and has not been affected by sanctions so far.

So, the geopolitical situation seems to be the main factor driving prices, as storage is still at good levels.

The contract has finally broken the key level of 74.90, and this week, it has surprised the market with a bullish breakout, placing prices well above the 10- and 20-unit exponential moving averages (EMAs). From here, the next strong dynamic resistance will be the 50 EMA (currently marking 95.80), and we would need to go as far back as December 2022 for the most recent breakout from that level.

The weekly RSI at 53.47 is still in the ""neutral"" area; however, it is trending up and following the direction of prices. For now, all signs are pointing upwards.

Robusta Coffee 10-T (RMN24), +11.67%: In the last four sessions, we see a confident bullish rebound, breaking all the 10, 20 and 50 averages. Mind the 4,000 level, which so far has acted as good resistance. Breaking it upwards will set the next target to 4,300.

This week's announcement that Vietnam 2024/2025 robusta coffee crop will be the lowest in 13 years (24 million bags) is fueling the last rebound. There are projections of yet another robusta global deficit for 2024/2025 of 4.6 million.

Brazil production in contrast has been revised up from Conab (Brazil's National Supply Company) to up to 58.8 bags. Given the dryness reports in Mina Gerais that might bit too optimistic, and the supply might be tight for this season.

Rapeseed (XRQ24), +4.54%: European Rapeseed is in a solid uptrend that started on Feb. 26 and has used the 10 and 20 EMA as effective support. The daily RSI at 62.77 is still validating the trend.

EU Commission grain trade data shows that rapeseed imports are below last year's volume. 2023-24 imports are at 4.9 Mt, which is 1.9Mt less than previous season.

Australia has exported 60% less to the EU as a result of dryness in a context of strong demand from EU crushers that are hitting record volumes. Fundamentals are clearly supporting this trend for now.

Worst European Commodity Performers This Week

Crude Oil Brent (CBQ24), -3.12%: Brent contracts are trading below the 10, 20, and 50 EMAs with a clear bearish bias in the last 5 sessions. The 79.5-80 area should provide a first support it the trend continues.

Demand is low currently at the start of the driving season, and with no close prospect of interest rate cuts to stimulate it. All attention is now focused on the next OPEC meeting on June 1.

VSTOXX Futures (DVM24), -25%: With lows hitting the 13 level, we are approaching extremely low volatility in the equity sector, down to levels not seen since January 2024. Previous to that, volatility had remained higher since January 2020.

The 50 EMA indicates 19, so this could be a good time for those looking to pick up cheap options on equities.

Cobalt (U8M24), -2,44%: Cobalt has its production concentrated in two countries. It had its last boom in May 2022 (high at 81,940), and a subsequent crash at the current 26,945.

The metal is near its cheapest in the last 5 years, and China has taken notice. Cobalt is a byproduct of copper and nickel production, and it's in demand among the defense, electric vehicle (EV), and communication industries.

There is a massive surplus in the market in 2024, which has produced the current crash, with overproduction reported in the Republic of Congo and Indonesia. Congo supplies 77% of theglobal market with around 170,000 tons just last year, and the current surplus in the market for 2024 is estimated at 35,000 tons.

The crash in prices has not stopped Chinese miners in Congo, as they benefit from state support. China's state stockpiler is ramping up demand, as it plans to acquire 15,000 tons at around USD$12.50-$13.80 per pound for stockpiling, and presumably for military use.

At the current levels, and with expected EV demand picking up, we could be close to a turnaround in this bear market.

How to Trade Cobalt

Futures contracts on this metal have very low liquidity, and the only realistic options for retail traders are on the ETF sector - though there is nothing specifically on cobalt 100%, either miners or on futures.

That said, two ETF options are the Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) and the ProShares S&P Global Core Battery Metals ETF (ION).

Markets on cobalt are ripe with opportunity at these levels; however, be sure to mind the liquidity if you are going to jump in.

For this Mahindra is leveraging Unity Catalog governance to make its platform available to a wide range of users in a secured manner. These outcomes are among many that underscore Mahindra AI's transformative impact on business operations, customer experiences, and employee productivity and reaffirm Mahindra Group's #RiseWithTech philosophy.

OMV is on a mission to become an integrated supplier of sustainable fuels, chemicals and materials. It has embarked on a transformative journey to revolutionize its market research methodologies in response to the fast-evolving shift towards sustainability in the energy sector. As a first step, OMV's Data Liberation & AI team developed the ""Autonomous Market Research Bot"". The bot is powered by a swarm of generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) deployed on Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. The innovative bot leverages LLMs available in the Azure OpenAI and Databricks Marketplace, revolutionizing its approach to market analysis by enabling real-time research, sentiment analysis, and consumer behavior insights.

By reducing the time, it takes to generate market research reports from days to minutes and automating previously manual tasks, the bot improved the accuracy of curating market insights and generated significant cost savings for OMV Fuels and Feedstock business. The bot's architecture included the Chainlit UI for user interaction and a system of delegation bots for specialized tasks -- all integrated through the Microsoft's Autogen framework for efficient communication among GPT bots. This project highlighted OMV's leadership to invest in next-gen technology to support future growth by enhancing decision-making, optimizing operations, and setting the stage for future innovations.

Workday, a leading provider of solutions to help organizations manage their people and money, wanted to address a time-consuming HR task ripe for automation -- the creation of job descriptions. The initiative focused on developing a generative AI application that would transform Workday's approach to creating HR content. The team collaborated with Databricks to create an LLM capable of transforming inputs like job titles, company names, and required skills into new job descriptions. By training this custom LLM on a vast repository of Workday's job requisition data, the team developed a model that met expectations while sidestepping the substantial costs and security risks associated with external vendor models. Databricks provided a platform for developing the innovative ETL, training, inference, and evaluation pipelines crucial to the project's success. The LLM is now available to a small group of select Workday customers as part of an early access program, and feedback so far has been positive.

Sterling is up 1.8pc against the dollar so far this month to trade at more than $1.27, which would be its best performance this year.

The pound, which is up against most major currencies, has been lifted by expectations that interest rates could be cut as late as December.

Traders have drastically reduced bets that the Bank of England could begin cutting interest rates over the summer after inflation figures came in higher than expected in April.

Before the inflation data, which showed prices rose at a rate of 2.3pc in April, a first cut had been given a 50pc chance of happening in June and was priced in by August at the latest.

Thanks for joining us today. We'll be back on Tuesday to cover the latest from the markets, after the bank holiday. In the meantime, I'll leave you with the news that Kabosu, a Japanese dog who became an internet sensation, has died at 18.

Kabosu became recognisable as the face of Dogecoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that began as a satirical critique of the 2013 crypto frenzy.

But the token jumped in value after Tesla boss Elon Musk, a proponent of cryptocurrencies, began tweeting about it in 2020. Since then the billionaire has repeatedly promoted the coin.

Dogecoin added as much as $4bn (£3.1bn) to its market value last year when the billionaire, who bought social media site Twitter in 2022, briefly replaced Twitter's blue bird logo with an image of Kabosu. Musk subsequently renamed Twitter as X.

With a market capitalisation of around $23.6bn, Dogecoin is now the ninth biggest cryptocurrency, according to data site Coingecko.com.

""The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable,"" Dogecoin posted on social media site X on Friday.

TotalEnergies boss rejects activist demands with case for new oil fields

The boss of TotalEnergies told shareholders Friday the energy giant needed to develop new oil fields to meet global demand, as the French company's AGM was picketed by climate activists.

Patrick Pouyanne warned that higher oil prices prompted by insufficient fossil fuel output ""would quickly become unbearable for the populations in emerging countries, but also in our developed countries"".

Demand for oil was growing in line with the global population, he said.

But Mr Pouyanne also promised that TotalEnergies would pursue its ""balanced strategy"" of developing both fossil fuel and low-carbon energy production.

TotalEnergies had provided proof that it was possible ""to be a profitable, or even the most profitable, company while pursuing a transformation"" towards cleaner energy, he said.

Climate activists had gathered hours before the general meeting opened, with Greenpeace members unfurling a ""Wanted"" banner depicting Pouyanne and calling him ""the leader of France's most polluting company"".

Climate activists say TotalEnergies is contributing to global warming, to the destruction of biodiversity and to violations of human rights through its gas and oil activities.

US stock markets rise despite worries about interest rates

European and Asian stock markets have fallen today following Wall Street losses on Thursday as better-than-expected US data compounded worries that the US Federal Reserve will hold off on cutting interest rates this year.

US stocks opened higher this afternoon.

Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at City Index, said that traders ""were happy to book a profit"" on tech stocks on Thursday, with many ""likely to have taken Friday off"" ahead of Monday's Memorial Day holiday. The technology sector was boosted by strong results at US tech giant Nividia, which propelled the company's shared more than 10pc in early trading yesterday.

European and US indexes have rallied to new records in recent days thanks to solid first quarter earnings by companies and their positive outlook despite the fact it is looking increasingly unlikely the Fed will begin cutting interest rates this year.

Joshua Mahony, an analyst at Scope Markets, said:

Other data showing the US economy is coping with high interest rates, thus reducing any pressure on the Fed to cut them, has also been denting confidence in a quick reduction in borrowing costs.

Today it was US durable goods orders for April, which rose 0.4 percent month-on-month excluding the volatile transportation sector.

That followed data yesterday showing that services sector showed activity rose at its fastest pace in a year, while the factory sector also beat forecasts.

The data indicates the world's top economy remained resilient, quelling the excitement sparked by last week's news that the consumer price index slowed in April after three months of topping forecasts.

At this point, I will wish you well as you head towards the bank holiday weekend and leave you in the hands of Alex Singleton.

A quick look at the markets before a sign off shows the FTSE 100 is down 0.2pc, while the domestically-focused FTSE 250 is now up 0.5pc.

Wall Street has swung higher but European stocks fell as investors fret over data suggesting the US Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for longer.

The pound is up 0.2pc on the dollar today to $1.273, leaving it up 1.8pc so far this month.

Brent crude oil is now up 0.6pc today towards $82 a barrel.

Biden borrowing at 'unsustainable levels,' warns Fed official

The Biden administration is borrowing at ""unsustainable"" levels, a Federal Reserve governor has warned, risking higher interest rates.

Christopher Waller warned that any change in the demand for Treasury bonds could have an impact borrowing costs.

Speaking at the Reykjavik Economic Conference in Iceland, he said the US ""is on an unsustainable fiscal path"".

He warned that there would be ""upward pressure"" on interest rates ""if the growth in the supply of US Treasuries begins to outstrip demand,"" as it would mean ""lower prices and higher yields"".

It comes after President Joe Biden cancelled more than 160,000 student loans, bringing the total amount of debt forgiveness under his administration to $167bn (£131.3bn).

Wall Street opens higher despite inflation fears

The main US stock indexes opened higher despite signs of persistent inflation that rekindled caution.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 23.97 points, or 0.1pc, at the open to 39,089.23.

The S&P 500 opened higher by 13.61 points, or 0.3pc, at 5,281.45, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 50.76 points, or 0.3pc, to 16,786.79 at the opening bell.

Safety warnings from Boeing staff jump sixfold since mid-air blowout

The number of safety concerns raised by Boeing staff increased six fold in the wake of the mid-air blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight.

The planemaker said in its annual safety report that submissions had increased dramatically in the two months following the incident on January 5.

It comes as almost $9bn (£7.1bn) was wiped off the value of Boeing after it warned it will burn through cash this year and grapple with further delays to deliveries of its new plane.

Brian West, chief financial officer, said he expected cash flow to be negative during 2024, largely owing to delayed deliveries of the 737 Max model as Boeing slows production after a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet in January.

Car maker to cut hundreds of jobs as electric vehicle demand wanes

US luxury car maker Lucid will cut about 400 jobs in the coming months amid waning demand for electric vehicles.

The reduction of about 6pc of its global workforce will cost between $21m and $25m (£16.5m and £19.7m).

The job cuts come as the wider electric car industry rides out a slowdown in sales.

Tesla announced last month it would cut 10pc of its workforce, while smaller rival Rivian has announced several rounds of layoffs.

Car manufacturers are expected to fall short of the government's target for electric vehicle (EV) sales this year, with approximately 19.8pc of the new car market predicted to be battery-electric, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

European industry figures earlier this week showed that Tesla's sales in the UK and Europe had fallen by 8pc in the first four months of the year.

Pound rises as interest rate cuts not expected until after election

The pound is on track for its best month since November as the timing of interest rate cuts has been pushed back until after the election.

Sterling is up 1.6pc against the dollar so far this month, which would be its best performance this year.

The pound, which is up against most major currencies, has been lifted by expectations that interest rates could be cut as late as November.

Traders drastically reduced bets that the Bank of England could begin cutting interest rates as early as June after inflation figures came in higher than expected in April.

Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates until September, says Goldman Sachs

The US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September, Goldman Sachs has said, pushing back its previous prediction.

The Wall Street titan had expected borrowing costs in the US to be reduced in July but its outlook has been altered by strong economic data.

Economist Jan Hatzius said: ""Earlier this week, we noted that comments from Fed officials suggested that a July cut would likely require not just better inflation numbers but also meaningful signs of softness in the activity or labour market data.""

Goldman Sachs had been one of the last banks on Wall Street betting the Fed would start lowering interest rates in July.

Earlier this week, Nomura Securities also pushed its prediction from July to September, saying ""the threshold for rate cuts appears to have risen"".

Eurozone interest rates on track to be cut in June, says German policymaker

The European Central Bank is on track to cut interest rates from their record highs at its next meeting, the head of the Bundesbank has said.

Interest rates in the single currency bloc have stood at 4pc since September last year but traders are betting there is a 91pc chance that this will be reduced in June as inflation in the bloc stands at 2.2pc.

Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel appeared optimistic of a cut as he spoke on the sidelines of the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Stresa, Italy.

He said: ""If the situation stays as it is now and the projections don't say something completely different -- but I don't assume that -- then the probability increases that we will see the first interest-rate step.""

He added that even if rates are cut ""it's important to me that this decision is made in such a way that no autopilot can be derived from it.""

US stocks are on track to rise at the opening bell despite data showing signs of persistent inflation.

After riding high on Nvidia's blowout revenue forecast, Wall Street's main indexes turned lower on Thursday after strong economic data meant traders reduced bets of interest rate cuts this year.

The blue-chip Dow logged its biggest one-day drop since March 2023 on Thursday while the benchmark S&P 500 recorded its worst session in over three weeks. Both the indexes were set for weekly losses after four straight weeks of gains.

Investor focus today will be on more economic data, including durable goods for April and the University of Michigan's final consumer sentiment, along with remarks from Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2pc, the S&P 500 was up 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 had gained 0.2pc.

Pharmaceutical giant GSK has won a potentially expensive personal injury case in the US over its heartburn medicine Zantac.

Angela Valadez, an 89-year-old woman living in the state of Illinois, claimed that prolonged use of Zantac caused her to develop colon cancer.

But a jury on Thursday determined that the medication was not responsible, and the judge rejected her request for $640m (£503m) in damages.

The decision is the latest in a long-running saga surrounding Zantac, which is the brand name for the drug ranitidine.

The product reduces the amount of acid the stomach makes, and was used to treat indigestion, heartburn and acid reflux.

Zantac was a best-seller in both the UK and US after its approval in the early 1980s but in 2019 a laboratory in Connecticut reported that it had found ""extremely high levels"" of NDMA when it heated ranitidine.

NDMA is a substance found in cigarettes and processed foods, and is thought to increase the risk of developing cancer.

The drug was discontinued in the UK and the US as a precaution the next year.

Oil prices have fallen after Opec+ cartel of oil producing nations pushed back the date of its next meeting, where it is due to discuss supply cuts.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, was down 0.6pc to below $81 - its weakest since February - while US-produced West Texas Intermediate fell towards $76.

Brent reached a 2024 peak of $91.17 early last month.

It comes as the Opec+ group pushed back its output policy meeting by a day to June 2 and will convene online, rather than in Vienna.

Opec+ oil producers are making voluntary output cuts totalling about 2.2m barrels per day (bpd) for the first half of 2024, led by Saudi Arabia rolling over an earlier voluntary cut.

It comes against a backdrop of rising output from the United States and other non-member producers, while worries over demand have remained in focus as major economies grapple with high interest rates.

Sources from countries that have made voluntary supply cuts told Reuters this month that an extension was likely.

Pictured: 'Wanted' poster of TotalEnergies boss unfurled by climate activists

Five Greenpeace activists have climbed up a building near TotalEnergies' Paris headquarters and unfurled a banner criticising the oil giant's climate change strategy as it holds is annual shareholder meeting.

The climate group opposes Total's continued exploration of oil and gas, despite a ""climate emergency"", a Greenpeace spokesman said.

The banner included a large photo of Total chief executive and chairman Patrick Pouyanne under a 'Wanted' heading.

Barriers had already been erected around the entrances of Total's offices in Paris' La Defense district on Thursday evening, with employees told to work from home on Friday.

Total shareholders are due to vote later on whether to approve the progress Total has made on its sustainability and climate goals for 2030.

Activists and climate-focused investors have ramped up pressure on the world's leading oil and gas companies in recent years, frequently derailing shareholder meetings.

Earlier this week climate activists disrupted Shell's annual shareholder meeting, chanting: ""Shell kills.""

The pound was steady after data showed wet weather hit consumer spending far more than expected in April.

Sterling was last flat against the dollar at $1.27, having traded as high as $1.276 after Wednesday's data showed inflation eased to 2.3pc in April, above forecasts if a drop to 2.1pc.

Sterling has been strengthened after traders reduced bets on of a June rate cut by the Bank of England to below 10pc, from around 50pc before Wednesday's inflation data.

Today, the Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes dropped by 2.3pc in April after a 0.2pc fall in March, which was far worse than a predicted fall of 0.5pc.

The pound was little changed against the euro, which is worth 85p.

Starmer: We do not have to raise taxes if Labour win

Sir Keir Starmer did not accept claims he would have to raise taxes, make spending cuts or change Labour's fiscal rules if his party wins power.

The Labour leader said he did not agree with the findings of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme:

He claimed previous governments had gone ""round and round in circles"" with short-term solutions. Sir Keir added:

Gas prices are on track for their largest weekly gain in a month amid concerns about supplies from Norway and Russia.

Dutch front-month futures, the benchmark contract on the continent, has risen as much as 1.3pc and was on track for an increase of more than 10pc this week.

The UK equivalent was up more than 13pc on the week.

It comes after an unplanned outage at a major plant in Norway, which is the largest supplier to Europe.

Meanwhile, Austrian supplier OMV has warned of a risk to flows from Russia after a court ruling this week banning payments to Kremlin-backed producer Gazprom.

It comes as prices are also rising in Asia as a heatwave increases demand for air conditioning, pushing up global competition for liquified natural gas.

UK stocks fell nearly 1pc in early trading as investors were unnerved by weak retail sales and robust US economic data that fuelled worries that interest rates will stay high for longer.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index dipped as much as 0.9pc and was poised for a fourth consecutive session in the red, which is its longest losing streak in more than three months. The index was set to log a second consecutive week of declines.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped 0.4pc and was also on track for a fourth straight day of losses.

It comes as retail sales in the UK fell by 2.3pc - much more than the 0.5pc expected.

Meanwhile, robust economic data from the US showed business activity in May accelerated to the highest level in over two years.

Investors took some profits following a near 8pc climb in London stocks over the past five weeks.

Among stocks, AJ Bell fell 4.5pc to the bottom of the FTSE 250 after the investment platform's founder sold 7.5m shares in the company.

National Grid slumped 10.3pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after a nearly 11pc drop on Thursday when it announced plans to sell more shares.

Intertek Group was up 2.9pc to lead the FTSE 100 after the product testing firm reconfirmed its forecast for 2024.

Retailers need to target consumers of all budgets, say analysts

After the sharp fall in retail sales last month, Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail at Deloitte, said:

The FTSE 100 dropped as trading began after figures showing retail sales fell much more than expected last month.

The UK's blue chip stock index was down 0.8pc to 8,272.84 while the midcap FTSE 250 fell 0.3pc to 20,579.35.

Retail sales fell by 2.3pc between March and April amid poor weather, which was far more than the 0.5pc drop predicted by analysts.

The boss of Abrdn will step down after four years in charge in which he dropped the vowels from the company's name in a controversial rebrand.

Stephen Bird will leave after a turbulent period during which the asset manager was ejected from the premier FTSE 100 index after its shares plunged, launching plans this year to axe £150m in costs.

A statement to shareholders said: ""Following the significant strategic repositioning of the company, the board and group CEO, Stephen Bird, have together agreed that it is the right time for Stephen to hand over the reins to the team he has assembled over the last four years to drive the business forward.""

The asset manager's chief financial officer Jason Windsor will become interim chief executive, with Mr Bird stepping down at the end of June.

Under Mr Bird's tenure, Abrdn was forced to defend its decision to drop most of the vowels from its name following claims that the brand makeover has made it a victim of ""corporate bullying"".

Critics have joked that the company developed a case of ""irritable vowel syndrome"" and have referred to Stephen Bird, the company's chief executive, as Stphn Brd.

Consumer spending to recover this year, economists insist

Retail sales fell by more than expected during a washout April, official figures show, but economists think the outlook for the sector is ""bright"".

Sales volumes fell by 2.3pc last month, far more than the 0.5pc decline that had been predicted by analysts.

However, separate data showed consumer confidence has continued its ""upward momentum"" despite the cost-of-living crisis remaining a daily reality for households.

GfK's long-running consumer confidence index rose by two points in May to minus 17.

Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that ""as inflation falls further this year, rising real household disposable income should boost retail activity throughout the rest of 2024"". He added:

North Sea engineering group rejects third £1.5bn takeover bid

A North Sea engineering group has rejected a fresh £1.5bn bid from a Dubai-based rival, as low valuations on the London Stock Exchange prompt a wave of foreign takeover attempts.

John Wood Group has rejected a third offer of 220p per share from Sidara, up from previous offers of 212p and 205p earlier this month.

It said the new bid ""continued to significantly undervalue the group and its prospects"".

The Aberdeen-based company is a global player in oil, gas, renewable energy and in the production of minerals such as lithium, which are seen as critical for reaching net zero. It employs around 35,000 people in 60 countries.

Shares are still up 10pc since the first takeover offer was first disclosed on May 8.

Falling bills offer small comfort to struggling households, say Citizens Advice

As the latest Ofgem price cap indicated household bills will fall by 7pc from July, Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty said:

Retail sales fell in Britain last month, official figures show, in a blow to the Prime Minister as he argues the economy has ""turned a corner"".

Sales volumes fell across most sectors, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a decline by 0.2pc in March.

Clothing retailers, sports equipment, games and toys stores, and furniture stores were particularly hit by poor weather, which reduced footfall.

Household energy bills will be 7pc lower on average from July compared to the previous three months in England, Scotland and Wales, after Ofgem announced its latest price cap.

The price cap ""assumes"" a standing charge - the flat amount all households pay to have energy delivered to their homes - of £334 for a dual fuel customer and £369 for those who pay by standard credit, unchanged from the last price cap.

Energy bills to drop by £122 a year as Tories vow more support for households

Household energy bills will fall by £122 a year as Rishi Sunak pledges to make it easier for customers to get the best deal in his election campaign.

The Ofgem price cap will fall from £1,690 per year to £1,568 from July 1, leaving energy bills at their lowest level since before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine triggered an energy shock for European economies.

The price cap had been set at £1,216 a year over the winter of 2021 to 2022, before the war sent energy costs rocketing, with the Government forced to intervene to limit bills to £2,500 a year during the peak of the fuel crisis.

It comes as the Prime Minister seeks to put falling energy bills at the centre of the election campaign.

The Tories will vow to make price comparison websites easier to use and consider telling the regulator Ofgem to publish league tables showing how long energy firms take to respond to customer complaints.

Thanks for joining me. We begin the day with the announcement of an impending fall in energy bills.

The Ofgem price cap will fall by £122 to £1,568 from July 1, meaning the average household electricity and gas bills will be at their lowest level since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

What happened overnight

Asian stocks fell as strong US economic data bolstered the prospect of interest rates staying higher for longer and the Federal Reserve taking its time in cutting rates.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1pc and was on course for a 1.5pc weekly decline, snapping its four-week winning streak. Japan's Nikkei fell 1pc.

In America, the S&P 500 slid 0.7pc to 5,267.84, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading US companies finished down 1.5pc at 39,065.26. Meanwhile, the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4pc to 16,736.03.

US Treasury yields turned higher after data suggested American business activity has picked up and the labor market remains tight, supporting the Fed's ""higher for longer"" interest rate narrative. The benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds reached a yield of 4.4787pc, from 4.434pc late on Wednesday.

Tokyo stocks opened lower on Friday, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index tumbling 1.50pc to 38,518.54 in early trade, while the broader Topix index slipped 1.28pc to 2,719.49.

Sterling is up 1.8pc against the dollar so far this month to trade at more than $1.27, which would be its best performance this year.

The pound, which is up against most major currencies, has been lifted by expectations that interest rates could be cut as late as December.

Traders have drastically reduced bets that the Bank of England could begin cutting interest rates over the summer after inflation figures came in higher than expected in April.

Before the inflation data, which showed prices rose at a rate of 2.3pc in April, a first cut had been given a 50pc chance of happening in June and was priced in by August at the latest.

Kabosu became recognisable as the face of Dogecoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that began as a satirical critique of the 2013 crypto frenzy.

But the token jumped in value after Tesla boss Elon Musk, a proponent of cryptocurrencies, began tweeting about it in 2020. Since then the billionaire has repeatedly promoted the coin.

Dogecoin added as much as $4bn (£3.1bn) to its market value last year when the billionaire, who bought social media site Twitter in 2022, briefly replaced Twitter's blue bird logo with an image of Kabosu. Musk subsequently renamed Twitter as X.

With a market capitalisation of around $23.6bn, Dogecoin is now the ninth biggest cryptocurrency, according to data site Coingecko.com.

""The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable,"" Dogecoin posted on social media site X on Friday.

TotalEnergies boss rejects activist demands with case for new oil fields

The boss of TotalEnergies told shareholders Friday the energy giant needed to develop new oil fields to meet global demand, as the French company's AGM was picketed by climate activists.

Patrick Pouyanne warned that higher oil prices prompted by insufficient fossil fuel output ""would quickly become unbearable for the populations in emerging countries, but also in our developed countries"".

Demand for oil was growing in line with the global population, he said.

But Mr Pouyanne also promised that TotalEnergies would pursue its ""balanced strategy"" of developing both fossil fuel and low-carbon energy production.

TotalEnergies had provided proof that it was possible ""to be a profitable, or even the most profitable, company while pursuing a transformation"" towards cleaner energy, he said.

Climate activists had gathered hours before the general meeting opened, with Greenpeace members unfurling a ""Wanted"" banner depicting Pouyanne and calling him ""the leader of France's most polluting company"".

Climate activists say TotalEnergies is contributing to global warming, to the destruction of biodiversity and to violations of human rights through its gas and oil activities.

US stock markets rise despite worries about interest rates

European and Asian stock markets have fallen today following Wall Street losses on Thursday as better-than-expected US data compounded worries that the US Federal Reserve will hold off on cutting interest rates this year.

US stocks opened higher this afternoon.

Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at City Index, said that traders ""were happy to book a profit"" on tech stocks on Thursday, with many ""likely to have taken Friday off"" ahead of Monday's Memorial Day holiday. The technology sector was boosted by strong results at US tech giant Nividia, which propelled the company's shared more than 10pc in early trading yesterday.

European and US indexes have rallied to new records in recent days thanks to solid first quarter earnings by companies and their positive outlook despite the fact it is looking increasingly unlikely the Fed will begin cutting interest rates this year.

Joshua Mahony, an analyst at Scope Markets, said:

Other data showing the US economy is coping with high interest rates, thus reducing any pressure on the Fed to cut them, has also been denting confidence in a quick reduction in borrowing costs.

Today it was US durable goods orders for April, which rose 0.4 percent month-on-month excluding the volatile transportation sector.

That followed data yesterday showing that services sector showed activity rose at its fastest pace in a year, while the factory sector also beat forecasts.

The data indicates the world's top economy remained resilient, quelling the excitement sparked by last week's news that the consumer price index slowed in April after three months of topping forecasts.

At this point, I will wish you well as you head towards the bank holiday weekend and leave you in the hands of Alex Singleton.

A quick look at the markets before a sign off shows the FTSE 100 is down 0.2pc, while the domestically-focused FTSE 250 is now up 0.5pc.

Wall Street has swung higher but European stocks fell as investors fret over data suggesting the US Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for longer.

The pound is up 0.2pc on the dollar today to $1.273, leaving it up 1.8pc so far this month.

Brent crude oil is now up 0.6pc today towards $82 a barrel.

Biden borrowing at 'unsustainable levels,' warns Fed official

The Biden administration is borrowing at ""unsustainable"" levels, a Federal Reserve governor has warned, risking higher interest rates.

Christopher Waller warned that any change in the demand for Treasury bonds could have an impact borrowing costs.

Speaking at the Reykjavik Economic Conference in Iceland, he said the US ""is on an unsustainable fiscal path"".

He warned that there would be ""upward pressure"" on interest rates ""if the growth in the supply of US Treasuries begins to outstrip demand,"" as it would mean ""lower prices and higher yields"".

It comes after President Joe Biden cancelled more than 160,000 student loans, bringing the total amount of debt forgiveness under his administration to $167bn (£131.3bn).

Safety warnings from Boeing staff jump sixfold since mid-air blowout

The number of safety concerns raised by Boeing staff increased six fold in the wake of the mid-air blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight.

The planemaker said in its annual safety report that submissions had increased dramatically in the two months following the incident on January 5.

It comes as almost $9bn (£7.1bn) was wiped off the value of Boeing after it warned it will burn through cash this year and grapple with further delays to deliveries of its new plane.

Brian West, chief financial officer, said he expected cash flow to be negative during 2024, largely owing to delayed deliveries of the 737 Max model as Boeing slows production after a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet in January.

Car maker to cut hundreds of jobs as electric vehicle demand wanes

US luxury car maker Lucid will cut about 400 jobs in the coming months amid waning demand for electric vehicles.

The reduction of about 6pc of its global workforce will cost between $21m and $25m (£16.5m and £19.7m).

The job cuts come as the wider electric car industry rides out a slowdown in sales.

Tesla announced last month it would cut 10pc of its workforce, while smaller rival Rivian has announced several rounds of layoffs.

Car manufacturers are expected to fall short of the government's target for electric vehicle (EV) sales this year, with approximately 19.8pc of the new car market predicted to be battery-electric, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

European industry figures earlier this week showed that Tesla's sales in the UK and Europe had fallen by 8pc in the first four months of the year.

Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates until September, says Goldman Sachs

The US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September, Goldman Sachs has said, pushing back its previous prediction.

The Wall Street titan had expected borrowing costs in the US to be reduced in July but its outlook has been altered by strong economic data.

Economist Jan Hatzius said: ""Earlier this week, we noted that comments from Fed officials suggested that a July cut would likely require not just better inflation numbers but also meaningful signs of softness in the activity or labour market data.""

Goldman Sachs had been one of the last banks on Wall Street betting the Fed would start lowering interest rates in July.

Eurozone interest rates on track to be cut in June, says German policymaker

The European Central Bank is on track to cut interest rates from their record highs at its next meeting, the head of the Bundesbank has said.

Interest rates in the single currency bloc have stood at 4pc since September last year but traders are betting there is a 91pc chance that this will be reduced in June as inflation in the bloc stands at 2.2pc.

Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel appeared optimistic of a cut as he spoke on the sidelines of the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Stresa, Italy.

He said: ""If the situation stays as it is now and the projections don't say something completely different -- but I don't assume that -- then the probability increases that we will see the first interest-rate step.""

He added that even if rates are cut ""it's important to me that this decision is made in such a way that no autopilot can be derived from it.""

US stocks are on track to rise at the opening bell despite data showing signs of persistent inflation.

After riding high on Nvidia's blowout revenue forecast, Wall Street's main indexes turned lower on Thursday after strong economic data meant traders reduced bets of interest rate cuts this year.

The blue-chip Dow logged its biggest one-day drop since March 2023 on Thursday while the benchmark S&P 500 recorded its worst session in over three weeks. Both the indexes were set for weekly losses after four straight weeks of gains.

Investor focus today will be on more economic data, including durable goods for April and the University of Michigan's final consumer sentiment, along with remarks from Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2pc, the S&P 500 was up 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 had gained 0.2pc.

Pharmaceutical giant GSK has won a potentially expensive personal injury case in the US over its heartburn medicine Zantac.

Angela Valadez, an 89-year-old woman living in the state of Illinois, claimed that prolonged use of Zantac caused her to develop colon cancer.

But a jury on Thursday determined that the medication was not responsible, and the judge rejected her request for $640m (£503m) in damages.

The decision is the latest in a long-running saga surrounding Zantac, which is the brand name for the drug ranitidine.

The product reduces the amount of acid the stomach makes, and was used to treat indigestion, heartburn and acid reflux.

Zantac was a best-seller in both the UK and US after its approval in the early 1980s but in 2019 a laboratory in Connecticut reported that it had found ""extremely high levels"" of NDMA when it heated ranitidine.

NDMA is a substance found in cigarettes and processed foods, and is thought to increase the risk of developing cancer.

The drug was discontinued in the UK and the US as a precaution the next year.

Oil prices have fallen after Opec+ cartel of oil producing nations pushed back the date of its next meeting, where it is due to discuss supply cuts.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, was down 0.6pc to below $81 - its weakest since February - while US-produced West Texas Intermediate fell towards $76.

Brent reached a 2024 peak of $91.17 early last month.

It comes as the Opec+ group pushed back its output policy meeting by a day to June 2 and will convene online, rather than in Vienna.

Opec+ oil producers are making voluntary output cuts totalling about 2.2m barrels per day (bpd) for the first half of 2024, led by Saudi Arabia rolling over an earlier voluntary cut.

It comes against a backdrop of rising output from the United States and other non-member producers, while worries over demand have remained in focus as major economies grapple with high interest rates.

Sources from countries that have made voluntary supply cuts told Reuters this month that an extension was likely.

Pictured: 'Wanted' poster of TotalEnergies boss unfurled by climate activists

Five Greenpeace activists have climbed up a building near TotalEnergies' Paris headquarters and unfurled a banner criticising the oil giant's climate change strategy as it holds is annual shareholder meeting.

The climate group opposes Total's continued exploration of oil and gas, despite a ""climate emergency"", a Greenpeace spokesman said.

The banner included a large photo of Total chief executive and chairman Patrick Pouyanne under a 'Wanted' heading.

Barriers had already been erected around the entrances of Total's offices in Paris' La Defense district on Thursday evening, with employees told to work from home on Friday.

Total shareholders are due to vote later on whether to approve the progress Total has made on its sustainability and climate goals for 2030.

Activists and climate-focused investors have ramped up pressure on the world's leading oil and gas companies in recent years, frequently derailing shareholder meetings.

The pound was steady after data showed wet weather hit consumer spending far more than expected in April.

Sterling was last flat against the dollar at $1.27, having traded as high as $1.276 after Wednesday's data showed inflation eased to 2.3pc in April, above forecasts if a drop to 2.1pc.

Sterling has been strengthened after traders reduced bets on of a June rate cut by the Bank of England to below 10pc, from around 50pc before Wednesday's inflation data.

Today, the Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes dropped by 2.3pc in April after a 0.2pc fall in March, which was far worse than a predicted fall of 0.5pc.

He claimed previous governments had gone ""round and round in circles"" with short-term solutions. Sir Keir added:

Gas prices are on track for their largest weekly gain in a month amid concerns about supplies from Norway and Russia.

Dutch front-month futures, the benchmark contract on the continent, has risen as much as 1.3pc and was on track for an increase of more than 10pc this week.

The UK equivalent was up more than 13pc on the week.

It comes after an unplanned outage at a major plant in Norway, which is the largest supplier to Europe.

Meanwhile, Austrian supplier OMV has warned of a risk to flows from Russia after a court ruling this week banning payments to Kremlin-backed producer Gazprom.

It comes as prices are also rising in Asia as a heatwave increases demand for air conditioning, pushing up global competition for liquified natural gas.

UK stocks fell nearly 1pc in early trading as investors were unnerved by weak retail sales and robust US economic data that fuelled worries that interest rates will stay high for longer.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index dipped as much as 0.9pc and was poised for a fourth consecutive session in the red, which is its longest losing streak in more than three months. The index was set to log a second consecutive week of declines.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped 0.4pc and was also on track for a fourth straight day of losses.

It comes as retail sales in the UK fell by 2.3pc - much more than the 0.5pc expected.

Meanwhile, robust economic data from the US showed business activity in May accelerated to the highest level in over two years.

Investors took some profits following a near 8pc climb in London stocks over the past five weeks.

Among stocks, AJ Bell fell 4.5pc to the bottom of the FTSE 250 after the investment platform's founder sold 7.5m shares in the company.

National Grid slumped 10.3pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after a nearly 11pc drop on Thursday when it announced plans to sell more shares.

Retailers need to target consumers of all budgets, say analysts

After the sharp fall in retail sales last month, Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail at Deloitte, said:

The FTSE 100 dropped as trading began after figures showing retail sales fell much more than expected last month.

The UK's blue chip stock index was down 0.8pc to 8,272.84 while the midcap FTSE 250 fell 0.3pc to 20,579.35.

Retail sales fell by 2.3pc between March and April amid poor weather, which was far more than the 0.5pc drop predicted by analysts.

The boss of Abrdn will step down after four years in charge in which he dropped the vowels from the company's name in a controversial rebrand.

Stephen Bird will leave after a turbulent period during which the asset manager was ejected from the premier FTSE 100 index after its shares plunged, launching plans this year to axe £150m in costs.

A statement to shareholders said: ""Following the significant strategic repositioning of the company, the board and group CEO, Stephen Bird, have together agreed that it is the right time for Stephen to hand over the reins to the team he has assembled over the last four years to drive the business forward.""

The asset manager's chief financial officer Jason Windsor will become interim chief executive, with Mr Bird stepping down at the end of June.

Under Mr Bird's tenure, Abrdn was forced to defend its decision to drop most of the vowels from its name following claims that the brand makeover has made it a victim of ""corporate bullying"".

Critics have joked that the company developed a case of ""irritable vowel syndrome"" and have referred to Stephen Bird, the company's chief executive, as Stphn Brd.

Consumer spending to recover this year, economists insist

Retail sales fell by more than expected during a washout April, official figures show, but economists think the outlook for the sector is ""bright"".

Sales volumes fell by 2.3pc last month, far more than the 0.5pc decline that had been predicted by analysts.

However, separate data showed consumer confidence has continued its ""upward momentum"" despite the cost-of-living crisis remaining a daily reality for households.

GfK's long-running consumer confidence index rose by two points in May to minus 17.

Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that ""as inflation falls further this year, rising real household disposable income should boost retail activity throughout the rest of 2024"". He added:

A North Sea engineering group has rejected a fresh £1.5bn bid from a Dubai-based rival, as low valuations on the London Stock Exchange prompt a wave of foreign takeover attempts.

John Wood Group has rejected a third offer of 220p per share from Sidara, up from previous offers of 212p and 205p earlier this month.

It said the new bid ""continued to significantly undervalue the group and its prospects"".

The Aberdeen-based company is a global player in oil, gas, renewable energy and in the production of minerals such as lithium, which are seen as critical for reaching net zero. It employs around 35,000 people in 60 countries.

Shares are still up 10pc since the first takeover offer was first disclosed on May 8.

Falling bills offer small comfort to struggling households, say Citizens Advice

As the latest Ofgem price cap indicated household bills will fall by 7pc from July, Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty said:

Retail sales fell in Britain last month, official figures show, in a blow to the Prime Minister as he argues the economy has ""turned a corner"".

Sales volumes fell across most sectors, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a decline by 0.2pc in March.

Clothing retailers, sports equipment, games and toys stores, and furniture stores were particularly hit by poor weather, which reduced footfall.

Household energy bills will be 7pc lower on average from July compared to the previous three months in England, Scotland and Wales, after Ofgem announced its latest price cap.

The price cap ""assumes"" a standing charge - the flat amount all households pay to have energy delivered to their homes - of £334 for a dual fuel customer and £369 for those who pay by standard credit, unchanged from the last price cap.

Energy bills to drop by £122 a year as Tories vow more support for households

Household energy bills will fall by £122 a year as Rishi Sunak pledges to make it easier for customers to get the best deal in his election campaign.

The Ofgem price cap will fall from £1,690 per year to £1,568 from July 1, leaving energy bills at their lowest level since before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine triggered an energy shock for European economies.

The price cap had been set at £1,216 a year over the winter of 2021 to 2022, before the war sent energy costs rocketing, with the Government forced to intervene to limit bills to £2,500 a year during the peak of the fuel crisis.

It comes as the Prime Minister seeks to put falling energy bills at the centre of the election campaign.

The Tories will vow to make price comparison websites easier to use and consider telling the regulator Ofgem to publish league tables showing how long energy firms take to respond to customer complaints.

Thanks for joining me. We begin the day with the announcement of an impending fall in energy bills.

The Ofgem price cap will fall by £122 to £1,568 from July 1, meaning the average household electricity and gas bills will be at their lowest level since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

What happened overnight

Asian stocks fell as strong US economic data bolstered the prospect of interest rates staying higher for longer and the Federal Reserve taking its time in cutting rates.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1pc and was on course for a 1.5pc weekly decline, snapping its four-week winning streak. Japan's Nikkei fell 1pc.

In America, the S&P 500 slid 0.7pc to 5,267.84, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading US companies finished down 1.5pc at 39,065.26. Meanwhile, the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4pc to 16,736.03.

US Treasury yields turned higher after data suggested American business activity has picked up and the labor market remains tight, supporting the Fed's ""higher for longer"" interest rate narrative. The benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds reached a yield of 4.4787pc, from 4.434pc late on Wednesday.

Tokyo stocks opened lower on Friday, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index tumbling 1.50pc to 38,518.54 in early trade, while the broader Topix index slipped 1.28pc to 2,719.49.

Sterling is up 1.8pc against the dollar so far this month to trade at more than $1.27, which would be its best performance this year.

The pound, which is up against most major currencies, has been lifted by expectations that interest rates could be cut as late as December.

Traders have drastically reduced bets that the Bank of England could begin cutting interest rates over the summer after inflation figures came in higher than expected in April.

Before the inflation data, which showed prices rose at a rate of 2.3pc in April, a first cut had been given a 50pc chance of happening in June and was priced in by August at the latest.

Thanks for joining us today. We'll be back on Tuesday to cover the latest from the markets, after the bank holiday. In the meantime, I'll leave you with the news that Kabosu, a Japanese dog who became an internet sensation, has died at 18.

Kabosu became recognisable as the face of Dogecoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that began as a satirical critique of the 2013 crypto frenzy.

But the token jumped in value after Tesla boss Elon Musk, a proponent of cryptocurrencies, began tweeting about it in 2020. Since then the billionaire has repeatedly promoted the coin.

Dogecoin added as much as $4bn (£3.1bn) to its market value last year when the billionaire, who bought social media site Twitter in 2022, briefly replaced Twitter's blue bird logo with an image of Kabosu. Musk subsequently renamed Twitter as X.

With a market capitalisation of around $23.6bn, Dogecoin is now the ninth biggest cryptocurrency, according to data site Coingecko.com.

""The impact this one dog has made across the world is immeasurable,"" Dogecoin posted on social media site X on Friday.

The FTSE 100 fell 0.2pc today. The biggest riser in the index was Ocado, up 6.2pc, followed by Marks & Spencer, up 2.3pc. The biggest faller was National Grid, down 11.5pc, followed by components supplier RS Group, down 2.6pc.

However, the FTSE 250 closed up 0.7pc. The top riser was mining company Ferrexpo, up 5.8pc, followed by engineering business John Wood, up 5.2pc. Essentra, a components supplier, was the biggest faller, down 4.9pc, followed by AJ Bell, down 4.6pc.

The boss of TotalEnergies told shareholders Friday the energy giant needed to develop new oil fields to meet global demand, as the French company's AGM was picketed by climate activists.

Patrick Pouyanne warned that higher oil prices prompted by insufficient fossil fuel output ""would quickly become unbearable for the populations in emerging countries, but also in our developed countries"".

Demand for oil was growing in line with the global population, he said.

But Mr Pouyanne also promised that TotalEnergies would pursue its ""balanced strategy"" of developing both fossil fuel and low-carbon energy production.

TotalEnergies had provided proof that it was possible ""to be a profitable, or even the most profitable, company while pursuing a transformation"" towards cleaner energy, he said.

Climate activists had gathered hours before the general meeting opened, with Greenpeace members unfurling a ""Wanted"" banner depicting Pouyanne and calling him ""the leader of France's most polluting company"".

Climate activists say TotalEnergies is contributing to global warming, to the destruction of biodiversity and to violations of human rights through its gas and oil activities.

The president of the Bundesbank said today that an interest rate cut is becoming more likely.

Joachim Nagel, who is an ECB governing council member, told Bloomberg Television:

But he said that people should not assume at a June cut would mean there would automatically be one in July. He said:

European and Asian stock markets have fallen today following Wall Street losses on Thursday as better-than-expected US data compounded worries that the US Federal Reserve will hold off on cutting interest rates this year.

US stocks opened higher this afternoon.

Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at City Index, said that traders ""were happy to book a profit"" on tech stocks on Thursday, with many ""likely to have taken Friday off"" ahead of Monday's Memorial Day holiday. The technology sector was boosted by strong results at US tech giant Nividia, which propelled the company's shared more than 10pc in early trading yesterday.

European and US indexes have rallied to new records in recent days thanks to solid first quarter earnings by companies and their positive outlook despite the fact it is looking increasingly unlikely the Fed will begin cutting interest rates this year.

Joshua Mahony, an analyst at Scope Markets, said:

Other data showing the US economy is coping with high interest rates, thus reducing any pressure on the Fed to cut them, has also been denting confidence in a quick reduction in borrowing costs.

Today it was US durable goods orders for April, which rose 0.4 percent month-on-month excluding the volatile transportation sector.

That followed data yesterday showing that services sector showed activity rose at its fastest pace in a year, while the factory sector also beat forecasts.

The data indicates the world's top economy remained resilient, quelling the excitement sparked by last week's news that the consumer price index slowed in April after three months of topping forecasts.

At this point, I will wish you well as you head towards the bank holiday weekend and leave you in the hands of Alex Singleton.

A quick look at the markets before a sign off shows the FTSE 100 is down 0.2pc, while the domestically-focused FTSE 250 is now up 0.5pc.

Wall Street has swung higher but European stocks fell as investors fret over data suggesting the US Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for longer.

The pound is up 0.2pc on the dollar today to $1.273, leaving it up 1.8pc so far this month.

Brent crude oil is now up 0.6pc today towards $82 a barrel.

Security guards resorted to spraying climate activists with a hose as shareholder meetings of TotalEnergies and one of its major investors descended into chaos.

Consumers expect inflation to rise at a slightly quicker pace over the next year compared to their outlook last month, according to a closely-watched survey.

The latest data from the University of Michigan shows consumers think there will be 3.3pc of inflation over the next year, compared to 3.2pc expected in April.

The Biden administration is borrowing at ""unsustainable"" levels, a Federal Reserve governor has warned, risking higher interest rates.

Christopher Waller warned that any change in the demand for Treasury bonds could have an impact borrowing costs.

Speaking at the Reykjavik Economic Conference in Iceland, he said the US ""is on an unsustainable fiscal path"".

He warned that there would be ""upward pressure"" on interest rates ""if the growth in the supply of US Treasuries begins to outstrip demand,"" as it would mean ""lower prices and higher yields"".

It comes after President Joe Biden cancelled more than 160,000 student loans, bringing the total amount of debt forgiveness under his administration to $167bn (£131.3bn).

The main US stock indexes opened higher despite signs of persistent inflation that rekindled caution.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 23.97 points, or 0.1pc, at the open to 39,089.23.

The S&P 500 opened higher by 13.61 points, or 0.3pc, at 5,281.45, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 50.76 points, or 0.3pc, to 16,786.79 at the opening bell.

The number of safety concerns raised by Boeing staff increased six fold in the wake of the mid-air blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight.

The planemaker said in its annual safety report that submissions had increased dramatically in the two months following the incident on January 5.

It comes as almost $9bn (£7.1bn) was wiped off the value of Boeing after it warned it will burn through cash this year and grapple with further delays to deliveries of its new plane.

Brian West, chief financial officer, said he expected cash flow to be negative during 2024, largely owing to delayed deliveries of the 737 Max model as Boeing slows production after a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet in January.

US luxury car maker Lucid will cut about 400 jobs in the coming months amid waning demand for electric vehicles.

The reduction of about 6pc of its global workforce will cost between $21m and $25m (£16.5m and £19.7m).

The job cuts come as the wider electric car industry rides out a slowdown in sales.

Tesla announced last month it would cut 10pc of its workforce, while smaller rival Rivian has announced several rounds of layoffs.

Car manufacturers are expected to fall short of the government's target for electric vehicle (EV) sales this year, with approximately 19.8pc of the new car market predicted to be battery-electric, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

European industry figures earlier this week showed that Tesla's sales in the UK and Europe had fallen by 8pc in the first four months of the year.

The pound is on track for its best month since November as the timing of interest rate cuts has been pushed back until after the election.

Sterling is up 1.6pc against the dollar so far this month, which would be its best performance this year.

The pound, which is up against most major currencies, has been lifted by expectations that interest rates could be cut as late as November.

Traders drastically reduced bets that the Bank of England could begin cutting interest rates as early as June after inflation figures came in higher than expected in April.

The Co-operative Bank is set to return to mutual status after more than a decade following a £780m takeover by the Coventry Building Society.

The US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September, Goldman Sachs has said, pushing back its previous prediction.

The Wall Street titan had expected borrowing costs in the US to be reduced in July but its outlook has been altered by strong economic data.

Economist Jan Hatzius said: ""Earlier this week, we noted that comments from Fed officials suggested that a July cut would likely require not just better inflation numbers but also meaningful signs of softness in the activity or labour market data.""

Goldman Sachs had been one of the last banks on Wall Street betting the Fed would start lowering interest rates in July.

Earlier this week, Nomura Securities also pushed its prediction from July to September, saying ""the threshold for rate cuts appears to have risen"".

Thames Water shareholders will have to wait longer to see if their plans to increase bills by 45pc will be approved by regulators.

Ofwat has delayed its review of the prices that will be sought by water companies until after the general election.

The regulator will not reveal its determinations until July 11, pushing it back from June 12.

Ministers have rushed through tough new laws on foreign investment in the media without exceptions that proprietors including Rupert Murdoch had sought, leaving the industry in limbo.

The European Central Bank is on track to cut interest rates from their record highs at its next meeting, the head of the Bundesbank has said.

Interest rates in the single currency bloc have stood at 4pc since September last year but traders are betting there is a 91pc chance that this will be reduced in June as inflation in the bloc stands at 2.2pc.

Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel appeared optimistic of a cut as he spoke on the sidelines of the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Stresa, Italy.

He said: ""If the situation stays as it is now and the projections don't say something completely different -- but I don't assume that -- then the probability increases that we will see the first interest-rate step.""

He added that even if rates are cut ""it's important to me that this decision is made in such a way that no autopilot can be derived from it.""

US stocks are on track to rise at the opening bell despite data showing signs of persistent inflation.

After riding high on Nvidia's blowout revenue forecast, Wall Street's main indexes turned lower on Thursday after strong economic data meant traders reduced bets of interest rate cuts this year.

The blue-chip Dow logged its biggest one-day drop since March 2023 on Thursday while the benchmark S&P 500 recorded its worst session in over three weeks. Both the indexes were set for weekly losses after four straight weeks of gains.

Investor focus today will be on more economic data, including durable goods for April and the University of Michigan's final consumer sentiment, along with remarks from Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2pc, the S&P 500 was up 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 had gained 0.2pc.

Pharmaceutical giant GSK has won a potentially expensive personal injury case in the US over its heartburn medicine Zantac.

Angela Valadez, an 89-year-old woman living in the state of Illinois, claimed that prolonged use of Zantac caused her to develop colon cancer.

But a jury on Thursday determined that the medication was not responsible, and the judge rejected her request for $640m (£503m) in damages.

The decision is the latest in a long-running saga surrounding Zantac, which is the brand name for the drug ranitidine.

The product reduces the amount of acid the stomach makes, and was used to treat indigestion, heartburn and acid reflux.

Zantac was a best-seller in both the UK and US after its approval in the early 1980s but in 2019 a laboratory in Connecticut reported that it had found ""extremely high levels"" of NDMA when it heated ranitidine.

NDMA is a substance found in cigarettes and processed foods, and is thought to increase the risk of developing cancer.

The drug was discontinued in the UK and the US as a precaution the next year.

Oil prices have fallen after Opec+ cartel of oil producing nations pushed back the date of its next meeting, where it is due to discuss supply cuts.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, was down 0.6pc to below $81 - its weakest since February - while US-produced West Texas Intermediate fell towards $76.

Brent reached a 2024 peak of $91.17 early last month.

It comes as the Opec+ group pushed back its output policy meeting by a day to June 2 and will convene online, rather than in Vienna.

Opec+ oil producers are making voluntary output cuts totalling about 2.2m barrels per day (bpd) for the first half of 2024, led by Saudi Arabia rolling over an earlier voluntary cut.

It comes against a backdrop of rising output from the United States and other non-member producers, while worries over demand have remained in focus as major economies grapple with high interest rates.

Sources from countries that have made voluntary supply cuts told Reuters this month that an extension was likely.

Google's artificial intelligence-powered search results have claimed that Barack Obama is a Muslim and told people to eat rocks, in the latest high-profile case of the company's AI systems misfiring.

Sir Keir Starmer has said his proposed GB Energy - a new, publicly-owned clean energy company - would bring down energy bills ""for good"".

He said a Labour government would also make sure renewables jobs stay in the UK.

Ahead of a campaign event in Glasgow later, he told Sky News:

The Labour leader continued: ""The wind farms that were put up on the hills just a few miles from here were all towed in from other countries.

""We didn't get the jobs that went with them. I'm determined to turn that around.""

Five Greenpeace activists have climbed up a building near TotalEnergies' Paris headquarters and unfurled a banner criticising the oil giant's climate change strategy as it holds is annual shareholder meeting.

The climate group opposes Total's continued exploration of oil and gas, despite a ""climate emergency"", a Greenpeace spokesman said.

The banner included a large photo of Total chief executive and chairman Patrick Pouyanne under a 'Wanted' heading.

Barriers had already been erected around the entrances of Total's offices in Paris' La Defense district on Thursday evening, with employees told to work from home on Friday.

Total shareholders are due to vote later on whether to approve the progress Total has made on its sustainability and climate goals for 2030.

Activists and climate-focused investors have ramped up pressure on the world's leading oil and gas companies in recent years, frequently derailing shareholder meetings.

Earlier this week climate activists disrupted Shell's annual shareholder meeting, chanting: ""Shell kills.""

The pound was steady after data showed wet weather hit consumer spending far more than expected in April.

Sterling was last flat against the dollar at $1.27, having traded as high as $1.276 after Wednesday's data showed inflation eased to 2.3pc in April, above forecasts if a drop to 2.1pc.

Sterling has been strengthened after traders reduced bets on of a June rate cut by the Bank of England to below 10pc, from around 50pc before Wednesday's inflation data.

Today, the Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes dropped by 2.3pc in April after a 0.2pc fall in March, which was far worse than a predicted fall of 0.5pc.

The pound was little changed against the euro, which is worth 85p.

Sir Keir Starmer did not accept claims he would have to raise taxes, make spending cuts or change Labour's fiscal rules if his party wins power.

The Labour leader said he did not agree with the findings of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme:

He claimed previous governments had gone ""round and round in circles"" with short-term solutions. Sir Keir added:

Gas prices are on track for their largest weekly gain in a month amid concerns about supplies from Norway and Russia.

Dutch front-month futures, the benchmark contract on the continent, has risen as much as 1.3pc and was on track for an increase of more than 10pc this week.

The UK equivalent was up more than 13pc on the week.

It comes after an unplanned outage at a major plant in Norway, which is the largest supplier to Europe.

Meanwhile, Austrian supplier OMV has warned of a risk to flows from Russia after a court ruling this week banning payments to Kremlin-backed producer Gazprom.

It comes as prices are also rising in Asia as a heatwave increases demand for air conditioning, pushing up global competition for liquified natural gas.

UK stocks fell nearly 1pc in early trading as investors were unnerved by weak retail sales and robust US economic data that fuelled worries that interest rates will stay high for longer.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index dipped as much as 0.9pc and was poised for a fourth consecutive session in the red, which is its longest losing streak in more than three months. The index was set to log a second consecutive week of declines.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped 0.4pc and was also on track for a fourth straight day of losses.

It comes as retail sales in the UK fell by 2.3pc - much more than the 0.5pc expected.

Meanwhile, robust economic data from the US showed business activity in May accelerated to the highest level in over two years.

Investors took some profits following a near 8pc climb in London stocks over the past five weeks.

Among stocks, AJ Bell fell 4.5pc to the bottom of the FTSE 250 after the investment platform's founder sold 7.5m shares in the company.

National Grid slumped 10.3pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after a nearly 11pc drop on Thursday when it announced plans to sell more shares.

Intertek Group was up 2.9pc to lead the FTSE 100 after the product testing firm reconfirmed its forecast for 2024.

After the sharp fall in retail sales last month, Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail at Deloitte, said:

The FTSE 100 dropped as trading began after figures showing retail sales fell much more than expected last month.

The UK's blue chip stock index was down 0.8pc to 8,272.84 while the midcap FTSE 250 fell 0.3pc to 20,579.35.

Retail sales fell by 2.3pc between March and April amid poor weather, which was far more than the 0.5pc drop predicted by analysts.

The boss of Abrdn will step down after four years in charge in which he dropped the vowels from the company's name in a controversial rebrand.

Stephen Bird will leave after a turbulent period during which the asset manager was ejected from the premier FTSE 100 index after its shares plunged, launching plans this year to axe £150m in costs.

A statement to shareholders said: ""Following the significant strategic repositioning of the company, the board and group CEO, Stephen Bird, have together agreed that it is the right time for Stephen to hand over the reins to the team he has assembled over the last four years to drive the business forward.""

The asset manager's chief financial officer Jason Windsor will become interim chief executive, with Mr Bird stepping down at the end of June.

Under Mr Bird's tenure, Abrdn was forced to defend its decision to drop most of the vowels from its name following claims that the brand makeover has made it a victim of ""corporate bullying"".

Critics have joked that the company developed a case of ""irritable vowel syndrome"" and have referred to Stephen Bird, the company's chief executive, as Stphn Brd.

Chairman Sir Douglas Flint said:

Retail sales fell by more than expected during a washout April, official figures show, but economists think the outlook for the sector is ""bright"".

Sales volumes fell by 2.3pc last month, far more than the 0.5pc decline that had been predicted by analysts.

However, separate data showed consumer confidence has continued its ""upward momentum"" despite the cost-of-living crisis remaining a daily reality for households.

GfK's long-running consumer confidence index rose by two points in May to minus 17.

Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that ""as inflation falls further this year, rising real household disposable income should boost retail activity throughout the rest of 2024"". He added:

A North Sea engineering group has rejected a fresh £1.5bn bid from a Dubai-based rival, as low valuations on the London Stock Exchange prompt a wave of foreign takeover attempts.

John Wood Group has rejected a third offer of 220p per share from Sidara, up from previous offers of 212p and 205p earlier this month.

It said the new bid ""continued to significantly undervalue the group and its prospects"".

The Aberdeen-based company is a global player in oil, gas, renewable energy and in the production of minerals such as lithium, which are seen as critical for reaching net zero. It employs around 35,000 people in 60 countries.

Shares are still up 10pc since the first takeover offer was first disclosed on May 8.

As the latest Ofgem price cap indicated household bills will fall by 7pc from July, Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty said:

Retail sales fell in Britain last month, official figures show, in a blow to the Prime Minister as he argues the economy has ""turned a corner"".

Sales volumes fell across most sectors, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a decline by 0.2pc in March.

Clothing retailers, sports equipment, games and toys stores, and furniture stores were particularly hit by poor weather, which reduced footfall.

Household energy bills will be 7pc lower on average from July compared to the previous three months in England, Scotland and Wales, after Ofgem announced its latest price cap.

The price cap ""assumes"" a standing charge - the flat amount all households pay to have energy delivered to their homes - of £334 for a dual fuel customer and £369 for those who pay by standard credit, unchanged from the last price cap.

Household energy bills will fall by £122 a year as Rishi Sunak pledges to make it easier for customers to get the best deal in his election campaign.

The Ofgem price cap will fall from £1,690 per year to £1,568 from July 1, leaving energy bills at their lowest level since before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine triggered an energy shock for European economies.

The price cap had been set at £1,216 a year over the winter of 2021 to 2022, before the war sent energy costs rocketing, with the Government forced to intervene to limit bills to £2,500 a year during the peak of the fuel crisis.

It comes as the Prime Minister seeks to put falling energy bills at the centre of the election campaign.

The Tories will vow to make price comparison websites easier to use and consider telling the regulator Ofgem to publish league tables showing how long energy firms take to respond to customer complaints.

Thanks for joining me. We begin the day with the announcement of an impending fall in energy bills.

The Ofgem price cap will fall by £122 to £1,568 from July 1, meaning the average household electricity and gas bills will be at their lowest level since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Asian stocks fell as strong US economic data bolstered the prospect of interest rates staying higher for longer and the Federal Reserve taking its time in cutting rates.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1pc and was on course for a 1.5pc weekly decline, snapping its four-week winning streak. Japan's Nikkei fell 1pc.

In America, the S&P 500 slid 0.7pc to 5,267.84, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading US companies finished down 1.5pc at 39,065.26. Meanwhile, the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4pc to 16,736.03.

US Treasury yields turned higher after data suggested American business activity has picked up and the labor market remains tight, supporting the Fed's ""higher for longer"" interest rate narrative. The benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds reached a yield of 4.4787pc, from 4.434pc late on Wednesday.

The average LNG price for July delivery into north-east Asia LNG-AS rose to $12.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), its highest level since mid-December and up from $10.90/mmBtu in the previous week, industry sources estimated.

""Spot LNG prices remain strong, supported by firm demand, unexpected outages and ongoing geopolitical risks,"" said Alex Froley, senior LNG analyst at data intelligence firm ICIS.

""Asian buyers have been increasing demand to take advantage of this year's lower prices relative to last year, with countries including China and Thailand seeing record import levels,"" he said.

Hot weather across some of the Asia region's markets has lifted power demand, supporting purchasing activity, said Samuel Good, head of LNG pricing at commodity pricing agency Argus, adding that temperatures in eastern China are forecast to remain above seasonal norms, supporting power gas burn.

In south-east Asia, some buyers recently issued tenders for longer-term cargoes, according to Charles Costerousse, senior LNG analyst at data analytics firm Kpler.

""The Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China (JKTC) region and India have in total received 14.06 million metric tons (mt) of LNG so far for May this year, compared to 17.07 mt for May last year,"" he said.

In Europe, gas market gains have tightened discounts to the Asian market substantially, amid maintenance outages in Norway and concerns over Russian pipeline supply after Austria's OMV OMVV.VI said that gas supplies from Russia's Gazprom GAZP.MM could be suspended in connection with a foreign court ruling.

""The market has to factor in the possibility of heightened geopolitical risks. In particular, the possibility of disruption to either Russian pipeline or LNG exports, or both. Austria's OMV said it could lose pipe supply from Russia. Europe, meanwhile, is considering restrictions on Russian LNG,"" ICIS' Froley said.

S&P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily North West Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in June on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $11.118/mmBtu on May 23, a $0.20/mmBtu discount to the July gas price at the Dutch TTF hub.

Argus assessed the July delivery price at $11.150/mmBtu, while Spark Commodities assessed the June delivery price at $11.003/mmBtu.

In the United States, Argus' Good said Freeport LNG production has held strong in recent days at levels that would suggest all three trains are operating near to capacity. Production at other U.S. terminals has also been largely steady.

LNG freight rates in the Atlantic saw the highest week-on-week increase this year and hit the highest level since the end of March at $48,250/day on Friday. The Pacific rates fell to $44,500/day, said Spark Commodities analyst Qasim Afghan.

In a statement late on Thursday, CEZ said the ICC Tribunal granted a request confirming that disputes between the companies should be resolved in ICC arbitration, not in Russian courts.

In February 2023, CEZ sought compensation of around 1 billion crowns ($44 million) from Gazprom due to lower-than-contracted gas supplies in 2022, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The Kremlin-controlled energy giant Gazprom last month filed lawsuits against CEZ and others as it aimed to move court cases to Russia from international arbitration.

CEZ said in its statement that Gazprom was bound by an arbitration clause agreed with CEZ under which disputes related to gas supplies would be settled before the ICC. It had applied for an interim measure in this instance, which was given.

""The Tribunal granted our request, confirming that disputes between the companies should be resolved in ICC arbitration, not in front of Russian courts,"" CEZ said.

Gazprom did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

On Wednesday, a Russian court ruling banned Austrian energy company OMV Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from pursuing arbitration proceedings in Stockholm against Gazprom's exporting arm.

The court threatened to fine OMV 575.2 million euros. OMV said it considered the Russian legal proceedings to be illegitimate.

The Czech Republic was nearly completely dependent on Russian gas supplies, mostly through the Nord Stream pipeline and Germany, until 2022 when Russia reduced shipments as relations with the West deteriorated sharply. It has replaced supplies with pipeline and LNG gas from other sources.

Beginning Thursday (May 23), the TSA accepts mobile driver's licenses and identification cards in LA Wallet at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (MSY) and 26 other participating airports nationwide.

REAL ID-compliant credentials are required to use LA Wallet on TSA equipment at MSY.

Residents with LA Wallet can present their mobile driver's license or ID card at select TSA checkpoints by tapping their phone or scanning the QR code in the app. The TSA reader at the security checkpoint takes the traveler's photo.

Once the Credential Authentication Technology Reader (CAT-2) confirms the identity match, a TSA officer verifies the match, and the passenger proceeds to security screening. The traveler's photo and personal information are deleted after each transaction.

This information will not be shared with other entities and will not be used for law enforcement or surveillance.

Passengers must continue to have their physical IDs on hand. Suppose a digital ID cannot be verified at the TSA security checkpoint. In that case, a passenger must use an acceptable physical identity document (e.g., driver's license, passport) to proceed through the identity verification.

Louisiana is the eighth state to offer digital IDs with TSA CAT-2 interoperability. The other states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, and Utah.

Travelers with a state-issued mobile DL in those states can use the CAT-2 unit's reader as an alternative to providing a physical photo ID and boarding pass to the TSA officer for identity verification.

MSY is the only airport in Louisiana that utilizes CAT-2 digital ID readers.

OMV urges all residents to consider a REAL ID-compliant credential when renewing their license or identification card. LOUIE, the Louisiana OMV REAL ID virtual expert at www.expresslane.org/REALID, can help residents identify the required documents.

Louisiana residents can download the mobile driver's license app from LA Wallet at no cost from the Apple App Store or Google Play. For more information on LA Wallet, visit lawallet.com. For additional information on all digital identity solutions accepted at select TSA checkpoints, visit tsa.gov/digital-id.

At a press event, Governor Jeff Landry and New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced the new system.

""We all know anytime you can increase security and IDing at airports, you basically increase expediency.......and if you can move through quickly, that's important,"" said Governor Landry.

Mayor Cantrell added, ""When we opened, I said on that day that MSY would be a great example in the city of New Orleans of investing big in partnership with the federal government and in partnership with the state of Louisiana...of how New Orleans maintains its assets.""

The governor hopes this will expand to other Louisiana airports by the end of the year.",wafb.com,news,WAFB,,0.2,454242576,5,https://gray-wafb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/YVYGZFFPOVEAFPYLYHIKQVN5RE.jpg?auth=7fc79341999aaf87320fc83dbda54583ab44d66a10da4760e40a24c98b9597fb&width=1200&height=600&smart=true,eng-9593775

The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub was down 0.77 euro at 34.60 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) at 0807 GMT, while the September contract was down 0.52 euro at 36.20 euros/ MWh.

In the British market, the front-month price was down 1.33 pence at 84 pence per therm.

""The latest temperature forecast is mostly in line with the previous weather run, expecting temperatures to fluctuate between 0.8 degrees (Celsius) and 3.8 degrees above the seasonal norm for the next 14 days,"" LSEG analyst Tomasz Marcin Kowalski said in a daily market update.

LSEG data showed total Norwegian export nominations increased by 18 million cubic metres/day (mcm/d), to 286 mcm/d due to higher available capacity at the Kollsnes gas processing plant and Troll gas field.

Prices had risen over the past few days on fears that Russia could halt gas flows to Austria's OMV after the company said on Wednesday supplies from Gazprom may be suspended in connection with a foreign court ruling, without identifying the case.

Traders said technically the price rise had looked overdone and there could be some profit taking on Friday.

The relative strength index (RSI) of the Dutch front-month gas contract had risen above 70 on Thursday according to LSEG data, a threshold indicating that a stock or commodity may be due for an downwards correction.

The RSI had risen fallen back below 70 by Friday morning, the data showed.

""Romgaz's 'BBB-' rating benefits from a one-notch uplift from its 'bb+' Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) for state support, as per our Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement on Tuesday.

The gas producer's SCP rating reflects its dominant position on the Romanian natural gas market as well as its upstream production growth potential thanks to the Neptun Deep and Caragele reservoir developments. Romgaz also benefits from a conservative financial policy, Fitch Ratings said. However, a comparatively modest production scale, lack of geographic diversification due to its sole focus on Romania, the aging nature of its legacy gas assets, large capex and manageable execution risk represent the key risks affecting the company's rating.

Romgaz is planning a eurobond issuance worth 1.5 billion euro ($1.63 billion) in order to finance its Neptun Deep reservoir project, local news outlet ZF.ro reported last week.

In the first quarter of 2024, Romgaz boosted its net profit by an annual 94% to 1.245 billion lei ($271.4 million/250.3 million euro), it said in a financial report filed with the Bucharest Stock Exchange last week.

Romgaz shares changed hands 0.18% higher at 55.2 lei as at 1008 CET on Friday on the Bucharest bourse.

""KEY RATING DRIVERS

Large Capex Plans: Romgaz has ambitious plans to develop Neptun Deep, a deepwater offshore project in the Romanian Black Sea. Romgaz acquired a 50% stake in the project from Exxon Mobil for EUR1 billion in 2022 and is partners with OMV Petrom, Neptun Deep's operator. The development plan includes infrastructure of 10 wells and an offshore platform, with production expected to start in 2027, reaching a gross plateau production of approximately 8 billion cubic metres (bcm) annually. Romgaz and OMV Petrom will invest up to EUR4 billion in the project.

Transformational Project: We view Neptun Deep as a transformational project for Romgaz. It will allow Romgaz to increase natural gas production by half to around 150 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboe/d) from 83 kboe/d in 2023, halting a declining production trend from existing mature reservoirs. The project will also secure Romania's energy independence and position the country as the EU's largest natural gas producer from domestic resources. We view execution risk as manageable given the partner's experience in development of oil and gas projects.

Leverage to Temporarily Spike: Romgaz has historically operated with a net cash position, reflecting its prudent financial management. We forecast EBITDA net leverage will rise through 2026 due to significant capex, particularly on Neptun Deep development. However, we expect net leverage to decline from 2027 as new projects contribute to EBITDA. Romgaz's financial policy assumes EBITDA net leverage below 2.0x across economic cycles, supporting the company's 'bb+' SCP.

'Very Strong' Decision-Making and Oversight: Romanian government exercises significant control over Romgaz's decision-making, including its operational activities, financial performance, funding structure, and investment plans. This control is evident through the government's 70% ownership stake, and its oversight is robust, with Romgaz being subjected to frequent, periodic reporting on key operating and financial indicators. We therefore view the score for decision-making and oversight as 'Very Strong'.

Preservation of Government Policy Role: We assess the Preservation of Government Policy Role as 'Strong' due to Romgaz's pivotal role in energy self-sufficiency and security for Romania. Romgaz's natural gas production, ownership of Romanian gas storage network and electricity generation are integral to the national economy, and its default would impact the continued provision of a key public service. Moreover, Romgaz is involved in strategic projects like Neptun Deep, which further underscores its importance to the country's energy landscape.

Bottom-up Plus One Approach: We view Precedents of Support and Contagion Risk as 'Not strong enough'. We therefore calculate Romgaz's GRE score at 22.5 points. Combined with the 'bb+' SCP, this leads to the SCP plus one notch rating approach, resulting in the 'BBB-' rating.

Strategy Focused on Higher Production: Romgaz's 2021-2030 strategy focuses on enhancing the value of its core activities, natural gas production and trading, while pursuing decarbonisation. Key strategic goals include reducing carbon and methane by at least 10%, limiting annual natural gas production decline from legacy assets to below 2.5%, maintaining an EBITDA margin of 25-40%, and achieving a return on average capital employed of 12% or higher. Romgaz also plans to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

Generous Dividend Payments: Romanian state-owned enterprises have historically been required to distribute at least 50% of net profits as dividends. For 2023, Romgaz was authorised by the government to allocate only 20% of its profits for dividends in 2024 due to anticipated large capex, which is in line with exemptions from dividend policy for state-owned companies realising major energy projects. We expect that Romgaz will return to its standard, higher dividend distributions in 2025. However, the extension of lower dividend payments during Neptun Deep development cannot be ruled out and would represent an upside to our forecasts.

Regulated Gas Prices: In response to the Russia-Ukraine war, the Romanian government implemented regulations to protect consumers in the gas supply market that expire in March 2025. In 2023, 87% of Romgaz's gas sales were at regulated prices of RON150 per megawatt hour (MWh) or USD9.6 per thousand cubic feet (mcf). From April 2024, the capped price reduced to RON120/MWh. Sales at these regulated prices are exempt from windfall taxes, and royalties are based on capped prices. We assume the measures will not be extended, but the impact of an alternative scenario on Romgaz's financials would be positive due to lower taxation from regulated prices.

CCGT Plant in Construction: Romgaz is advancing construction of the Iernut combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant, with RON344 million capex, to be completed by December 2024. Romgaz plans to benefit from sales of electricity on the balancing market, which is expected to increase in importance as renewable electricity generation increases with its inherent output volatility. We expect Iernut CCGT to constitute around 7% of Romgaz's EBITDA in 2027 increasing the company's business diversification, albeit with the upstream segment still the dominant cash flow contributor.

DERIVATION SUMMARY

Energean plc (BB-/Stable) is Romgaz's closest peer, although Romgaz has a more diversified profile with its gas storage and electricity generation, as opposed to Energean's focus on upstream operations. Despite Energean being larger in scale, with production expected to increase from over 100 kboe/d to approximately 185 kboe/d by 2025, it has lower realised prices in the Israeli gas market, compared with Romgaz's European gas price environment. However, Energean has a more favourable cost of production before royalties and is subject to a more advantageous tax regime, although this is counterbalanced by security concerns in light of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.

Historically, Romgaz has maintained a strong financial profile with a net cash position, but this is anticipated to change as growth capital expenditures for Neptun Deep ramp-up. In contrast, Energean is currently in a deleveraging phase as it transitions from growth capex to the production phase of greenfield projects.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

Fitch's Key Assumptions within the Rating Case for the Issuer:

- Natural gas production evolution in line with management guidance

- Title transfer facility (TTF) gas prices at USD10/mcf in 2024, USD10/mcf in 2023, USD8/mcf in 2026, USD7/mcf in 2027 and USD5/mcf after

- Oil prices at USD80/bbl in 2024, USD70/bbl in 2025, USD65/bbl in 2026-2027 and USD60/bbl after

- Capex in line with management guidance

- Dividends at around 50% of previous year net income from 2025

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade

- An upgrade is unlikely at least in the short term unless there is a material improvement in Romgaz's business profile through diversification, or a significant increase in upstream production beyond the currently forecast level after Neptun Deep and Caragele development while maintaining a conservative financial profile

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade

- Negative rating action on Romania's sovereign rating

- Weaker ties with the sovereign

- Problems in development of new upstream assets or EBITDA net leverage well above 2.0x after the capex-intensive period would be negative for the SCP and the IDR

LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE

Satisfactory Liquidity: Romgaz's liquidity needs for 2024 are covered through cash on balance sheet. Beyond 2024, we expect Romgaz to raise debt to fund its increased capex.

ISSUER PROFILE

Romgaz is 70% state-owned and 30% publicly traded on the Bucharest Stock Exchange and carries out operations in oil and gas upstream, gas storage and supply and electricity generation. Romgaz's 2023 production amounted to 83kboe/d, while Fitch adjusted EBITDA totalled RON5.6 billion.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 24. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region has upheld Gazprom Export's claim against the Czech Republic's CEZ banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

In case of violation of the ban, the court ruled to recover 57.7 mln euro from the Czech company in favor of Gazprom Export.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company CEZ a. s. from continuing proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce <...>. In case CEZ a. s. fails to comply with the ruling of the court on this case <...> an award in favor of Gazprom Export LLC [in the amount of] 57,734,000 euros in rubles at the rate of the Bank of Russia will be paid by the company CEZ a. s.,"" the judge said.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that CEZ be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva, and that it be fined if CEZ failed to comply with the judicial act.

It was reported in February 2023 that the Czech energy company CEZ (70% of shares owned by the state) had initiated an arbitration worth $45 mln against Gazprom Export due to a gas shortfall in 2022.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts. The Russian company won all its claims to ban the continuation of legal proceedings abroad.

Gazprom Export has also filed similar lawsuits against Swiss DXT Commodities, French Engie and Czech innogy Energie, with hearings scheduled for May 24 and June 19.",tass.com,news,TASS,,-0.06666666666666665,454235982,1,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,eng-9589934

CEZ seeks $44 million compensation from Gazprom for reduced gas supplies, citing Russian compliance with agreed arbitration clauses amidst geopolitical tensions.

An International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) tribunal has prohibited Russia's Gazprom from continuing with Russian legal proceedings against CEZ, the Czech energy company said. In a statement late on Thursday, CEZ said the ICC Tribunal granted a request confirming that disputes between the companies should be resolved in ICC arbitration, not in Russian courts.

In February 2023, CEZ sought compensation of around 1 billion crowns ($44 million) from Gazprom due to lower-than-contracted gas supplies in 2022, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin-controlled energy giant Gazprom last month filed lawsuits against CEZ and others as it aimed to move court cases to Russia from international arbitration.

CEZ said in its statement that Gazprom was bound by an arbitration clause agreed with CEZ under which disputes related to gas supplies would be settled before the ICC. It had applied for an interim measure in this instance, which was given. ""The Tribunal granted our request, confirming that disputes between the companies should be resolved in ICC arbitration, not in front of Russian courts,"" CEZ said.

Gazprom did not immediately reply to a request for comment. On Wednesday, a Russian court ruling banned Austrian energy company OMV Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from pursuing arbitration proceedings in Stockholm against Gazprom's exporting arm.

The court threatened to fine OMV 575.2 million euros. OMV said it considered the Russian legal proceedings to be illegitimate. The Czech Republic was nearly completely dependent on Russian gas supplies, mostly through the Nord Stream pipeline and Germany, until 2022 when Russia reduced shipments as relations with the West deteriorated sharply. It has replaced supplies with pipeline and LNG gas from other sources.

Specifically, the issue affects the ""26"" sticker, which is intended to have a yellow background. Unfortunately, due to exposure to sunlight, these stickers are prone to fading from their original yellow color to either a clear or white appearance.

This defect has the potential to impact any MVI sticker issued from January 1, 2024, to the present date. Vehicle owners who have received these 2026 MVI stickers should be aware of the potential for fading. However, it is crucial to understand that the validity of these stickers remains unchanged. Even if the background color fades, the MVI stickers are still considered valid, and vehicle owners are not required to take any action regarding this defect.

The Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles (OMV) is fully aware of the situation and is actively working to address the issue. Efforts are underway to replace the current unissued inventory with stickers that do not have this defect. While this process is ongoing, the OMV assures vehicle owners that the integrity and validity of their MVI stickers are not compromised by the fading issue.

The identification of this defect underscores the commitment of the Louisiana State Police and the OMV to maintaining transparency and ensuring that the public is well-informed about any potential issues affecting vehicle compliance. Vehicle owners are encouraged to continue displaying their MVI stickers as usual and to monitor any further updates from the OMV regarding this matter.

In summary, while the 2026 MVI stickers may fade from yellow to clear or white due to sun exposure, they remain valid. Vehicle owners do not need to take any corrective measures.

The Dutch TTF Natural Gas Futures, the benchmark for Europe's gas trading, hit on Wednesday their highest level since January after Austria's OMV warned the market that Russian state giant Gazprom could halt natural gas supply to Austria due to a foreign court ruling that could interrupt OMV payments to Gazprom Export.

The Austrian company assured the market that its unit OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH (OGMT) ""would still be able to supply its contractual customers with gas from alternative, non-Russian sources, through its extensive diversification efforts over the last several years.""

""In March, 93% of Austria's gas imports came from Russia. While a potential stoppage in these flows could lead to some localised tightening in the gas market, Europe as a whole should manage,"" Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey wrote in a note on Thursday.

Planned maintenance at some of Norway's gas assets at the end of this month has also pushed up European gas prices.

Moreover, LSEG data cited by Reuters showed on Thursday that weather forecasters expect a sharp drop in wind speeds in northwest Europe from Friday. Germany, for example, is set to see wind speeds below the average for the season for the next two weeks.

At the end of last month, portfolio managers boosted their bullish bets on Europe's benchmark natural gas price to the highest level in six months, expecting continued volatility as Europe is now beginning to stockpile supplies for the next winter.

Money managers have been concerned that unplanned outages in Norway during the summer, higher natural gas demand in Asia, and the end of the current gas transit deal for Russian pipeline gas to flow via Ukraine at the end of 2024 could sap gas supply for Europe and boost prices.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,,0.1372549019607843,454181543,9,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/news/718x300/2024-05-23_uaymealugx.jpg,eng-9589934

The energy commodity has been on a tear over the past month and is having its best performance since 2022. But can natural gas sustain the momentum?

July natural gas futures tumbled $0.045, or 1.47%, to $3.007 per million British thermal units (Btu) at 14:43 GMT on Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Natural gas prices are on track for a weekly gain of about 27%, adding to their year-to-date increase of roughly 32%.

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), domestic inventories of natural gas advanced 78 billion cubic feet for the week ending May 17, up from 70 billion cubic feet in the previous week. This was slightly below the consensus estimate of 84 billion cubic feet.

The supply injections were broad-based, led by the East (29 billion cubic feet), the Midwest (22 billion cubic feet), and South Central (15 billion cubic feet).

In total, US inventories stand at 2.711 trillion cubic feet, up 402 billion cubic feet from the same time a year ago. They are also 606 billion cubic feet above the five-year average of 2.105 trillion cubic feet.

Traders are betting that the US storage surplus is gradually shrinking and are trying to get out in front.

Meanwhile, investors were jubilant over a new research report that suggested natural gas prices will recover and average $3 per million British thermal units (Btu) by next year.

According to Phil Flynn, an energy strategist at The PRICE Futures Group, natural gas prices are finding support from bolstered demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG).

""If you believe the global natural gas crisis is over, you better think again,"" he wrote in an analyst note. ""Energy Intelligence reported that European natural gas prices jumped to their highest levels in over four months on Wednesday after Austria's OMV warned that its supply may be cut off by Russia's Gazprom.""

In other energy markets, July West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures rose $0.23, or 0.3%, to $77.80 per barrel. July Brent crude futures added $0.32, or 0.39%, to $82.22 a barrel. July gasoline futures added $0.0139, or 0.56%, to $2.4817 per gallon.

Raising rates in an election year is fraught with political fallout so even if inflation stays red hot, I can't imagine that a rate increase would be possible this year, unless of course Donald Trump becomes President.

Regardless, the Fed minutes broke oil, but as bad as it looked, the support was not broken. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status report showed a decent snapback in gasoline to 9.315 million barrels a day(mbpd) and diesel demand up to 3.883 mbd. That improved the lagging four-week average on demand to 8.9 mbd, now just 1.8% below year ago levels. Distillate improved to 3.7 mbd, down 6.1%.

Global oil demand expectations rose after the India flash PMI climbed to 61.7 in May from 61.5 in April. That was the third fastest pace upturn in oil hungry India output since Jul-2010 and was partially fueled by Russian oil imports. How is that price cap thing working? The report said that services drove the growth amid acceleration in business activity. Now Jodi is reporting that India's total product demand was nearly at the same level month over month at 5.6 mb/d but was 3.4% above the previous year's level.

The oil market is preparing for the June OPEC online meeting. The oil market should comment that OPEC decided to hold the meeting online, but they may have a surprise already baked into the online meeting.

The key issue that currently moves oil prices is whether or not OPEC will extend production cuts into 2025. While that is unlikely, in an online meeting there's no doubt about the commitment by OPEC plus to continue along the path that they are on.

Amena Bakr points out that, ""commitment among the OPEC+ alliance to the cuts is strong, and countries that have been overproducing their quotas are compensating for the increased volumes."" So, OPEC plus may do whatever it takes to keep the oil market tight and if demand surges, the supply deficit will occur.

US oil inventories are still higher than most thought they would be at this point as supply at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point hit 36.3 million barrels, the highest level since July. Yet stagnant US oil output, at least according to EIA data, suggests that as the refining season kicks in that could change very quickly. The EIA says that US production has been stuck at 13.1-million-barrel day. Is that a sign that we are seeing a peak in production? Or is it a sign that the EIA just gave up on updating weekly production numbers?

Regardless, the EIA's snapshot of supply puts U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) with an increase by 1.8 million barrels from the previous week. At 458.8 million barrels, {{8849|U.S. crcrude oil inventories are about 3% below the five-year average for this time of year. Total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 0.9 million barrels from last week and are about 2% below the five-year average for this time of year. So, both demand and supply are below year ago levels. Distillate fuel inventories increased by 0.4 million barrels last week and are about 7% below the five-year average for this time of year.

The EIA is also putting out an alert about the upcoming hurricane season. The EIA said, ""Meteorologists are forecasting a particularly intense Atlantic hurricane season this year; they expect 20-25 named storms with a possibility of 30 or more, according to reports from AccuWeather in April.

Colorado State University similarly forecasts an estimated 23 named storms this year. The potential for a stronger hurricane season suggests heightened risk for weather-related production outages in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. With this type of a forecast coming from the Energy Information Administration, it's probably critical that you get your Fox Weather app downloaded on your phone.

Oil prices look like they are still in the process of bottoming here even with the weakness thrown at it. It's probably a perfect time to start getting back in and building a position slowly.

Gold prices did take a hit after the Federal Reserve minutes but also there are concerns that high prices might cure high prices in India's red hot economy. Reuters reported that, ""India's gold imports in 2024 could fall by nearly a fifth from the previous year, as record high prices spur retail consumers to exchange old jewelry for new items, the head of an industry body told Reuters. Lower imports by India, the world's second biggest consumer of the precious metal, could cap a rally that carried global prices to a record this week.

Natural gas prices sizzled after early weakness yesterday. Increase in the demand for LNG potential for weather related demand is causing the resurgence in natural gas prices with the best run in 2 years. EBW Analytics warns that, ""While the immediate term outlook may feature a retreat into Memorial Day weekend as CDDs peak and June final settlement awaits, the medium-to-long term outlook may find support amid robust power burns across Texas and the Southeast and glimmers of upside potential for LNG feedgas demand.""

If you believe the global natural gas crisis is over, you better think again.

In the British market, the front-month contract was 3.90 pence higher at 86.70 p/therm by 0945 GMT, while the July price rose by 5.41 pence to 84.40 pence/therm, LSEG data showed.

Total Norwegian exports to Britain are down by 26 million cubic metres (mcm) at 32 mcm/day as volumes have been re-routed to continental Europe.

UK gas-for-power demand is forecast to rise for the day ahead by 22 mcm to 47 mcm/day as wind output is expected to fall, LSEG analysts said.

Peak wind generation in Britain is forecast at 14.5 gigawatts (GW) on Thursday and 6.9 GW on Friday, Elexon data showed. Lower wind output typically increases demand for gas from power plants.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a national election on Wednesday for July 4, which the Conservative party is widely expected to lose to the opposition Labour Party after 14 years in power.

In the Dutch market, the benchmark front-month contract TRNLTTFMc1 was 1.16 euros higher at 35.95 euros per megawatt hour (MWh), its highest level since the end of Dec. 2023.

Wind speeds are expected to drop sharply in north-west Europe also from tomorrow, especially in Germany where it is expected to drop below the seasonal average for the next couple of weeks, LSEG data showed.

Although Norwegian supply has rebounded to continental Europe and it is expected to return close to maximum levels when the end of maintenance outages early in June, there is still some concern around wider supply.

Thus, Investors will be able to buy the ETF paying a reduced trading commission of 0.26%, in addition to the standard ASF commission of 0.04%. With a total commission of 0.3%, purchasing BET-TRN UCITS via Investimental will be thus the cheapest way for the public to gain exposure to the Romanian capital markets. The investors will be able to buy fund units in the BET-TRN UCITS via all intermediaries that are authorized on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, at standard fees.

Separate to the trading fee applicable upon purchasing the fund units, InterCapital will also apply management cost of 0.6%, giving a total expense ratio of below 1% annually. Keeping costs low ensures that investors effectively benefit from market performance, maximizing the growth potential of their investments.

The current assets under management of the ETF that tracks BET-TRN have surpassed 8 million euros since InterCapital Asset Management has already launched the ETF on the BET-TRN index in the region, with the ETF being traded in euros on the Zagreb Stock Exchange since May 31st, 2023, and on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange since January 23rd, 2024. InterCapital expects that the assets under management will exceed 30 million euros by the end of 2024, driven by both local and international demand.

Since the beginning of 2024, the BET-TRN index has registered a 16.45% increase, outperforming the S&P 500 and STOXX Europe 600, driven by strong performances from both defensive stocks and entrepreneurial companies included in the BET index.",business-review.eu,news,Business Review,Aurel Constantin,0.411764705882353,454158985,1,https://business-review.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BVB-1.jpg,eng-9589119

The complaint was filed just days before the Annual General Meeting of OMV. The company's projects fuel the climate crisis and threaten to exceed the critical 1.5-degree limit, Greenpeace says in a press release.

OMV has committed to aligning its activities with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. By continuing to invest in new fossil projects, OMV is ignoring calls to stop expanding operations in the oil and gas sector and contradicting the OECD's guiding principle, ""act as soon as possible and proactively to avoid adverse environmental impacts,"" the environmental organizations state in their complaint.

""While extreme weather events devastate countries around the world, OMV is pumping billions of dollars into expanding fossil gas extraction operations that harm the climate. Warnings from scientists and the industry to stop expanding the fossil fuel business are being ignored. In the complaint, we show why the expansion of fossil gas projects is not compatible with the OECD Guidelines for responsible business conduct. OMV must end new fossil fuel projects now,"" said Jasmin Duregger, climate and energy expert at Greenpeace Austria.

In the complaint, Greenpeace CEE and Fridays for Future Austria call for stopping the expansion of fossil fuels and the development of the Neptun Deep project. The offshore fossil gas extraction project is carried out by OMV Petrom and Romgaz off the coast of Romania. The companies estimate that exploitation will begin in 2027.

""Where are OMV's billions of investments going? Into fossil fuels. OMV claims to commit to the OECD guidelines for responsible business practices, but this is simply greenwashing. That's why we are filing a complaint now,"" said Jasmin Lang, Fridays for Future Austria.

According to calculations from the environmental impact assessment (EIA), the project will produce 276 million tons of greenhouse gases over 20 years, equivalent to Romania's emissions in three years, Greenpeace and Fridays for Future point out.

On the other side, OMV notes that Neptun Deep is the largest natural gas project in the Romanian area of the Black Sea. During its exploitation, the company says that Neptun Deep is expected to provide a total volume of approximately 100 billion cubic meters of natural gas and transform Romania into the largest gas producer in the European Union.

Earlier this year, Greenpeace sued authorities and companies involved in the Neptun Deep natural gas exploitation project in Romania's Black Sea over irregularities in the approval process. In particular, the NGO sued OMV Petrom and Romgaz, the two partner companies involved in the project.",romania-insider.com,news,Romania Insider,,-0.3568627450980392,454158378,41,https://cdn.romania-insider.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_large_image/public/2024-03/greenpeace_protest_neptun_deep_petrom_-_photo_greenpeace_romania_on_fb.jpeg,

In the British market, the front-month contract was 3.90 pence higher at 86.70 p/therm by 0945 GMT, while the July price rose by 5.41 pence to 84.40 pence/therm, LSEG data showed.

Total Norwegian exports to Britain are down by 26 million cubic metres (mcm) at 32 mcm/day as volumes have been re-routed to continental Europe.

UK gas-for-power demand is forecast to rise for the day ahead by 22 mcm to 47 mcm/day as wind output is expected to fall, LSEG analysts said.

Peak wind generation in Britain is forecast at 14.5 gigawatts (GW) on Thursday and 6.9 GW on Friday, Elexon data showed. Lower wind output typically increases demand for gas from power plants.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a national election on Wednesday for July 4, which the Conservative party is widely expected to lose to the opposition Labour Party after 14 years in power.

In the Dutch market, the benchmark front-month contract was 1.16 euros higher at 35.95 euros per megawatt hour (MWh), its highest level since the end of Dec. 2023.

Wind speeds are expected to drop sharply in north-west Europe also from tomorrow, especially in Germany where it is expected to drop below the seasonal average for the next couple of weeks, LSEG data showed.

Although Norwegian supply has rebounded to continental Europe and it is expected to return close to maximum levels when the end of maintenance outages early in June, there is still some concern around wider supply.

In the United States, one of the companies building the Golden Pass LNG export plant has filed for bankruptcy, citing challenges at the project, which could push back the start-up date.

In addition, Austrian oil and gas group OMV said on Wednesday that gas supplies from Russia's Gazprom may be suspended in connection with a foreign court ruling, without identifying the case. Austria is heavily dependent on Russian gas.

TTF prices settled 4.2% higher yesterday at almost EUR34.39/MWh. This is after the Austrian energy company, OMV, warned that there was a risk that Russian pipeline flows to Austria could be halted after a court ruling that would block payment for natural gas delivered by Russia's Gazprom Export. However, it is unclear if the ruling will be enforced. The supply at risk is 6 bcm per year supplied by Gazprom under a long-term contract to OMV for delivery into Austria. Austria still receives almost all of its gas supplies from Russia. In March, 93% of Austria's gas imports came from Russia. While a potential stoppage in these flows could lead to some localised tightening in the gas market, Europe as a whole should manage.

The latest positioning data shows that investment funds reduced their net long in TTF by 11.66m contracts over the last week to 91.55m contracts as of 17 May, the first decline since early April.

The oil market came under further pressure yesterday. ICE Brent settled a little more than 1% lower on the day, which saw the market close below US$82/bbl - its weakest settlement since February. The downward pressure on oil was part of a broader risk-off move after the latest Fed minutes supported the higher-for-longer narrative when it comes to monetary policy. The weakness in oil prices increases the likelihood that OPEC+ members fully roll over their additional voluntary supply cuts into the second half of the year.

Weekly data from the EIA yesterday showed that US commercial crude oil inventories increased by 1.83m barrels WoW, while crude oil stocks at Cushing increased by 1.33m barrels. For refined products, gasoline stocks fell by 945k barrels and distillate stocks increased by 379k barrels. The fall in gasoline stocks was despite refinery utilisation rates increasing by 1.3pp over the week to 91.7%. Stronger gasoline demand would have contributed to the draw. Implied gasoline demand increased by 440k b/d WoW and this trend should increase as we move into the driving season.

Metal prices came under pressure yesterday as the complex got caught up in the broader risk-off move following the Fed minutes. In addition, as we have mentioned previously, recent price strength in metals, particularly copper, was becoming increasingly detached from short-term fundamentals. Therefore, we would have likely seen some profit-taking from speculators.

The latest data from the World Steel Association (WSA) shows that global steel production declined by 5% YoY to 155.7mt in April, following lower output from major producers like China, Japan, Russia and South Korea. Cumulatively, global steel output fell almost 1% YoY to 625.4mt over the first four months of the year. Chinese steel production decreased 7.2% YoY to 85.9mt last month, whilst cumulative output fell 3% YoY to 343.7mt.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will purchase the stake in the Area 4 concession from Galp Energia SGPS SA, it said in a statement Wednesday. Galp will receive $650 million, and further contingent payments of as much as $500 million when two planned development phases go ahead, the Portugese company said in a separate statement.

The agreement gives Adnoc a share of LNG supply, a fuel that it's betting on for future growth. The company is also scouring the world for deals, including the takeover of German chemical company Covestro AG and the merger of one of its units with a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

In Mozambique, Adnoc will get a share in the 3.5 million-ton-a-year Coral South development LNG export project that is currently in operation. A proposed expansion called Coral North could produce the same amount of fuel from a floating export vessel. Another project planned to be based onshore called Rovuma is projected to have capacity to produce 18 million tons of LNG a year.

It follows Adnoc's first acquisition in the US earlier this week when it picked up a share in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG project in Texas, along with supply from a planned expansion of the plant.

The deal into Mozambique -- where attacks by militant groups linked with Islamic State have ramped up near the project site -- is also the latest example of the UAE's move to boost its influence in Africa. Earlier this year, the country agreed to invest $35 billion in Egypt, potentially saving the economy.

In 2022, the UAE pledged $52.8 billion in foreign direct investments in Africa, when it first topped FDI rankings, according to data from fDi Markets. That figure fell to $44.5 billion in 2023 -- still nearly twice that of Beijing, which came in second.

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

""We've made it very clear that we're interested in key sectors when it comes to low carbon solutions, renewables, natural gas and chemicals,"" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth, said in an interview Monday after the company announced the US deal. ""We're executing on our strategy and our strategy is clear. It's a milestone with hopefully more to come.""

Adnoc will take Galp's place in the Rovuma and Coral projects. The company will join Eni SpA, Exxon Mobil Corp., China National Petroleum Corp., Korea Gas Corp. and Mozambique's state producer Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos E.P.

Mozambique's Area 4 includes Eni's $7 billion floating Coral South Project that began shipping LNG in 2022 and a similar planned offshore production facility. Exxon said earlier this month that it expects a final investment decision for the onshore Rovuma project by the end of 2025.",energyvoice.com,news,Energy Voice,Mathew Perry,0.3098039215686275,454143633,1,https://www.energyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/04/410647156-1j9ymle6d.jpg,eng-9583498

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and Paris-based BNP Paribas both said the Bank of England will still begin cutting borrowing costs this summer from their 16-year highs.

It comes after the consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April, its lowest level in nearly three years, after a record decline in energy prices.

However, money markets were spooked by strong services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England and fell less than expected from 6pc to 5.9pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November - and are only pricing in one reduction this year.

Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas had both predicted a first cut in borrowing costs in June but said this would now come in August.

Goldman analyst Sven Jari Stehn said this would ""provide two more rounds of inflation and labour market data, which we expect to show renewed inflation progress"".

In a note to clients, BNP Paribas said it was still forecasting three cuts this year from 5.25pc to 4.5pc, which it expects in August, September and November.

Federal Reserve minutes show rate-setters retain faith in hitting inflation target

The US Federal Reserve has just released minutes from its interest-rate decision body, the Federal Open Market Committee, for their meeting on April 30 to May 1.

They indicate that, despite disappointment over recent inflation readings, rate-setters still had faith price pressures would ease, if only slowly.

The minutes said:

While the policy response for now would ""involve maintaining"" the central bank's benchmark policy rate at its current level, the minutes also reflected discussion of possible further hikes. They say:

The minutes also reflected debate about just how restrictive current monetary policy is given the strength of the economy, an important discussion given the need for policy to be ""sufficiently"" restrictive to cool inflation.

Officials since that meeting have tamped down expectations for imminent interest rate cuts, which investors now see beginning in September.

But even as Fed officials acknowledged the risk of inflation pressures again building in the economy, they largely viewed the data from the start of the year as a temporary setback in the battle to return inflation to the central bank's 2pc target.

European Space Agency awards contracts in push for European answer to SpaceX

The European Space Agency said today that it has selected two companies to develop a vehicle to transport cargo to the International Space Station by 2028, in a move to ensure a European alternative to SpaceX.

The intergovernmental agency, which counts the UK as a member, has recently struggled to find rockets to launch its missions into space, and is following in the footsteps of Nasa by purchasing services from firms rather than developing them itself.

In November, the ESA launched a competition allocating up to €75m (£63.8m) to a maximum of three firms to build a vehicle to take cargo to the ISS and back.

Out of seven proposals, the ESA selected those from Franco-German The Exploration Company and Franco-Italian company Thales Alenia Space, each of which will receive €25m. A third contract award to a division of France's ArianeGroup may also occur, according to the FT, if a revised proposal can be agreed.

The contracts, which run until June 2026, will focus on developing the technology and structure of the vehicles.

Worries about new Chinese tariffs push down European shares

European stocks closed at a one-week low today, hurt by a sell-off in carmakers following a report about possible Chinese tariffs on imported cars, while tech stocks ticked higher ahead of US-based Nvidia's results.

European automakers fell 1.4pc to a more than three-month low, with shares of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen falling between 0.7pc and 1.7pc.

China should raise its import tariffs on large gasoline-powered cars to 25pc, a car research body affiliated with the Chinese government told the Asian giant's Global Times newspaper, as the country faces sharply higher US car import duties and possibly additional duties to enter the European Union.

The European Commission launched an investigation in October into whether fully-electric cars manufactured in China were receiving unfair subsidies and warranted extra tariffs. The EU could impose provisional duties in July.

The Europe-wide STOXX 600 index dipped 0.3pc, also pressured by a tick up in sovereign bond yields after data showed UK inflation eased less than expected in April.

Tech stocks were a bright spot, up 0.6pc as investors awaited quarterly results from AI darling Nvidia this evening to gauge if the recent market rally could continue.

Wall Street struggles for direction as it awaits Nvidia results

Wall Street's main indexes struggled for direction this afternoon as investors kept to the sidelines ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia's quarterly results and minutes of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, both due this evening.

Eyes will be on whether semiconductor bellwether Nvidia's first-quarter results, due after markets close, can meet sky-high expectations and sustain the bumper gains the company's shares and other AI-related stocks recorded.

Nvidia has emerged as the third-largest US company by market value after a more-than 92pc surge in its shares this year after a large jump in 2023.

The company's shares were down 0.5pc today, after hitting a nearly two-month high on Tuesday.

Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said:

Wall Street's recent bull run has carried all three major indexes to record highs this month, driven by a strong earnings season as well as renewed hopes for interest-rate cuts and a so-called soft landing for the US economy.

Raspberry Pi confirms London float will take place next month

Raspberry Pi has confirmed aims to list in London next month in a boost to the capital's flagging stock market.

The Cambridge-based firm - known for affordable credit card-sized computers designed to boost coding skills among children - has revealed plans to raise $40m (£31.4m) in new money as part of the initial public offering (IPO) on London's main market.

The IPO is a welcome victory for the London market, which has been hit by a swathe of UK-listed firms being bought out or defecting abroad.

Arm and fellow Raspberry Pi investor Lansdowne Partners have agreed to also buy $35m (£27.5 million) and $20m (£15.7 million) worth of shares respectively as part of the plans.

Raspberry Pi was founded by computer scientist Eben Upton in 2008, before releasing its first product in 2012.

It has since sold more than 60m of its single board computers alone.

It is a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation - a UK charity founded when the company was set up in 2008, with the goal of promoting interest in computer science among young people.

As a major shareholder in Raspberry Pi, the foundation has received around $50m (£39.7 million) in dividends since 2013, which has been used to advance its educational mission globally, according to the group.

The FTSE 100 lost 0.6pc today. The top riser was M&S, up 5.2pc, followed by packaging group DS Smith, up 2.6pc. The biggest faller was miner Antofagasta, down 6.4pc, followed by fellow miner Glencore, down 3.4pc.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 dipped 0.3pc. The biggest riser was investment platform group IntegraFin, up 11pc, followed by pub operator Mitchells & Butler, up 10pc. The biggest faller was City firm Close Brothers, down 6.7pc, followed by Pets and Home, down 5.9pc.

US says new tariffs on Chinese goods start in August

Some of the steep US tariff increases on an array of Chinese imports, including electric vehicles and their batteries, computer chips and medical products, will take effect on August 1, US officials said on Wednesday.

President Joe Biden will keep tariffs put in place by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump while ratcheting up others, including a quadrupling of import duties on Chinese EVs to 100pc and a doubling of semiconductor duties to 50pc.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative, which advises the president on trade policy and conducts trade negotiations, is seeking comments on the effects of the proposed tariff increases on the US economy, including consumers, and on whether a proposed 25pc duty on medical masks, gloves and a planned 50pc tariff on syringes should be higher.

The United States imported nearly $640m (£503m) of gloves, masks and syringes last year from China that will be affected by the new measures.

The proposed Chinese tariff increases include ""products targeted by China for dominance, or are products in sectors where the United States has recently made significant investments.""

Washington is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax subsidies to develop American EV, solar and other new industries, and has said China's state-driven excess production capacity in these sectors threatens the viability of US companies. The tariffs are meant to protect American jobs from a feared flood of cheap Chinese imports.

Disney is selling its stake in an Indian pay-TV business to Tata, according to a report.

Goverments vow to cooperate against AI risks at Seoul summit

More than a dozen countries and some of the world's biggest tech firms pledged today to cooperate against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, including its ability to dodge human control, as they wrapped up a global summit in Seoul.

AI safety was front and centre of the agenda at the two-day gathering. In the latest declaration, more than two dozen countries including the Britain, the United States and France agreed to work together against threats from cutting-edge AI, including ""severe risks"".

Such risks could include an AI system helping ""non-state actors in advancing the development, production, acquisition or use of chemical or biological weapons"", said a joint statement from the nations.

These dangers also include an AI model that could potentially ""evade human oversight, including through safeguard circumvention, manipulation and deception, or autonomous replication and adaptation"", they added.

The ministers' statement followed a commitment on Tuesday by some of the biggest AI companies, including ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google DeepMind, to share how they assess the risks of their tech, including what is considered ""intolerable"".

The 16 tech firms also committed to not deploying a system where they cannot keep risks under those limits.

The Seoul summit, co-hosted by South Korea and Britain, was organised to build on the consensus reached at the inaugural AI safety summit last year.

Bloomberg reported that Ms Choe's departure adds to the ""wall of worry"" in the company's near term, according to a note by Raymond James analyst Rick Patel.

Sales of previously occupied US homes sank last month, pushed down by high mortgage rates and rising prices.

Existing home sales fell 1.9pc to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14m from a revised 4.2m in March, the National Association of Realtors said.

The average price of previously occupied homes rose 5.7pc to $407,600 -- the tenth straight increase and a record for April.

Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, called the sales drop ""a little frustrating.'' Economists had expected sales to come in at 4.2m.

The rate on the benchmark 30-year, fixed-rate loan has risen five of the last six weeks and stands at 7.02pc, up from 6.39pc a year ago.

Would-be homebuyers are also deterred by the high prices, caused partly by a tight inventory of available homes.

Bank of England will cut interest rates in August, says Goldman Sachs

Interest rates will be cut in August, according to major investment banks, even after inflation came in higher than expected last month.

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and Paris-based BNP Paribas both said the Bank of England will still begin cutting borrowing costs this summer.

It comes after the consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April, its lowest level in nearly three years, after a record decline in energy prices.

However, money markets were spooked by strong services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England and fell less than expected from 6pc to 5.9pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November - and are only pricing in one reduction this year.

Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas had both predicted a first cut in borrowing costs in June but said this would now come in August.

Goldman analyst Sven Jari Stehn said this would ""provide two more rounds of

inflation and labour market data, which we expect to show renewed inflation progress"".

Wall Street's main stock indexes were subdued at the opening bell ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia's quarterly results and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes, released later in the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at the open to 39,863.33.

BHP chief executive Mike Henry said the merger offered a ""compelling opportunity"", which would have given would Anglo American shareholders 17.8pc of a new combined venture.

Falling inflation is 'unalloyed good news,' says former minister

Conservative former Treasury minister Sir Robert Syms said the inflation statistics were ""unalloyed good news"" for the country.

He said: ""I think that should be rejoiced by everybody in this House, including people on the other side, who might actually end up in Government, inherit the benefit of some of the things that this government is doing. In truth I'm always a little surprised by, when good news comes along, how miserable the opposition gets.""

Treasury Minister Bim Afolami replied: ""I do disagree with him on one key measure, I must admit, which is the idea that they might inherit this because of course, we are not complete yet.

""We know that the economy still needs to continue to turn. We know that inflation needs to come down. We hope that that will lead in due course to falling interest rates as well, and for the measures that we put in place to come to fruition over the next parliament.""

Conservative former Treasury minister Richard Fuller said Mr Afolami was ""right to make the point that people are continuing to find economic difficulties at this time and that we need to stick with the Prime Minister's plan.

""Right to point out the terrible risks to the economy that the Labour Party's policies on labour markets and on taxes will do, and right to say that there have been external factors and that is different when you tackle external factors that are one offs from what your policies are, looking forward.""

Nasa delays crewed Boeing Starliner launch for third time

The first crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station has again been delayed, according to Nasa, with no new date immediately set.

The postponement of the launch, which had been set for Saturday, marks the third delay this month for the highly anticipated mission.

It would allow Nasa to certify a second commercial vehicle to carry crews to the ISS, beyond Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Earlier this month, the Starliner launch was postponed just hours before liftoff, with the astronauts already strapped in, due to a separate technical issue.

Read how it created turmoil in financial markets.

The German economy is expected to have grown gently in the second quarter after a positive first three months of the year, the Bundesbank said.

The German central bank said in its monthly report that economic output ""is likely to increase slightly again"" during the period.

Europe's largest economy exceeded expectations in the first quarter, when it posted growth of 0.2pc.

The positive figures came as a relief after German output shrunk by 0.5pc in the last quarter of 2023 at the end of a difficult period of high inflation.

An improvement in the services sector was behind much of the rising German growth figures.

Businesses in the sector could see their ""recovery continue"", the Bundesbank said.

Oil prices have slumped towards their lowest level in three months amid signs of rising stockpiles in the US.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, has fallen 0.7pc towards $82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has dropped 0.7pc to near $78.

The American Petroleum Institute reported crude stockpiles rose by 2.5m barrels last week, according to Bloomberg.

Brent is around 7pc higher so far this year amid cuts to supply by the Opec+ cartel, but prices have cooled since mid-April.

US stock markets are on track to begin the day lower ahead of AI chip maker Nvidia's quarterly results and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes due later in the day.

All eyes will be on semiconductor bellwether Nvidia's first-quarter results, due after market close. Analysts are keen to see if it can meet the market's sky-high expectations.

Nvidia has emerged as the third-largest US company by market value after a more than 92pc surge in its shares this year and an over three-fold jump in 2023.

The company's shares were down 0.5pc in premarket trading, after rising over 3pc over the past two days.

Market participants are also keenly awaiting minutes from the US central bank's latest policy meeting for more clarity on the timing of rate cuts.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was down 0.2pc, and the Nasdaq 100 had fallen 0.2pc.

Culture Secretary backs Ofcom over GB News impartiality ruling

The Culture Secretary has backed Ofcom after the regulator warned GB News that it could consider fining it or revoking its licence over recent impartiality breaches.

Lucy Frazer was grilled by MPs at the Culture, Media and Sport Committe about a recent finding by the broadcasting regulator, which found that the People's Forum: The Prime Minister broke impartiality rules.

The watchdog said it was starting the ""process for consideration of a statutory sanction against GB News"" following a ""serious and repeated breach"" of the rules and the hour-long programme where Rishi Sunak took questions from the audience.

Ms Frazer said: ""I think that Ofcom is doing its job in terms of making sure that the Broadcasting Code is complied with.""

When asked if the media regulator had been ""tolerant"" of GB News, Ms Frazer appeared to defend Ofcom saying that it has ""found various breaches"" of the channel.

""I would say Ofcom is doing its job,"" she added.

Tesla sales drop by quarter in Britain, official figures show

In corporate news, Tesla sales slumped across Europe last month as governments reduced the subsidies offered to buyers of electric cars.

Tesla registrations in Britain fell by a quarter in April and have slumped 14pc in the first four months of the year.

The carmaker registered just 13,951 vehicles in April, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said, which was down by 2.3pc from last year and its worst total since January 2023.

It comes despite chief executive Elon Musk previously insisting that he expected the car maker's second quarter results would be ""a lot better"".

Germany and Sweden have been among the major economies to have ceased or reduced subsidies for electric vehicles in recent months, which has put a damper on Europe's sales growth.

The coupon on two-year gilts, which are more sensitive to changes in interest rates - has jumped nearly 12 basis points to 4.4pc.

The pound has hit its highest level in two months against both the dollar and the euro as money markets indicated the first interest rate cut by the Bank of England could come as late as November.

BT fined £2.8m for failing to provide contract information to customers

Away from today's inflation news, BT has been fined £2.8m by the industry watchdog after EE and Plusnet failed to provide clear and simple contract information to more than a million customers before they signed up.

Ofcom said that since June 2022, BT's EE and Plusnet businesses made more than 1.3m sales without providing customers with a contract summary and information documents, which affected at least 1.1m customers.

This meant that BT broke the regulator's consumer protection rules, which came into effect in 2022 and are designed to ensure customers get clear, comparable information about the services they are considering buying.

Ofcom said the fine ""reflects the seriousness of this breach"".

Ofcom brought in the rules in June 2022 and said BT had assured it that the group was confident the deadline would be met.

But the watchdog said its investigation found that, from January 2022, BT was aware that some of its sales would not meet the deadline. Ofcom said:

A BT spokesman said: ""We're sorry that some of our pre-contract information and contract summary documents were not available to some of our customers in a timely manner. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and have taken steps to proactively contact affected customers and arrange for them to receive the information and be refunded where applicable.""

He pointed to cost-of-living support the Government had offered, adding: ""The result of those difficult decisions, and they were difficult because in the end we had to put up taxes for those decisions, but the result is living standards have gone up since Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister.""

In a testy exchange, Mr Hunt could earlier be heard to insist ""me too"" when host Emma Barnett said she was interested in people's household finances.

Although traders have reacted strongly to the latest inflation figures, many economists still think summer interest rate cuts remain a possibility.

Suren Thiru, ICAEW economics director, said: ""Lingering concerns over underlying inflationary pressures mean a June rate cut is unlikely.

""However, these figures may convince more rate setters to vote to ease policy, providing a signal that a summer rate cut is still possible.""

Julian Jessop, economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, said he believed a rate cut in June is ""still in play"".

It notched up an 11.3pc jump in like-for-like food sales over the year, with growth of 5.2pc across its clothing and home arm.

The group said it was upping its cost-cutting target by another £100m to £500m by 2027-28 as it looks to offset rising staff wages.

The company said: ""With continuing cost headwinds, notably from investment in colleague pay, the structural cost programme is critical to our profit progression.""

It said it was in the ""strongest financial health since 1997"" and was confident of making ""further progress"" over the financial year ahead.

FTSE 100 slumps as interest rate cuts expected to be delayed

Stock markets have slipped after inflation fell by less than expected, delivering a blow to hopes of a June interest rate cut.

The benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 0.6pc, while the pound strengthened against the dollar and touched a two-month high at $1.275.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped 0.4pc.

It comes as markets are now pegging a mere 16pc chance of a June rate cut by the Bank of England, a dip from the nearly 60pc that was priced in last week.

Despite UK inflation edging closer to the Bank of England's target, its slowdown fell short of expectations, with services inflation proving to be persistent.

Markets also have Nvidia's quarterly results on the radar that is due later in the day, and could spark a $200bn swing in the AI-darling's shares.

In corporate news, Marks & Spencer jumped 8.7pc to the top of the FTSE 100 after the retailer reported a 58pc rise in annual profit, which was ahead of market expectations.

SSE fell 2.3pc after the power generator and network operator posted a lower annual adjusted operating profit.

Responding to the inflation figures, Rishi Sunak told reporters:

There is still ""much more to be done"" to drive down inflation, Labour's Darren Jones has said, pointing to energy measures which could prevent inflationary spikes in the UK in future.

The shadow Treasury minister acknowledged inflation had ""come down a bit"" when speaking to Sky News, but said this was ""largely driven by a drop in the energy price cap"".

He added: ""Core inflation is still around 3.6pc to 3.9pc, which is hotter than the markets were expecting it to be. This is not out of the woods yet. It is in the right direction but there is still much more to be done.""

Mr Jones pointed to Labour's ""securonomics"" agenda, which includes measures to build ""homegrown, secure, renewable energy"".

UK stock markets declined at the open as inflation fell by less than expected at the start of the year.

First interest rate cut not expected until November despite fall in inflation

Hopes of a summer interest rate cut have been dashed for mortgage holders after inflation fell less than expected last month.

The consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April - its lowest level in nearly three years - after a record decline in energy prices.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the sharp decline indicated that ""brighter days are ahead"" but economists had expected inflation to drop to 2.1pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November.

They are also only pricing in one interest rate cut this year, compared to two before the latest inflation figures were published.

Services sector points to 'difficult last mile' on inflation, say analysts

Services inflation, a critical indicator for Bank of England policymakers, dipped slightly from 6pc in March to 5.9pc in April in a blow to hopes for early rate cuts.

The figure was higher than forecasts of a drop to 5.4pc, driven by more volatile aspects of the sector, such as hotels and live music.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, fell from 4.2pc to 3.9pc, which was higher than predictions of a drop to 3.6pc.

The weaker than expected decline in inflation was another example of inflation figures ""developing a nasty habit of coming in hot"", according to analysts.

Britain's deficit balloons to £20.5bn in setback for Hunt's tax cut plans

Public borrowing has overshot forecasts in April, leaving Jeremy Hunt with less room to cut taxes this year in a pre-election giveaway.

The deficit stood at £20.5bn in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This is £1.2bn more than the £19.3bn forecast just two months ago by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's tax and spending watchdog.

Public borrowing in the tax year ending in March has also been revised higher by £0.8bn to £121.4bn, outpacing forecasts by the Government's spending watchdog by £7.3bn.

The figures are a blow to Conservative Party's prospects of narrowing a 27-point poll gap with Labour by wooing voters with further reductions in national insurance.

While public sector receipts from income like taxation was £1.6bn higher in April than a year earlier, spending has grown at nearly twice the pace at £3.1bn.

Alex Kerr at Capital Economics said: ""The Chancellor will be disappointed that April's figures do not provide more scope for tax cuts at a fiscal event later this year.

""Moreover, we expect slower wage growth to dampen tax receipts growth later this year. And the rise in market interest rates since March's Budget alone suggests he may have even less fiscal headroom (perhaps about £6.5bn) for tax cuts than the £8.9bn left over in March.""

Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, added: ""The headroom to cut taxes doesn't exist, but Chancellor Hunt seems likely to go ahead anyway.""

It comes after inflation figures for April were higher than expected, pushing back market expectations of the first interest rate cut.

Falling inflation may not be enough for early rate cut, warn economists

The sharp decline in inflation takes the consumer prices index closer to the Bank of England's 2pc target but may not be enough to trigger an early interest rate cut by its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), according to economists.

Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said:

Other economists also signalled their disappointment with the figures:

Pound jumps to two-month high as inflation higher than expected

The pound has risen after the sharp decline in inflation was still higher than analysts had expected.

Sterling rose 0.3pc against the dollar to $1.275 - its highest level since March - after the consumer prices index dropped to 2.3pc in April, which was higher than forecasts of a fall to 2.1pc.

The pound was up 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth a little over 85p.

Inflation is ""back to normal"" and ""brighter days are ahead"", Rishi Sunak has said in response to the latest figures.

The economy is turning a corner, insists Treasury

The Office for National Statistics has also published borrowing figures this morning, showing that the Government borrowed £20.5bn last month, which was higher than official forecasts.

Energy, tobacco and food prices help lower inflation, says ONS

The dramatic fall in inflation was mainly driven by the lowering of the Ofgem price cap in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

It meant that average household energy bills fell by £238 a year to £1,690 following the shock caused by Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.

The ONS said prices of electricity, gas and other fuels fell by 27.1pc in the year to April, the largest fall on record.

Gas prices fell by 37.5pc on the year, compared with a fall of 26.5pc in the year to March 2024, while electricity prices fell by 21pc, compared with 13pc in March.

Inflation has fallen less than expected, official figures show, in a blow for the Prime Minister and mortgage holders.

The consumer prices index dropped in April from 3.2pc to 2.3pc following a record decline in typical energy bills last month, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The drop takes the pace of price growth to its lowest level since July 2021 but it was far short of analyst expectations of a plunge to 2.1pc.

The higher-than-expected reading could derail hopes for a summer cut to interest rates, which would provide relief to mortgage holders grappling with the highest borrowing costs in 16 years.

It is also a blow to Rishi Sunak, who has said he only wants to call a general election when people ""feel that things are improving"".

Derivatives trades on money markets had indicated the Bank of England would reduce borrowing costs twice by the end of the year from 16-year highs of 5.25pc to 4.75pc.

Traders had priced in a first cut by August and more than a 50pc chance of a first cut in June.

Thanks for joining me. We begin the day with the economic news that has been keenly anticipated by mortgage holders and the Prime Minister.

Inflation fell to 2.3pc in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, raising hopes that interest rate cuts will not be far away.

What happened overnight

Asian shares edged higher as anxious investors dared to hope that Nvidia, the chip maker at the centre of the AI boom, could meet sky-high expectations.

New Zealand's central bank offered a sobering assessment of its inflation problems, warning that rates would have to be higher for longer to bring them to heel in a shock to local markets.

That saw the kiwi dollar jump 0.9pc to a one-month high of $0.6151 as bond yields spiked, while it surged to 17-year peaks on the relatively low-yielding yen.

The company's bb- Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) rating, in the region of speculative investments, benefits from a one-notch uplift as per the Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria, the rating agency explained. This brings the state-controlled company to the investment grade region, in line with the country's sovereign debt.

The rating was issued in light of the FX bonds the company plans to issue to finance its investments.

Romgaz plans to develop Neptun Deep, a deepwater offshore project in the Romanian Black Sea. It acquired a 50% stake in the project from Exxon Mobil for EUR 1 billion in 2022 and it partners with OMV Petrom, Neptun Deep's operator.

With Rothschild Bank as its adviser, Romgaz has hired JP Morgan to lead a consortium of banks that will handle the sale of bonds on the foreign market under an MTN scheme intended to finance Neptun Deep, according to the latest available data.

The MTN scheme would reportedly have a size of EUR 1.5 billion, with a first EUR 500 million tranche issued in H2 this year. The company announced the EUR 500 million bond issue for H2 in January when unveiling the financial planning for 2024.

Regarding the company's rating attached by Fitch, the rating agency explains that the SCP reflects the company's dominant position in Romania's natural gas market, upstream production growth potential from the Neptun Deep and Caragele reservoir developments, and conservative financial policy.

Key rating constraints include its comparatively modest production scale, lack of geographic diversification due to its sole focus on Romania, the aging nature of its legacy gas assets, large capex, and manageable execution risk.",romania-insider.com,news,Romania Insider,,0.1372549019607843,454137902,1,https://cdn.romania-insider.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_large_image/public/featured_images/Romgaz-photo-Romgaz-on-FB.jpg,

Der Vorwurf: Mit dem weiteren Ausbau des fossilen Gasgeschäfts, wie mit Neptun Deep im Schwarzen Meer, befeuert der Konzern die Klimakrise und gefährdet die Einhaltung des 1,5 Grad Limits. Jüngste UN-Berichte, als auch das Net-Zero Szenario der internationalen Energieagentur sprechen eine klare Sprache: Es gibt keinen Platz für die Erschließung neuer fossiler Brennstoffe. Die OMV hat sich verpflichtet, ihr Geschäft an den OECD-Leitsätzen für multinationale Unternehmen auszurichten. Indem die OMV weiter in fossiles Gas investiert, ignoriert sie Aufforderungen, den weiteren Ausbau von Öl und Gas zu beenden und widerspricht dem OECD-Leitsatz ""so früh wie möglich und proaktiv zu handeln, um negative Umweltauswirkungen zu vermeiden"", argumentieren die Umweltschutzorganisationen.

Jasmin Duregger, Klima- und Energieexpertin bei Greenpeace in Österreich: ""Während Wetterextreme bereits Länder rund um den Globus heimsuchen, pumpt die OMV weitere Milliarden in die Expansion des klimaschädlichen Gasgeschäfts. Die Warnungen aus Wissenschaft und Wirtschaft, den weiteren Ausbau des fossilen Geschäfts zu stoppen, werden damit in den Wind geschlagen. In der Beschwerde zeigen wir auf, warum der Ausbau fossiler Energien nicht mit den OECD-Leitsätzen für verantwortungsvolles Wirtschaften zusammen passt. Die OMV muss ihre fossilen Expansionspläne begraben.""

Jasmin Lang von Fridays for Future Österreich: ""Seit Jahren protestieren wir für mehr Klimaschutz, doch die Öl- und Gaskonzerne wie die OMV stellen sich taub. Was hat uns in die Klimakrise getrieben? Fossile Energien. Worin werden weitere Milliarden durch die OMV investiert? Fossile Energien. Das passt doch nicht zusammen! Gleichzeitig zu behaupten, man verpflichtet sich den OECD-Richtlinien für verantwortungsvolles Wirtschaften ist pures Greenwashing. Deswegen legen wir nun Beschwerde ein.""

Nachdem die OECD-Beschwerde eingereicht wurde, hat die Nationale Kontaktstelle der OECD, die in Österreich beim Ministerium für Arbeit und Wirtschaft liegt, drei Monate Zeit, deren Zulässigkeit zu prüfen. In der Beschwerde sprechen sich Greenpeace und Fridays for Future Österreich gegen die Erschließung des Neptun Deep Gasfelds durch die OMV Petrom und Romgaz vor der Küste Rumäniens aus. Ab 2027 soll dort Gas fließen. Über die 20-jährige Laufzeit wird das Projekt laut den Berechnungen in der Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung (UVP) 276 Millionen Tonnen Treibhausgase verursachen. Das sind so viele Treibhausgasemissionen, wie ganz Österreich in dreieinhalb Jahren verursacht. Aktuell ist die umweltrechtliche Genehmigung für das Gasprojekt noch ausständig.

The reason for this is a foreign court ruling that allows a large European energy company to enforce payments from the gas supply contract with Gazprom to this company. If the judgment is enforced against OMV in Austria, OMV would have to make payments from its gas supply contract with Gazprom to the European company. The identity of this company and details of the judgment have not been disclosed.

In the event of such enforcement, OMV believes it is likely that Gazprom could cease gas supplies, which would significantly affect the Austrian gas market. This assessment is based on Gazprom's behavior in similar situations in the past.

Despite this uncertainty, OMV emphasizes that it could continue to supply its contract customers with gas from alternative, non-Russian sources. The Austrian regulatory authority E-Control also confirms that gas supplies are secure for the coming winter. The storage facilities in Austria are already around 77 percent full, and alternative import options via Germany and Italy are available.

Leonore Gewessler, as reported by ORF, the minister responsible for climate protection, is examining current developments and calling on Austrian suppliers to accelerate the development of supply relationships for non-Russian natural gas. At the same time, SPÖ energy spokesman Alois Schroll criticizes the government for its inaction to become independent of Russian gas, as reported by ORF.

Human rights accusations against former OMV executives

Parallel to the discussion about gas supplies, OMV is in the public eye due to serious human rights allegations. The Austrian Centre for the Enforcement of Human Rights International (CEHRI) and the Dutch peace organization PAX have filed a statement of facts with the Vienna public prosecutor's office against former OMV managers. The accusation: aiding and abetting war crimes in Sudan.

Between 1999 and 2003, OMV was part of a consortium that extracted oil in what is now South Sudan. During this time, serious human rights violations were committed by military operations of the Sudanese government, including systematic killings of civilians and violent expulsions. The public prosecutor's office accuses the former managing directors of OMV of knowingly supporting these crimes and thus putting economic interests above human rights.

Two former managing directors of Lundin Energy AB, a business partner of OMV, are currently on trial in Stockholm. They are accused of aiding and abetting war crimes. The evidence in this trial suggests that OMV may also have knowingly contributed to securing the oil production areas. This trial, which is expected to last until 2026, is the first case since the Nuremberg trials in which the activities of a listed company are on trial for war crimes.

OMV rejects all accusations and emphasizes that Lundin, and not it, was in charge of the daily operations in Sudan. Nevertheless, OMV officially supports the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which call for the respect and protection of human rights. In this specific case, however, OMV has offered neither remedy nor reparation to the victims in Sudan.

The allegations and the threat of gas supply disruption are putting OMV under considerable pressure. While the company is trying to secure the gas supply in Austria, the question of responsibility for human rights violations remains unanswered. The coming months will be decisive, both for Austria's energy security and for the reappraisal of OMV's past.",vindobona.org,news,Vindobona.org | Vienna International News,,0.04313725490196085,454101920,64,https://www.vindobona.org/images/text/omv-gazprom-yuzhnoe-russkoye-field.jpg,

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and Paris-based BNP Paribas both said the Bank of England will still begin cutting borrowing costs this summer from their 16-year highs.

It comes after the consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April, its lowest level in nearly three years, after a record decline in energy prices.

The US Federal Reserve has just released minutes from its interest-rate decision body, the Federal Open Market Committee, for their meeting on April 30 to May 1.

They indicate that, despite disappointment over recent inflation readings, rate-setters still had faith price pressures would ease, if only slowly.

The minutes said:

While the policy response for now would ""involve maintaining"" the central bank's benchmark policy rate at its current level, the minutes also reflected discussion of possible further hikes. They say:

The minutes also reflected debate about just how restrictive current monetary policy is given the strength of the economy, an important discussion given the need for policy to be ""sufficiently"" restrictive to cool inflation.

Officials since that meeting have tamped down expectations for imminent interest rate cuts, which investors now see beginning in September.

But even as Fed officials acknowledged the risk of inflation pressures again building in the economy, they largely viewed the data from the start of the year as a temporary setback in the battle to return inflation to the central bank's 2pc target.

The European Space Agency said today that it has selected two companies to develop a vehicle to transport cargo to the International Space Station by 2028, in a move to ensure a European alternative to SpaceX.

The intergovernmental agency, which counts the UK as a member, has recently struggled to find rockets to launch its missions into space, and is following in the footsteps of Nasa by purchasing services from firms rather than developing them itself.

In November, the ESA launched a competition allocating up to €75m (£63.8m) to a maximum of three firms to build a vehicle to take cargo to the ISS and back.

Out of seven proposals, the ESA selected those from Franco-German The Exploration Company and Franco-Italian company Thales Alenia Space, each of which will receive €25m. A third contract award to a division of France's ArianeGroup may also occur, according to the FT, if a revised proposal can be agreed.

The contracts, which run until June 2026, will focus on developing the technology and structure of the vehicles.

Wall Street's main indexes struggled for direction this afternoon as investors kept to the sidelines ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia's quarterly results and minutes of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, both due this evening.

Eyes will be on whether semiconductor bellwether Nvidia's first-quarter results, due after markets close, can meet sky-high expectations and sustain the bumper gains the company's shares and other AI-related stocks recorded.

Nvidia has emerged as the third-largest US company by market value after a more-than 92pc surge in its shares this year after a large jump in 2023.

The company's shares were down 0.5pc today, after hitting a nearly two-month high on Tuesday.

Wall Street's recent bull run has carried all three major indexes to record highs this month, driven by a strong earnings season as well as renewed hopes for interest-rate cuts and a so-called soft landing for the US economy.

Raspberry Pi has confirmed aims to list in London next month in a boost to the capital's flagging stock market.

The Cambridge-based firm - known for affordable credit card-sized computers designed to boost coding skills among children - has revealed plans to raise $40m (£31.4m) in new money as part of the initial public offering (IPO) on London's main market.

The IPO is a welcome victory for the London market, which has been hit by a swathe of UK-listed firms being bought out or defecting abroad.

Arm and fellow Raspberry Pi investor Lansdowne Partners have agreed to also buy $35m (£27.5 million) and $20m (£15.7 million) worth of shares respectively as part of the plans.

Raspberry Pi was founded by computer scientist Eben Upton in 2008, before releasing its first product in 2012.

It has since sold more than 60m of its single board computers alone.

It is a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation - a UK charity founded when the company was set up in 2008, with the goal of promoting interest in computer science among young people.

As a major shareholder in Raspberry Pi, the foundation has received around $50m (£39.7 million) in dividends since 2013, which has been used to advance its educational mission globally, according to the group.

Some of the steep US tariff increases on an array of Chinese imports, including electric vehicles and their batteries, computer chips and medical products, will take effect on August 1, US officials said on Wednesday.

President Joe Biden will keep tariffs put in place by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump while ratcheting up others, including a quadrupling of import duties on Chinese EVs to 100pc and a doubling of semiconductor duties to 50pc.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative, which advises the president on trade policy and conducts trade negotiations, is seeking comments on the effects of the proposed tariff increases on the US economy, including consumers, and on whether a proposed 25pc duty on medical masks, gloves and a planned 50pc tariff on syringes should be higher.

The United States imported nearly $640m (£503m) of gloves, masks and syringes last year from China that will be affected by the new measures.

The proposed Chinese tariff increases include ""products targeted by China for dominance, or are products in sectors where the United States has recently made significant investments.""

Washington is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax subsidies to develop American EV, solar and other new industries, and has said China's state-driven excess production capacity in these sectors threatens the viability of US companies. The tariffs are meant to protect American jobs from a feared flood of cheap Chinese imports.

More than a dozen countries and some of the world's biggest tech firms pledged today to cooperate against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, including its ability to dodge human control, as they wrapped up a global summit in Seoul.

AI safety was front and centre of the agenda at the two-day gathering. In the latest declaration, more than two dozen countries including the Britain, the United States and France agreed to work together against threats from cutting-edge AI, including ""severe risks"".

Such risks could include an AI system helping ""non-state actors in advancing the development, production, acquisition or use of chemical or biological weapons"", said a joint statement from the nations.

These dangers also include an AI model that could potentially ""evade human oversight, including through safeguard circumvention, manipulation and deception, or autonomous replication and adaptation"", they added.

The ministers' statement followed a commitment on Tuesday by some of the biggest AI companies, including ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google DeepMind, to share how they assess the risks of their tech, including what is considered ""intolerable"".

As traders fret over UK inflation falling less than expected from 3.2pc to 2.3pc, take a look at Lebanon's latest data, where the increase in consumer prices slowed from 70.357pc to 59.67pc in April.

Sales of previously occupied US homes sank last month, pushed down by high mortgage rates and rising prices.

Existing home sales fell 1.9pc to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14m from a revised 4.2m in March, the National Association of Realtors said.

The average price of previously occupied homes rose 5.7pc to $407,600 -- the tenth straight increase and a record for April.

Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, called the sales drop ""a little frustrating.'' Economists had expected sales to come in at 4.2m.

The rate on the benchmark 30-year, fixed-rate loan has risen five of the last six weeks and stands at 7.02pc, up from 6.39pc a year ago.

Would-be homebuyers are also deterred by the high prices, caused partly by a tight inventory of available homes.

He said: ""I think that should be rejoiced by everybody in this House, including people on the other side, who might actually end up in Government, inherit the benefit of some of the things that this government is doing. In truth I'm always a little surprised by, when good news comes along, how miserable the opposition gets.""

Treasury Minister Bim Afolami replied: ""I do disagree with him on one key measure, I must admit, which is the idea that they might inherit this because of course, we are not complete yet.

""We know that the economy still needs to continue to turn. We know that inflation needs to come down. We hope that that will lead in due course to falling interest rates as well, and for the measures that we put in place to come to fruition over the next parliament.""

Conservative former Treasury minister Richard Fuller said Mr Afolami was ""right to make the point that people are continuing to find economic difficulties at this time and that we need to stick with the Prime Minister's plan.

""Right to point out the terrible risks to the economy that the Labour Party's policies on labour markets and on taxes will do, and right to say that there have been external factors and that is different when you tackle external factors that are one offs from what your policies are, looking forward.""

The first crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station has again been delayed, according to Nasa, with no new date immediately set.

The US space agency said: ""The next possible launch opportunity is still being discussed.""

The postponement of the launch, which had been set for Saturday, marks the third delay this month for the highly anticipated mission.

It would allow Nasa to certify a second commercial vehicle to carry crews to the ISS, beyond Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Earlier this month, the Starliner launch was postponed just hours before liftoff, with the astronauts already strapped in, due to a separate technical issue.

Europe's most valuable company has been hit by its second fire in a week, this time at its headquarters in Denmark.

Novo Nordisk said production of its Ozempic and Wegovy durgs had not been affected by the blaze outside a building at its site in Bagsvaerd, which then spread to an adjacent office.

A spokesman said that extinguishing the fire ""is expected to last some hours"", with about 100 firefighters at the site.

It comes a week after a fire on the roof of a factory construction site in Kalundborg, where the company is spending more than $8bn (£6.3bn) to boost production.

The decline in inflation has nothing to do with the Government, Telegraph readers have said, after the consumer prices index dropped to its lowest level in nearly three years.

Here is a selection on some of our readers' views on falling inflation and pressure from former Tory ministers for interest rate cuts.

Wholesale gas prices have jumped to their highest level in four months after a warning about possible disruption of suppky from Russia's Gazprom.

Dutch front-month futures, the continent's benchmark, rose as much as 4.4pc to more than €34 per megawatt hour.

The UK equivalent rose by as much as 4.5pc to more than 83p per therm.

It came as Austrian energy supplier OMV said an unidentified European company had won a court decision to obstruct its payments to Gazprom, potentially halting supplies.

Austrian regulators said it could lead to a ""short-term"" increase in prices.

Citi has been fined £62m by UK regulators after a ""fat finger"" trade triggered a flash crash on the European stock market.

The German economy is expected to have grown gently in the second quarter after a positive first three months of the year, the Bundesbank said.

The German central bank said in its monthly report that economic output ""is likely to increase slightly again"" during the period.

Europe's largest economy exceeded expectations in the first quarter, when it posted growth of 0.2pc.

The positive figures came as a relief after German output shrunk by 0.5pc in the last quarter of 2023 at the end of a difficult period of high inflation.

An improvement in the services sector was behind much of the rising German growth figures.

Businesses in the sector could see their ""recovery continue"", the Bundesbank said.

Oil prices have slumped towards their lowest level in three months amid signs of rising stockpiles in the US.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, has fallen 0.7pc towards $82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has dropped 0.7pc to near $78.

The American Petroleum Institute reported crude stockpiles rose by 2.5m barrels last week, according to Bloomberg.

Brent is around 7pc higher so far this year amid cuts to supply by the Opec+ cartel, but prices have cooled since mid-April.

US stock markets are on track to begin the day lower ahead of AI chip maker Nvidia's quarterly results and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes due later in the day.

All eyes will be on semiconductor bellwether Nvidia's first-quarter results, due after market close. Analysts are keen to see if it can meet the market's sky-high expectations.

Nvidia has emerged as the third-largest US company by market value after a more than 92pc surge in its shares this year and an over three-fold jump in 2023.

The company's shares were down 0.5pc in premarket trading, after rising over 3pc over the past two days.

Market participants are also keenly awaiting minutes from the US central bank's latest policy meeting for more clarity on the timing of rate cuts.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was down 0.2pc, and the Nasdaq 100 had fallen 0.2pc.

This is what Rishi Sunak has been waiting for. Not since July 2021 has Britain's inflation rate started with the number ""2"".

Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan analyses what happens next:

Read why the Bank of England could yet defy market gloom to slash borrowing costs.

Inter Milan have been taken over by US fund Oaktree after the Serie A champions' outgoing owners Suning missed a deadline to repay a €395m (£336.5m) debt.

Chinese conglomerate Suning have relinquished control of Inter to Oaktree three days after the team were officially crowned Italian champions for the 20th time.

The Culture Secretary has backed Ofcom after the regulator warned GB News that it could consider fining it or revoking its licence over recent impartiality breaches.

Lucy Frazer was grilled by MPs at the Culture, Media and Sport Committe about a recent finding by the broadcasting regulator, which found that the People's Forum: The Prime Minister broke impartiality rules.

The watchdog said it was starting the ""process for consideration of a statutory sanction against GB News"" following a ""serious and repeated breach"" of the rules and the hour-long programme where Rishi Sunak took questions from the audience.

Ms Frazer said: ""I think that Ofcom is doing its job in terms of making sure that the Broadcasting Code is complied with.""

When asked if the media regulator had been ""tolerant"" of GB News, Ms Frazer appeared to defend Ofcom saying that it has ""found various breaches"" of the channel.

""I would say Ofcom is doing its job,"" she added.

Ms Frazer also said the BBC ""has more work to do"" on impartiality.

She added: ""I do think the BBC has more work to do on impartiality and I think the BBC absolutely accepts that.""

James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said:

In corporate news, Tesla sales slumped across Europe last month as governments reduced the subsidies offered to buyers of electric cars.

Tesla registrations in Britain fell by a quarter in April and have slumped 14pc in the first four months of the year.

The carmaker registered just 13,951 vehicles in April, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said, which was down by 2.3pc from last year and its worst total since January 2023.

It comes despite chief executive Elon Musk previously insisting that he expected the car maker's second quarter results would be ""a lot better"".

Germany and Sweden have been among the major economies to have ceased or reduced subsidies for electric vehicles in recent months, which has put a damper on Europe's sales growth.

Bond markets slumped after the latest official figures showed inflation remained higher than expected in Britian.

The yield on 10-year UK gilts - which moves inversely to its price - rose by more than nine basis points to 4.22pc, which was its highest level this month.

The coupon on two-year gilts, which are more sensitive to changes in interest rates - has jumped nearly 12 basis points to 4.4pc.

The pound has hit its highest level in two months against both the dollar and the euro as money markets indicated the first interest rate cut by the Bank of England could come as late as November.

Prior to the latest official figures, which showed persistent services inflation, traders had been betting on a 50pc chance of a rate cut in June.

Former Post Office boss Paula Vennells has apologised to subpostmasters and their families as she began giving evidence to the Horizon IT inquiry.

As inflation fell to 2.3pc, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said:

Average UK house prices increased by 1.8pc in the 12 months to March, according to official figures.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it lifted the average house price across the UK to £283,000.

It represented a recovery in pricing after house prices had fallen by 0.2pc in the 12 months to February.

Meanwhile, the ONS also revealed that UK private rents increased by 8.9pc in the 12 months to April, as house price inflation slowed slightly from 9.2pc growth in the year to March.

Away from today's inflation news, BT has been fined £2.8m by the industry watchdog after EE and Plusnet failed to provide clear and simple contract information to more than a million customers before they signed up.

Ofcom said that since June 2022, BT's EE and Plusnet businesses made more than 1.3m sales without providing customers with a contract summary and information documents, which affected at least 1.1m customers.

This meant that BT broke the regulator's consumer protection rules, which came into effect in 2022 and are designed to ensure customers get clear, comparable information about the services they are considering buying.

Ofcom said the fine ""reflects the seriousness of this breach"".

Ofcom brought in the rules in June 2022 and said BT had assured it that the group was confident the deadline would be met.

But the watchdog said its investigation found that, from January 2022, BT was aware that some of its sales would not meet the deadline. Ofcom said:

A BT spokesman said: ""We're sorry that some of our pre-contract information and contract summary documents were not available to some of our customers in a timely manner. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and have taken steps to proactively contact affected customers and arrange for them to receive the information and be refunded where applicable.""

People do still feel worse off than a few years ago, Jeremy Hunt has acknowledged.

Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain, the Chancellor said:

Ministers have called for the Bank of England to cut interest rates as inflation fell to its lowest level in nearly three years.

Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Tory business secretary, said the Bank of England should have already cut interest rates, which stand at 16-year highs of 5.25pc.

Sir Jacob said: ""Interest rates ought to have been cut already as inflation is a lagging indicator.""

Mark Francois, a Tory former minister, said the Bank of England should now ""actively consider"" cutting the interest rate.

Jeremy Hunt said it was ""nothing to do with me"" when asked if he personally felt wealthier following the cost-of-living crisis.

Asked by BBC Radio 4's Today programme if he felt wealthier, the Chancellor said:

He pointed to cost-of-living support the Government had offered, adding: ""The result of those difficult decisions, and they were difficult because in the end we had to put up taxes for those decisions, but the result is living standards have gone up since Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister.""

In a testy exchange, Mr Hunt could earlier be heard to insist ""me too"" when host Emma Barnett said she was interested in people's household finances.

Although traders have reacted strongly to the latest inflation figures, many economists still think summer interest rate cuts remain a possibility.

Suren Thiru, ICAEW economics director, said: ""Lingering concerns over underlying inflationary pressures mean a June rate cut is unlikely.

""However, these figures may convince more rate setters to vote to ease policy, providing a signal that a summer rate cut is still possible.""

Julian Jessop, economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, said he believed a rate cut in June is ""still in play"".

Stepping away from inflation for a moment, Marks & Spencer has revealed a better-than-expected surge in annual profits as its turnaround pays off.

The retail bellwether reported a 58pc rise in underlying pre-tax profits to £716.4m for the year to March 30.

It notched up an 11.3pc jump in like-for-like food sales over the year, with growth of 5.2pc across its clothing and home arm.

The group said it was upping its cost-cutting target by another £100m to £500m by 2027-28 as it looks to offset rising staff wages.

The company said: ""With continuing cost headwinds, notably from investment in colleague pay, the structural cost programme is critical to our profit progression.""

It said it was in the ""strongest financial health since 1997"" and was confident of making ""further progress"" over the financial year ahead.

Its shares were last up 8.7pc - leading gains on the FTSE 100.

Stock markets have slipped after inflation fell by less than expected, delivering a blow to hopes of a June interest rate cut.

The benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 0.6pc, while the pound strengthened against the dollar and touched a two-month high at $1.275.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped 0.4pc.

It comes as markets are now pegging a mere 16pc chance of a June rate cut by the Bank of England, a dip from the nearly 60pc that was priced in last week.

Despite UK inflation edging closer to the Bank of England's target, its slowdown fell short of expectations, with services inflation proving to be persistent.

Markets also have Nvidia's quarterly results on the radar that is due later in the day, and could spark a $200bn swing in the AI-darling's shares.

In corporate news, Marks & Spencer jumped 8.7pc to the top of the FTSE 100 after the retailer reported a 58pc rise in annual profit, which was ahead of market expectations.

SSE fell 2.3pc after the power generator and network operator posted a lower annual adjusted operating profit.

Responding to the inflation figures, Rishi Sunak told reporters:

There is still ""much more to be done"" to drive down inflation, Labour's Darren Jones has said, pointing to energy measures which could prevent inflationary spikes in the UK in future.

The shadow Treasury minister acknowledged inflation had ""come down a bit"" when speaking to Sky News, but said this was ""largely driven by a drop in the energy price cap"".

He added: ""Core inflation is still around 3.6pc to 3.9pc, which is hotter than the markets were expecting it to be. This is not out of the woods yet. It is in the right direction but there is still much more to be done.""

Mr Jones pointed to Labour's ""securonomics"" agenda, which includes measures to build ""homegrown, secure, renewable energy"".

The shadow minister said:

UK stock markets declined at the open as inflation fell by less than expected at the start of the year.

The FTSE 100 began the day by falling 0.6pc to 8,363.02 while the midcap FTSE 250 was down 0.4pc to 20,701.53.

Hopes of a summer interest rate cut have been dashed for mortgage holders after inflation fell less than expected last month.

The consumer prices index tumbled from 3.2pc to 2.3pc in April - its lowest level in nearly three years - after a record decline in energy prices.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the sharp decline indicated that ""brighter days are ahead"" but economists had expected inflation to drop to 2.1pc.

As a result, traders have pushed back their expectations for interest rate cuts from as early as June to as late as November.

They are also only pricing in one interest rate cut this year, compared to two before the latest inflation figures were published.

Services inflation, a critical indicator for Bank of England policymakers, dipped slightly from 6pc in March to 5.9pc in April in a blow to hopes for early rate cuts.

The figure was higher than forecasts of a drop to 5.4pc, driven by more volatile aspects of the sector, such as hotels and live music.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, fell from 4.2pc to 3.9pc, which was higher than predictions of a drop to 3.6pc.

The weaker than expected decline in inflation was another example of inflation figures ""developing a nasty habit of coming in hot"", according to analysts.

Rob Morgan, chief investment analyst at Charles Stanley, said

Public borrowing has overshot forecasts in April, leaving Jeremy Hunt with less room to cut taxes this year in a pre-election giveaway.

The deficit stood at £20.5bn in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This is £1.2bn more than the £19.3bn forecast just two months ago by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's tax and spending watchdog.

Public borrowing in the tax year ending in March has also been revised higher by £0.8bn to £121.4bn, outpacing forecasts by the Government's spending watchdog by £7.3bn.

The figures are a blow to Conservative Party's prospects of narrowing a 27-point poll gap with Labour by wooing voters with further reductions in national insurance.

While public sector receipts from income like taxation was £1.6bn higher in April than a year earlier, spending has grown at nearly twice the pace at £3.1bn.

Alex Kerr at Capital Economics said: ""The Chancellor will be disappointed that April's figures do not provide more scope for tax cuts at a fiscal event later this year.

""Moreover, we expect slower wage growth to dampen tax receipts growth later this year. And the rise in market interest rates since March's Budget alone suggests he may have even less fiscal headroom (perhaps about £6.5bn) for tax cuts than the £8.9bn left over in March.""

Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, added: ""The headroom to cut taxes doesn't exist, but Chancellor Hunt seems likely to go ahead anyway.""

It comes after inflation figures for April were higher than expected, pushing back market expectations of the first interest rate cut.

The sharp decline in inflation takes the consumer prices index closer to the Bank of England's 2pc target but may not be enough to trigger an early interest rate cut by its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), according to economists.

Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said:

Other economists also signalled their disappointment with the figures:

The pound has risen after the sharp decline in inflation was still higher than analysts had expected.

Sterling rose 0.3pc against the dollar to $1.275 - its highest level since March - after the consumer prices index dropped to 2.3pc in April, which was higher than forecasts of a fall to 2.1pc.

The pound was up 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth a little over 85p.

Inflation is ""back to normal"" and ""brighter days are ahead"", Rishi Sunak has said in response to the latest figures.

The Prime Minister said:

The Office for National Statistics has also published borrowing figures this morning, showing that the Government borrowed £20.5bn last month, which was higher than official forecasts.

The dramatic fall in inflation was mainly driven by the lowering of the Ofgem price cap in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

It meant that average household energy bills fell by £238 a year to £1,690 following the shock caused by Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.

The ONS said prices of electricity, gas and other fuels fell by 27.1pc in the year to April, the largest fall on record.

Gas prices fell by 37.5pc on the year, compared with a fall of 26.5pc in the year to March 2024, while electricity prices fell by 21pc, compared with 13pc in March.

Inflation has fallen less than expected, official figures show, in a blow for the Prime Minister and mortgage holders.

The consumer prices index dropped in April from 3.2pc to 2.3pc following a record decline in typical energy bills last month, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The drop takes the pace of price growth to its lowest level since July 2021 but it was far short of analyst expectations of a plunge to 2.1pc.

The higher-than-expected reading could derail hopes for a summer cut to interest rates, which would provide relief to mortgage holders grappling with the highest borrowing costs in 16 years.

It is also a blow to Rishi Sunak, who has said he only wants to call a general election when people ""feel that things are improving"".

Derivatives trades on money markets had indicated the Bank of England would reduce borrowing costs twice by the end of the year from 16-year highs of 5.25pc to 4.75pc.

Traders had priced in a first cut by August and more than a 50pc chance of a first cut in June.

Thanks for joining me. We begin the day with the economic news that has been keenly anticipated by mortgage holders and the Prime Minister.

Inflation fell to 2.3pc in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, raising hopes that interest rate cuts will not be far away.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) will purchase the stake in the Area 4 concession from Galp Energia SGPS SA, it said in a statement Wednesday. Galp will receive $650 million, and further contingent payments of as much as $500 million when two planned development phases go ahead, the Portugese company said in a separate statement.

The agreement gives ADNOC a share of liquified natural gas (LNG) supply, a fuel that it's betting on for future growth. The company is also scouring the world for deals, including the takeover of German chemical company Covestro AG and the merger of one of its units with a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

In Mozambique, ADNOC will get a share in the 3.5 million-ton-a-year Coral South development LNG export project that is currently in operation. A proposed expansion called Coral North could produce the same amount of fuel from a floating export vessel. Another project planned to be based onshore called Rovuma is projected to have capacity to produce 18 million tons of LNG a year.

It follows ADNOC's first acquisition in the U.S. earlier this week when it picked up a share in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG project in Texas, along with supply from a planned expansion of the plant.

The deal into Mozambique -- where attacks by militant groups linked with Islamic State have ramped up near the project site -- is also the latest example of the UAE's move to boost its influence in Africa. Earlier this year, the country agreed to invest $35 billion in Egypt, potentially saving the economy.

In 2022, the UAE pledged $52.8 billion in foreign direct investments in Africa, when it first topped FDI rankings, according to data from fDi Markets. That figure fell to $44.5 billion in 2023 -- still nearly twice that of Beijing, which came in second.

Oil wealth. The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn ADNOC into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

""We've made it very clear that we're interested in key sectors when it comes to low carbon solutions, renewables, natural gas and chemicals,"" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth, said in an interview Monday after the company announced the US deal. ""We're executing on our strategy and our strategy is clear. It's a milestone with hopefully more to come.""

ADNOC will take Galp's place in the Rovuma and Coral projects. The company will join Eni SpA, Exxon Mobil Corp., China National Petroleum Corp., Korea Gas Corp. and Mozambique's state producer Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos E.P.

Mozambique's Area 4 includes Eni's $7 billion floating Coral South Project that began shipping LNG in 2022 and a similar planned offshore production facility. Exxon said earlier this month that it expects a final investment decision for the onshore Rovuma project by the end of 2025.",worldoil.com,news,World Oil,,0.3176470588235294,454089853,1,https://www.worldoil.com/media/xdonqoqc/411923697.jpg,eng-9589168

UK Winter-24 gas is now trading above £1/therm, a level last seen towards the back end of 2023.

Reasons for continued support in the market include increasing Asian LNG demand due to the onset of a heatwave as well restocking ahead of the summer, whilst disruptions at facilities in Malaysia and Australia are tightening the supply picture. Asian spot LNG prices rose to the highest since late-December. However, with prices this high, alternatives are now more cost-effective in emerging markets, casting doubt on demand levels. Elsewhere in the US, market participants were also pricing in a delay in the Exxon Mobil/QatarEnergies' Golden Pass LNG export plant in Texas when their contractor filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday which could delay the project.

Traders also remain alert to potential supply interruptions as geopolitical tensions simmer. Earlier today Austrian oil and gas group OMV said that gas supplies from Russia's Gazprom may be suspended in connection with a foreign court ruling, without identifying the case. Gazprom has typically shipped around 40 million cubic metres of gas a day via Ukraine transit routes in 2024 with around half of this gas going to Austria via pipelines through Ukraine and then Slovakia. Although OMV said it will be able to supply its contractual customers with gas from alternative sources because it had diversified its supply base with other origins, such as Norway, and with LNG from the world market, the market remains spooked.

If Austrian courts enforce the decision, potentially disrupting OMV (OTCPK:OMVJF) payments, it is ""likely that Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas,"" the company said.

An interruption to Russian supplies could lead to a ""short-term"" increase in prices, although alternatives and high storage levels should ensure adequate supply into 2026, Austrian regulator E-Control said.

Most Russian westward gas exports were halted in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and the disruption has triggered a series of legal disputes.

Former Gazprom (OTCPK:GZPFY) customers have filed claims against the Russian company, including in Finland, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic; Bulgaria said this week it is pursuing €400M in compensation.

Austria has been locked into gas supply agreements first signed more than 50 years ago with the Soviet Union.

The Vienna-based company said that an undisclosed European energy company has secured a suspension order.

If the order is implemented in Austria against OMV subsidiary OMV Gas Marketing & Trading (OGMT), it would be required make payments to the unnamed European energy company instead of Gazprom for the gas supply contracts.

""In case of such an enforcement, OGMT considers it likely that Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas under the gas supply contract with OGMT, thereby affecting the Austrian gas market,"" OMV said.

However, it is not aware when such enforcement could occur.

The cessation of most Russian gas exports to the West occurred after the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, leading to severed ties and sanctions against Russian energy shipments.

Despite the potential supply issues, OMV has said that it can provide gas to its customers from alternative sources, including Norway and liquified natural gas from the global market.

Austria's energy regulator E-Control, as reported by Reuters, has acknowledged the potential Gazprom suspension in its supply scenarios for the winters of 2024/25 and 2025/26.

E-Control also noted that a disruption in Russian gas could temporarily drive up prices.

Separately, Reuters, citing TASS, reported that a Russian court has prohibited OMV from initiating arbitration against Gazprom outside of Russia.

The Court of Arbitration of St Petersburg and the Leningrad Region has also threatened OMV with a fine of €575.2m ($623.3m) if it proceeds with arbitration in foreign courts.

ST. PETERSBURG, May 22. /TASS/. The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region upheld Gazprom Export's claim against Austria's OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH banning it from continuing foreign arbitration proceedings, a TASS correspondent reported from the courtroom.

The court ruled that the Austrian company will have to pay Gazprom Export if it violates the ban.

""The Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region determined: to prohibit the company OMF Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce <...>. In case the company OMF Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH fails to comply with the ruling of the Arbitration Court of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region <...> an award in favor of Gazprom Export LLC [in the amount of] 575,266,000 euros in rubles at the rate of the Bank of Russia will be paid,"" the judge said.

Earlier, Gazprom Export demanded that OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH be prohibited from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and that it be fined if it failed to comply with the judicial act.

Gazprom Export's lawyer insisted in court that because of sanctions, the company can not get proper legal representation and justice abroad. In particular, a number of EU law firms refused to work with Russian companies, and an agreement on streamlining the issuance of visas was also canceled. Nevertheless, the OMV representative claimed that no personal sanctions had been imposed against Gazprom Export, and the Austrian company proposed - within the same arbitration court - to transfer the hearings to other jurisdictions (including Dubai or Istanbul), but did not receive any response.

OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH is a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG. In June 2018, an agreement was signed to extend the existing contract between Gazprom Export LLC and OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH to supply Russian natural gas to Austria until 2040. Previously, the contract was signed through 2028.

Earlier Gazprom filed claims in the Russian court against German traders Uniper Global Commodities SE and Meta-Methanhandel GmbH, Austria's OMV Exploration & Production GmbH, Czech company NET4GAS, Naftogaz of Ukraine, the Dutch gas transport Gasunie Transport Service, the operator of the BBL gas pipeline between the UK and the Netherlands, Slovakia's ZSE Energia and the Polish-Russian company Europol GAZ, which owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, demanding a ban on continuing arbitration proceedings in foreign courts. The Russian company won all its claims to ban the continuation of legal proceedings abroad.

Gazprom Export also filed a similar lawsuit against Czech company CEZ, with a hearing scheduled for May 24.",tass.com,news,TASS,,-0.09019607843137256,454081257,25,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,eng-9589934

OMV's unit OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH (OGMT) has learned about a foreign court decision obtained by a major European energy company which, if enforced in Austria against OGMT, would require OGMT to make payments under its gas supply contract with Gazprom Export to such European energy company, instead of Gazprom Export.

OMV's subsidiary doesn't know if and when such an enforcement might occur, the company said, without specifying the case or the European company in question.

""In case of such an enforcement, OGMT considers it likely that Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas under the gas supply contract with OGMT, thereby affecting the Austrian gas market. This assessment is based on Gazprom Export's conduct in similar situations,"" OMV said in its message to the market.

The Austrian company assured the market that OGMT ""would still be able to supply its contractual customers with gas from alternative, non-Russian sources, through its extensive diversification efforts over the last several years.""

The urgent market message from OMV highlights the vulnerability of Austria's gas supply, which is still dependent on Russia's Gazprom.

While Gazprom suspended gas supply to many EU countries in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, Austria and several other central European countries continue to receive gas from Russia.

Earlier this year, Austria, one of the EU members still most dependent on Russian gas, signaled it would be looking to reduce its dependence on Moscow, including by seeking to end a long-term deal that OMV has with Gazprom.

Russian gas deliveries to Europe have fallen off a cliff since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but some European customers in central Europe continue to receive Russian gas via the route through Ukraine and a pipeline via Turkey.

Ukraine has already signaled it would not engage in talks with Russia about an extension of the gas transit deal which expires at the end of 2024.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,,0.07450980392156858,454081169,29,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/news/718x300/2024-05-22_agu9npi4qa.jpg,eng-9589934

The Romanian capital market has seen stellar growth over the past 15 years since we began investing directly via our funds in local companies. As of May 29th, we will further invigorate this vibrant market by providing an accessible way for the retail investors to gain fast and accessible exposure to the most liquid and dynamic companies. Moreover, we are proud that this ETF is the first on the Bucharest Stock Exchange that is also tradable on other exchanges, in Zagreb and Ljubljana, thereby fulfilling our promise to promote the Romanian capital market internationally,"" stated Ivan Kurtovic, Chairman of the Management Board at InterCapital Asset Management.

The new ETF will track the performance of the BET-TRN index, which includes 20 Romanian blue-chip companies such as Banca Transilvania, Hidroelectrica, OMV Petrom, and DIGI Communications. BET-TRN stands for ""Total Return Net,"" meaning the index reflects not only the price movements of the blue-chips but also assumes that net dividends are reinvested. Consequently, dividends received will be automatically reinvested in the stocks that paid them. The price of one fund unit on the first day of trading, May 29th, will be around 70 lei, offering an affordable way to gain exposure to the BET index. For comparison, the estimated cost of replicating the BET index by a retail investor is approximately RON 21,500, excluding trading fees.

Mihaela Bîciu, CEO of Investimental, commented: ""We are excited to bring the InterCapital BET-TRN UCITS ETF to Romanian investors, allowing for an even greater participation of individual investors in the local capital market. This ETF offers an incredibly affordable way for the general public to invest in top Romanian companies, with a fund unit being available for less than 100 lei each. Thanks to the competitive pricing, it is currently the most cost-effective method for individuals to gain exposure to our thriving capital market, and the reinvestment of dividends directly enhances the growth potential of their investment. This makes it an effortless and efficient wealth accumulation tool for everyone, regardless of their investment experience. We believe this ETF is a significant step in making the benefits of the stock market accessible to all and we look forward to being able to offer it for all investors starting with May 29th, 2024.""

With the launch of the new ETF, Investimental, the Market Maker for the ETF, will offer clients a lowered trading fee for an undetermined period. Thus, Investors will be able to buy the ETF paying a reduced trading commission of 0.26%, in addition to the standard ASF commission of 0.04%. With a total commission of 0.3%, purchasing BET-TRN UCITS via Investimental will be thus the cheapest way for the public to gain exposure to the Romanian capital markets. The investors will be able to buy fund units in the BET-TRN UCITS via all intermediaries that are authorized on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, at standard fees.

Separate to the trading fee applicable upon purchasing the fund units, InterCapital will also apply management cost of 0.6%, giving a total expense ratio of below 1% annually. Keeping costs low ensures that investors effectively benefit from market performance, maximizing the growth potential of their investments.

The current assets under management of the ETF that tracks BET-TRN have surpassed 8 million euros since InterCapital Asset Management has already launched the ETF on the BET-TRN index in the region, with the ETF being traded in euros on the Zagreb Stock Exchange since May 31st, 2023, and on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange since January 23rd, 2024. InterCapital expects that the assets under management will exceed 30 million euros by the end of 2024, driven by both local and international demand.

Since the beginning of 2024, the BET-TRN index has registered a 16.45% increase, outperforming the S&P 500 and STOXX Europe 600, driven by strong performances from both defensive stocks and entrepreneurial companies included in the BET index.",business-review.eu,news,Business Review,Miruna Macsim,0.3490196078431373,454075484,1,https://business-review.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BeFunky-collage-89-scaled.jpg,eng-9589119

The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub was up 0.98 euro at 33.90 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) by 11.16 GMT, according to LSEG data.

The contract earlier hit an intra-day high of 34.11 euros/MWh, its highest level since January.

In the British market, the front-month contract was 2.85 pence higher at 82.20 p/therm.

""Given the expiry of the transit deal and potential for disruption to LNG supplies it feels very much like the market is taking a risk-off approach,"" he said.

Austrian oil and gas group OMV said on Wednesday that gas supplies from Russia's Gazprom may be suspended in connection with a foreign court ruling, without identifying the case.

Gazprom has typically shipped around 40 million cubic metres (mcm) of gas a day via Ukraine transit routes in 2024 with around half of this gas going to Austria via pipelines through Ukraine and then Slovakia.

LSEG analyst Tomasz Marcin Kowalski said the market was also watching news that the lead contractor, who is building a Texas liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant for QatarEnergy and Exxon Mobil, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, citing challenges at the project.

""Market participants may see this as a potential risk for delaying the ongoing LNG export project in Texas, as Europe is much more reliant on LNG supplies,"" he said.

The rise in prices came against a backdrop of higher supply from Norway as maintenance eased.

""On the positive side, some of the Norwegian assets are back online which has increased the output considerably compared to yesterday,"" analysts at Auxilione said in a daily research note.

Flows began ramping up from Norway's Kollsnes processing plant with total Norwegian exports to the UK up by 24 million cubic metres a day (mcm/d) to 60 mcm/d LSEG data showed.

A failure to pay the Kremlin-controlled gas giant on time would likely interrupt supplies, OMV said late Tuesday in a so-called urgent market message. Gazprom has covered more than 80% of Austrian imports over the last seven months under a long-term contract running until 2040.

The warning stems from a ""foreign court decision obtained by a major European energy company,"" OMV wrote in a statement. Should Austrian courts enforce the decision, potentially disrupting OMV payments, it's ""likely that Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas,"" it said.

OMV said its doesn't know whether or when such an enforcement might happen.

An interruption to Russian supplies could lead to a ""short-term"" increase in prices, Austrian regulator E-Control said Wednesday in a statement. However, adequate alternatives and high storage levels mean the country should have adequate supply into 2026.

E-Control and an OMV spokesman declined to identify the company or court case that triggered the warning. The Ministry of Energy didn't return requests for comment.

Former Gazprom customers have filed claims against the Russian company, including in Finland, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic. On Tuesday, Bulgaria announced it's pursuing €400 million ($434 million) compensation.

The new OMV warning was issued as Austria reviews its contract with Gazprom. Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler has sought to accelerate the country's pivot away from Russian supplies ahead of national elections later this year.

A failure to pay the Kremlin-controlled gas giant on time would likely interrupt supplies, OMV said late Tuesday in a so-called urgent market message. Gazprom has covered more than 80% of Austrian imports over the last seven months under a long-term contract running until 2040.

The warning stems from a ""foreign court decision obtained by a major European energy company,"" OMV wrote in a statement. Should Austrian courts enforce the decision, potentially disrupting OMV payments, it's ""likely that Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas,"" it said.

OMV said its doesn't know whether or when such an enforcement might happen.

An interruption to Russian supplies could lead to a ""short-term"" increase in prices, Austrian regulator E-Control said Wednesday in a statement. However, adequate alternatives and high storage levels mean the country should have adequate supply into 2026.

E-Control and an OMV spokesman declined to identify the company or court case that triggered the warning. The Ministry of Energy didn't return requests for comment.

Former Gazprom customers have filed claims against the Russian company, including in Finland, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic. On Tuesday, Bulgaria announced it's pursuing €400 million ($434 million) compensation.

The new OMV warning was issued as Austria reviews its contract with Gazprom. Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler has sought to accelerate the country's pivot away from Russian supplies ahead of national elections later this year.

And two years on Jenna Robinson and Zoe Clifton are more in love than ever and are the only couple from their series still together.

The two found love on the hit dating show, which sees couples matched up by psychologists as they meet for the very first time at the altar and say 'I do'.

And with Jenna and Zoe the experts got the match right and while their marriage on the show wasn't legally binding, the pair are planning on doing it for real as they gushed their love story is 'a lesbian fairytale come true'.

Speaking to The Guardian, Jenna exclaimed: 'How lucky are we that this worked out? When we've got a family, we can show our kids the moment our eyed first met. It's absolutely wild.'

The pair were the first lesbian relationship to feature on the show, and Zoe opened up about how it added an underlying amount of pressure on their relationship.

She explained: 'You feel an obligation to represent and I wasn't sure how. Later, I realised that just showing a healthy respectful lesbian relationship on TV is enough.'

Zoe added that the pair received so many messages from mums saying it had helped them understand what their daughters were going through.

Since the show finished their relationship has gone from strength to strength as Jenna added: 'It's a lesbian fairytale come true'.

Last month marked the couple's two tear anniversary, as Jenna took to Instagram with a sweet tribute post as she shared a snap of them kissing at the altar the first time they met.

Pairing it with a snap of the two of them now, she wrote: 'then -> now. The most amazing 2 years with the most amazing wife @zoeclifton xxx'.

Meanwhile Zoe also celebrated the milestone with a selection of snaps of the pair together as she penned: 'My love... What a bloody adventure we've been on... A very happy anniversary to my beautiful @jennarobo'.

During the show, the pair weren't without their differences and Zoe's love of meat was a cause of contention with vegan Jenna.

Talking about the clash, Jenna admitted they focused on that storyline on the show for some drama but now the pair love each other's contrasts and are always learning from each other.

In January 2023, Zoe even did veganuary in support of her wife as she shocked fans with the revelation but revealed she hoped to push through with Jenna's help.

She captioned the post: 'CAUTION- you may pass out from shock when you read this!

'As you guys know, I LOVE my meat, so feeling a little apprehensive... but I'm hoping that with Jenna's help and the new OMV! and Plant Based by Asda ranges it should be a walk in the park (she says...)

'I'm really going to need your support here guys! Let's all take a moment to pray for me.

'I'll be posting regular updates, so stay tuned to see how I get on!'

Jenna's veganism caused a row on the show, after she confessed her lifestyle choice to Zoe.

Their frank exchange of views occurred on their honeymoon after Jenna admitted she would prefer her wife not to eat reindeer after seeing it as an option on their food menu.

However in the reunion episode which went out in October 2022, Zoe and Jenna were revealed to be the only couple still together.

Zoe said at the reunion: 'You tick so many of the boxes that I asked for. You're thoughtful, ambitious, intelligent,' Jenna replied: 'I feel emotional, I'm happy for us both that we're together'

Jenna and Zoe had the group rejoicing as they arrived at the dinner hand in hand, gushing: 'It's really nice walking in as a couple because I think it proves that the experiment works.'

'Since leaving the experiment, me and Zoe have really made an effort with each other.

'We've made time for each other, even though we both have really busy lives,' Jenna told the camera.

Later at the dinner party, the couple shared an emotional moment as Zoe told her tearful wife: 'I'm just happy we made it to this moment.'

'To come back together when you can see how many times other people have tried and it hasn't worked out.'

'I'm really proud of us,' Jenna agreed.

May 22 (Interfax) - The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region upheld an application from Gazprom Export LLC at a hearing on Wednesday to prohibit OMV Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from continuing arbitration proceedings at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

""[The Court] upholds the application (complaint),"" the arbitration file says.

Gazprom Export also asked the court to order the recovery of funds from OMV in case of failure to comply with the judicial act.

Russian courts have already issued several bans on foreign counterparties conducting proceedings in foreign courts and arbitration institutions, companies belonging to Gazprom said.

The sanctions imposed by the European Union include, in part, a ban on the provision of legal services to Russian legal entities. According to the Russian side, this makes fair consideration of disputes in courts in unfriendly jurisdictions impossible.

The Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region, after a claim by Gazprom, prohibited OMV Exploration & Production GmbH in April from continuing proceedings in the International Arbitration Court of the International Chamber of Commerce with a monetary sanction awarded in case of failure to comply with the ban.

Designed as a smart and sustainable residential complex, complying with current nZEB standards, the project is developed in four phases, with a total of 500 units and a total investment of 60 million euros.

Phase III of The Level Apartments project, located in northern Bucharest near OMV-Petrom headquarters, will encompass a built-up area of approximately 10,000 square meters. By the end of 2025, the project will provide an additional 105 apartments, ranging from studios, two-bedroom, three-bedroom to four-bedroom units, as a first for the project. Over 70% of these apartments have already been pre-contracted. The complex will feature 136 parking spaces, both underground and above-ground, along with over 300 square meters of commercial and service area which will serve both future residents and neighborhood inhabitants.

""Following the great success of the first two phases, we decided to accelerate our development plans at Redport Capital. This ambitious project, initiated in 2017, reflects the company's unwavering belief in the potential of the Dămăroaia-Străulești area. With the completion of the first phase, the area has emerged as a major point of interest for residential development in Bucharest. The success achieved with Level I and Level II confirms the appreciation for our high-quality standards and competitive pricing. The Level Apartments III marks a new chapter in the project's story, incorporating significant technological improvements and reinforcing the company's commitment to sustainability while providing convenient access to modern amenities,"" stated Cosmin Savu - Cristescu, CEO of Redport Capital.

The investment value for Phase III of The Level Apartments project exceeds 13 million euros. The financing will be a combination of equity capital and bank financing secured from First Bank. First Bank's contribution amounts to 8.7 million euros, including a 1 million euro VAT credit line.

""We have chosen to collaborate with First Bank due to the strong and trustworthy relationship we have built together. We are delighted by the bank's openness and willingness to support us in developing The Level Apartments project. This close and transparent collaboration underscores our commitment to the project's success and strengthens our confidence to continue developing for the future of the community,"" stated Oriol Casellas - Deig, CFO of Redport Capital.

Driven by strong customer demand, Redport Capital is actively pursuing the necessary documentation to obtain the building permit for Phase IV of The Level Apartments project, with the aim of starting construction in the latter part of this year.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will purchase the stake in the Area 4 concession from Galp Energia SGPS SA, it said in a statement Wednesday. Galp will receive $650 million, and further contingent payments of as much as $500 million when two planned development phases go ahead, the Portugese company said in a separate statement.

The agreement gives Adnoc a share of LNG supply, a fuel that it's betting on for future growth. The company is also scouring the world for deals, including the takeover of German chemical company Covestro AG and the merger of one of its units with a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

In Mozambique, Adnoc will get a share in the 3.5 million-ton-a-year Coral South development LNG export project that is currently in operation. A proposed expansion called Coral North could produce the same amount of fuel from a floating export vessel. Another project planned to be based onshore called Rovuma is projected to have capacity to produce 18 million tons of LNG a year.

It follows Adnoc's first acquisition in the US earlier this week when it picked up a share in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG project in Texas, along with supply from a planned expansion of the plant.

The deal into Mozambique -- where attacks by militant groups linked with Islamic State have ramped up near the project site -- is also the latest example of the UAE's move to boost its influence in Africa. Earlier this year, the country agreed to invest $35 billion in Egypt, potentially saving the economy.

In 2022, the UAE pledged $52.8 billion in foreign direct investments in Africa, when it first topped FDI rankings, according to data from fDi Markets. That figure fell to $44.5 billion in 2023 -- still nearly twice that of Beijing, which came in second.

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

""We've made it very clear that we're interested in key sectors when it comes to low carbon solutions, renewables, natural gas and chemicals,"" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth, said in an interview Monday after the company announced the US deal. ""We're executing on our strategy and our strategy is clear. It's a milestone with hopefully more to come.""

Adnoc will take Galp's place in the Rovuma and Coral projects. The company will join Eni SpA, Exxon Mobil Corp., China National Petroleum Corp., Korea Gas Corp. and Mozambique's state producer Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos E.P.

The agreement gives Adnoc a share of LNG supply, a fuel that it's betting on for future growth. The company is also scouring the world for deals, including the takeover of German chemical company Covestro AG and the merger of one of its units with a subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

In Mozambique, Adnoc will get a share in the 3.5 million-ton-a-year Coral South development LNG export project that is currently in operation. A proposed expansion called Coral North could produce the same amount of fuel from a floating export vessel. Another project planned to be based onshore called Rovuma is projected to have capacity to produce 18 million tons of LNG a year.

It follows Adnoc's first acquisition in the US earlier this week when it picked up a share in NextDecade Corp.'s LNG project in Texas, along with supply from a planned expansion of the plant.

The deal into Mozambique -- where attacks by militant groups linked with Islamic State have ramped up near the project site -- is also the latest example of the UAE's move to boost its influence in Africa.

OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH (OGMT) has learned about a foreign court decision obtained by a major European energy company which, if enforced in Austria against OGMT, would require OGMT to make payments under its gas supply contract with Gazprom Export to such European energy company (instead of Gazprom Export). In this respect, it is currently not known to OGMT whether and when such an enforcement might occur.

In case of such an enforcement, OGMT considers it likely that Gazprom Export will halt supplying gas under the gas supply contract with OGMT, thereby affecting the Austrian gas market. This assessment is based on Gazprom Export's conduct in similar situations.

In the case of such a scenario, OGMT would still be able to supply its contractual customers with gas from alternative, non-Russian sources, through its extensive diversification efforts over the last several years.

OMV sources natural gas from its own production facilities in Norway and Austria, as well as from international natural gas producers. It also has long-term LNG supply contracts, which are imported into Europe via OMV's LNG regasification capacities at the GATE terminal in Rotterdam. OMV also participates as a potential buyer in the auctions of the EU's common gas purchasing platform (""EU Energy Platform""). In addition, OMV has access to all major central and north-west European gas trading and capacity marketplaces and has the corresponding transport capacities.

At OMV, we are re-inventing essentials for sustainable living. OMV is transitioning to become a leading sustainable fuels, chemicals and materials company with a focus on circular economy solutions, while operating today across three integrated business segments of Energy, Fuels & Feedstock, and Chemicals & Materials. By gradually switching over to low-carbon businesses, OMV is striving to achieve net zero by latest 2050. The company achieved revenues of EUR 39 billion in 2023 with a diverse and talented workforce of around 20,600 employees worldwide.

State Rep. Chuck Owen pushed two bills concerning the Office of Motor Vehicles through both chambers; two bills he thinks will greatly come to the aid of all Louisiana drivers.

He believes HB683 will be very impactful.

""The one we got across the line today is very, very significant because in Louisiana your insurance expires and they send you a notice and it gets to a certain point or debt level and it falls into the Office of Debt Recovery where enormous fees build up. The incoming commissioner tells me we have over 500,000 canceled drivers licenses in Louisiana. We have almost a half billion dollars in debt,"" Owen said.

According to Owen, most Louisiana citizens can't pay the fines, but HB683 moves everything back into the OMV where the new commissioner is willing to negotiate the fees downward.

Also, on Monday, state Rep. Steven Jackson of Shreveport discussed his bill -- HB295 -- which would create a public/private partnership along the Interstate 20 corridor, hoping to duplicate an entertainment area like the one in Memphis.

""We have places in this corridor that have seen success already -- Up For Brunch, Eleven Events, the Louisiana Daiquiri Café, West End Throttle -- and what those entrepreneurs in that area would like to see is an area similar to Beale Street, similar to Austin, Texas,"" Jackson said.

Jackson says there is also an opportunity for youth sports to thrive along the I-20 corridor.

We also heard from state Sen. Cleo Fields, who plans to run in the newly approved Louisiana 6th Congressional District, and state Sen. Thomas Pressly on SB133, which would prohibit international organizations like the World Health Organization or United Nations from grabbing a foothold in Louisiana.

Mediators of virulence and antibiotic resistance,"Sammanfattning: Outer membrane vesicles (OMV) have the size of nanoparticles and are released from the outer membrane of most Gram-negative bacteria. The OMV reflect the composition of the bacterial outer membrane, including lipids and virulence factors specific for the pathogen, and are involved in pathogenesis and bacterial survival. Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae are Gram-negative bacterial species that cause respiratory tract infections such as acute otitis media and exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this thesis was to investigate what role OMV derived from respiratory pathogens such as M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae plays in immune activation and evasion, as well as how the OMV interact with other pathogens of the same colonization niche.

In our first study, we determined the protemoic composition of M. catarrhalis OMV, and found them to be composed of mainly outer membrane and periplasmic proteins. We also established that OMV bind to and activate respiratory epithelial cells and cause a pro-inflammatory response both in vitro and in vivo.

Considering that more than 97% of all M. catarrhalis strains are positive for β-lactamase, we determined in our second study that OMV from this pathogen contain β-lactamase. We further showed that OMV rescued other amoxicillin susceptible co-pathogens such as non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) and Streptococcus pneumoniae from killing. Thereafter, we established in our third study that serum from healthy adults contain anti-Moraxella β-lactamase antibodies. We showed that these antibodies bind to and neutralize β-lactamase in OMV to a certain degree, whereas OMV also act as protective vesicles, shielding the enzyme in the extracellular space.

Finally, in the last study we investigated the role of OMV in co-infections with other species dwelling in the respiratory tract. Previous studies have shown treatment failures of group A streptococci (GAS) in pharyngotonsillits even though the GAS are completely susceptible to β-lactams, and that NTHi and M. catarrhalis are often found associated with GAS during treatment failures. We found that OMV from β-lactamase positive NTHi and M. catarrhalis protect GAS from amoxicillin-induced killing, and we suggest OMV secretion to be a mechanism for bacteria in polymicrobial infections to interact and protect each other.

In summary, we determined that OMV secreted from Gram-negative bacteria of the upper respiratory tract are mediators of virulence and antibiotic resistance, interacting with host cells as well as other bacterial species found in polymicrobial infections.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.1215686274509804,453997604,52,,

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will take an 11.7% stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande LNG project, according to a statement Monday. The deal will also give Adnoc 1.9 million tons a year of liquefied natural gas supply from the planned Train 4. NextDecade shares gained as much as 16% in New York trading.

Houston-based NextDecade still needs to secure sales contracts to carry out its planned expansion beyond phase 1 and to help it raise financing. The Adnoc deal is ""a major step forward"" in the probable decision to go ahead with Train 4 and in potential for rising profit from the expansion, according to analysts at Stifel.

The transaction is a significant move into the US for Adnoc and part of an international expansion plan announced in November 2022. The company has been scouring the world for assets to reach new markets. It's in talks to buy a chemical company in Europe and is also looking to combine one of its units with subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

""We've made it very clear that we're interested in key sectors when it comes to low carbon solutions, renewables, natural gas and chemicals,"" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth, said in an interview. ""We're executing on our strategy and our strategy is clear. It's a milestone with hopefully more to come.""

Adnoc's stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande project will give it access to the first three trains, as production units at LNG facilities are known. Trains 1 to 3 will have a capacity of 17.61 million tons a year, with construction already under way on the first line. Adnoc purchased its stake in the project from Global Infrastructure Partners.

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

France's TotalEnergies SE and Mubadala Development Co., an Abu Dhabi government-owned investment fund, are both shareholders in NextDecade. Total holds about 17.4% in the Houston-based developer and Mubadala owns about 5.5%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The French energy giant also holds a stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande project, along with NextDecade, GIP and, now, Adnoc.

NextDecade plans to make the final investment decision on building Train 4 in the second half of 2024. It already has a license to proceed and so shouldn't be delayed by the Biden administration's decision to put new LNG export project approvals on hold. Adnoc also has an option to take an equity stake in the planned Trains 4 and 5 at the Rio Grande project.

China's imports of Australian coal rise to nearly 4-year high in April (20)

China's coal imports from Australia rose in April to their highest since July 2020, Reuters records and customs data showed on Monday, because of improving trade relations and better price and quality.

The country imported 7.19 million metric tons of Australian coal last month, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. That represents a 25% increase from the same month of 2019, before a years-long unofficial ban on Australian coal imports.

Australian coal exports to China have been recovering since February 2023, when China ended the ban in place since 2020, after trade relations improved between the two countries.

Further, domestic coal prices in China started to pick up in April after months in the doldrums, said analysts at Galaxy Futures.

With domestic supply tightening, coastal power plants and steel mills took advantage of the improving import arbitrage to buy Australian coal, whose quality is generally higher than material from top supplier Indonesia, they said.

Australian exporters have also benefited from a free trade agreement that allows Australian coal to enter China tariff-free.

China reinstated a 3%-6% import tariff at the beginning of the year on countries without an agreement, applying to Russian and Mongolian coal imports.

The country also increased coal imports from sanction-hit Russia and neighbouring Mongolia last month, the data showed, to make up for domestic production cuts.

Russian coal imports ticked up 5% year-on-year to 8.49 million tons, despite sanctions affecting major Russian coal traders. The increase came mostly from coking coal imports, which rose by 18%.

China's total coal imports increased 11% in April to 45.25 million tons as domestic production failed to meet demand.

Safety inspections have curbed production in the main coking coal producing hub of Shanxi, where output dipped by 18.9% in the first quarter of the year.

Imports from Mongolia, mostly coking coal, also helped fill the gap, rising by 33% last month to 7.2 million tons.

In Spain, the social network caused a sensation for several years and listen ""Tuenti photo!"" It became commonplace at a time when photos were taken with a digital camera and we were not permanently connected to the Internet.

Tuenti was a place where we went to see the photos that our friends and acquaintances shared after every Saturday. It was a place we entered to see what people we knew had been up to, an unfiltered circle in which appearances didn't matter and where the usual thing was to share dozens of photos of the same event instead of a retouched photo with our best pose.

Despite its popularity among the young public in our country, Tuenti did not last long as a social network. In summer 2010, Telefónica took over a majority share of Tuenti and took advantage of the pull of the social network to launch Tu, a virtual mobile operator.

The OMV was renamed Tuenti Móvil shortly after, although it ultimately remained simply .Tuenti. Just a few years after the majority acquisition of Tuenti by Telefónica, the company absorbed 100% of the company.

At the beginning of the new decade, The social network was gradually weakening given the rise of increasingly popular alternatives in our country, such as Facebook. Tuenti lived as an operator for a while, although not for long: after Telefónica launched O2 in mid-2018, rumors began to emerge about Tuenti closing as an operator.

Finally, the rumors were confirmed in April 2022, when we learned of the official closure of Telefónica's low-cost operator: the company Tuenti closed permanently and all its clients became part of O2 and Movistar, depending on the previously contracted rate.

With this announcement, Telefónica put an end to the reign of Tuenti, a brand that began its days as a social network and ended up becoming a virtual mobile operator.

Carbon is one of the most important elements in the world. From providing energy to being in the very food that sustains us, it is abundant everywhere. However, when providing us with energy or materials, we also produce carbon emissions that change our climate.

The 2050 net zero carbon targets are, therefore, vital to humanity's continued existence, and to mitigating the damage that we have already started to cause our planet.

As such, there are many initiatives, programmes, and innovations aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Yet, not as many focus on being completely carbon neutral.

A consortium comprised of nineteen partners in academia and industry, ConsenCUS is a project in Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) that aims to achieve true net zero carbon technologies and make them widely available for industry everywhere.

The locations of these partners include: The Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom, Romania, Greece, China, and Canada. They have come together with €13m of funding over four years under the Horizon 2020 programme.

They aim to achieve this by ConsenCUS: CarbOn Neutral cluSters through Electricity-based iNnovations in Capture, Utilisation and Storage.

An example of this is their net-zero Carbon Cluster approach, planning for regions that employ CCUS technologies and bringing together industries, users, storage, and local communities to not only reduce carbon emissions, but bring them down to net zero. The core ingredients of these Clusters will be as follows:

Using environmentally friendly chemicals and, crucially, renewable electricity, carbon emissions will be captured in industry, such as within factories. Water-soluble potassium hydroxide will be used as a sorbent to capture carbon dioxide molecules, and will be easy to separate again using a 'pH swing.'

From there, the carbon dioxide molecules can be electrochemically converted into much more useful and less harmful chemicals, such as potassium formate. Potassium formate can be used as a preservative, or can be used in protein or fuel production.

Using (renewable) electricity for both the CO2 capture and conversion process allows for an overall net-zero carbon process, which does not rely on residual or fossil heat like competitive technologies.

With the amount of carbon dioxide currently being produced, it is unlikely that all of it will be able to be converted into more useful things. This is what makes carbon storage important, as it still cannot just simply be released into the atmosphere.

The subsurface is under investigation to make storage areas for carbon dioxide, and is showing promising results. ConsenCUS is modelling whether certain types of rock may be suitable for permanent, but also temporary carbon dioxide storage, in case there will be a need for it in the future.

All these aspects will be connected safely and efficiently via secure transportation networks between the emitters, users, and communities, utilising pipelines, trucks or ships. Planning such infrastructure for two clusters (North-West and South-East Europe) is one of the key activities in ConsenCUS.

To understand what citizens within the Net Zero Carbon Clusters think about CCUS as a technology, an array of community events are being organised in the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK, Greece, and Romania.

The goals of the community events are to understand the awareness, concerns, and needs of community members concerning the ConsenCUS project's industrial innovations and CCUS developments more generally. Furthermore, insights and knowledge of community members will help better understand what social, economic, and environmental benefits, risks, and impacts CCUS can have for communities.

To learn from and understand different communities' perspectives about CCUS, one of the methods used is a conversation game called PlayDecide. The game is useful when introducing and discussing complex issues and technologies with groups of people who do not have in-depth technical information about a topic.

In 2023, the ConsenCUS demonstration plant was opened at Aalborg Portland's cement factory in Aalborg, Denmark. This demonstration plant is designed to capture up to 100kg of CO2 per hour and has already shown that carbon dioxide emissions can successfully be captured and converted into formate or formic acid, all through using renewable electricity. This monumental achievement shows that this technology is not only viable, but also has the potential to be scaled up.

More optimisation will be done on this plant, as it moves to two more sites within two different industries that need to get to net-zero emissions: The oil refinery site of OMV Petrom near Ploiesti, Romania, and Grecian Magnesite in Yerakini, Greece, who along with Aalborg Portland, have all committed to developing and utilising these techniques for a better, carbon-neutral future. The focus for the second and third demonstration campaigns is to reach competitive specific energy consumption (again, with electricity rather than heat-based), the proposed scale, and to demonstrate versatility with respect to the flue gas of different industries.

The information from this demonstration plant will also inform engagement with local communities and the impact of CCUS upon them.

Also in 2023, the first Policy Paper was published based on the findings so far. This paper goes over the preliminary outcomes of the ConsenCUS project, and discusses the considerations to be made when deploying CCUS technologies throughout the EU. These considerations are as follows:

These considerations show a commitment to both net zero carbon technologies, but also ensuring that the people and environment in surrounding areas are happy and involved with ConsenCUS' work.

The ConsenCUS project is in its final stages now, and with an active demonstration plant and developing policies, is confident that it can lead the way in CCUS technology and make the world a better place.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will take an 11.7% stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande LNG project, according to a statement Monday. The deal will also give Adnoc 1.9 million tons a year of liquefied natural gas supply from the planned Train 4. NextDecade was up 7.5% in pre-market trading.

Adnoc has been scouring the world for assets to expand its reach and access new markets. It's in talks to buy a chemical company in Europe and is also looking to combine one of its units with subsidiary of Austria's OMV AG to create a $30 billion petrochemical giant. That push coincides with Saudi Aramco's efforts to boost its global presence, after agreeing to buy an LNG company in Australia.

""As global energy demand continues to increase, Adnoc is growing our diversified energy portfolio to ensure a secure, reliable and responsible supply of energy,"" said Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Adnoc's executive director for international growth.

Adnoc's stake in phase one of the Rio Grande project will give it access to the first 3 trains, as production units at LNG facilities are known. Trains 1 to 3 will have a capacity of 17.61 million tons a year, with construction already under way on the first line. Adnoc purchased its stake in the project from Global Infrastructure Partners.

Global Ambition

The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, is using its oil wealth to turn Adnoc into a global energy business. The country, and its Middle East neighbors including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are also investing billions of dollars on gas -- seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition. The UAE aims to be self-sufficient in the fuel by 2030 as it explores at home and adds stakes in fields from Azerbaijan to Egypt.

France's TotalEnergies SE and Mubadala Development Co., an Abu Dhabi government-owned investment fund, are both shareholders in NextDecade. Total holds about 17.4% in the Houston-based developer and Mubadala owns about 5.5%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The French energy giant also holds a stake in phase 1 of the Rio Grande project, along with NextDecade, GIP and, now, Adnoc.

NextDecade plans to make the final investment decision on building Train 4 in the second half of 2024. It already has a license to proceed and so shouldn't be delayed by the Biden administration's decision to put new LNG export project approvals on hold. Adnoc also has an option to take an equity stake in the planned Trains 4 and 5 at the Rio Grande project.

Adnoc, which plans to build its own LNG export facility in the UAE, didn't disclose financial terms of the US transaction. It didn't disclose when the project would be begin operations, nor when the company would begin to receive fuel supplies.

Lysogeny has been identified as the major form of bacteria-phage interaction in the coral-associated microbiome. However, the lysogenic-to-lytic switch of temperate phages in ecologically important coral-associated bacteria and its ecological impact have not been extensively investigated. By studying the prophages in coral-associated Halomonas meridiana, we found that two prophages, Phm1 and Phm3, are inducible by the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C and that Phm3 is spontaneously activated under normal cultivation conditions. Furthermore, Phm3 undergoes an atypical lytic pathway that can amplify and package adjacent host DNA, potentially resulting in lateral transduction. The induction of Phm3 triggered a process of cell-lysis accompanied by the formation of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), and Phm3 attached to OMVs. This unique cell-lysis process was controlled by a four-gene lytic module within Phm3. Further analysis of the Tara Ocean dataset revealed that Phm3 represents a new group of temperate phages that are widely distributed and transcriptionally active in the ocean.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) reportedly plans to set up a trading desk in the United States as part of the UAE state-backed energy firm's global expansion.

The company had recently held talks to recruit senior energy traders to oversee the expansion, Reuters reported Thursday, citing sources. The sources said that ADNOC's plans were not final and could change. However, there would be several benefits to ADNOC's setting up a US trading desk. A trading desk can be involved in buying and selling gas as well as balancing company pipelines to take advantage of current or expected price differentials to maximize profit.

Since 2018, ADNOC has also been developing its trading operations, including ADNOC Trading, which moves crude oil, and ADNOC Global Trading, a joint venture with Italy's ENI and Austria's OMV that handles refined products, such as petroleum. Recently, volatility in the price of commodities has shown that trading can be extremely profitable. A March analysis by consultancy Oliver Wyman found that the commodity trading industry reaped its second-highest year ever in 2023 in terms of profits, banking over $100 billion.

Reuters reported in October 2022 that ADNOC is also planning to open a trading office in Geneva and a representative office in London. One source said the Swiss office reportedly started operating in early May.

ADNOC declined to comment on plans to establish a US trading desk. The company has been bullish on liquefied natural gas (LNG), and a huge spike in energy imports from the United States, mainly due to the boom in fracking and shale gas, has made the United States attractive to Middle East energy providers. Although opposed by environmental activists for causing pollution and releasing toxins into the environment, fracking has allowed US companies to economically access natural gas locked in shale rock formations, resulting in the country becoming the world's leading LNG exporter.

For example, Aramco, the state-owned Saudi oil company, set up offices in Texas, the heartland of US shale.

The United States is sending record amounts of LNG to Europe, and Gulf energy companies want a piece of the action. In 2023, America exported around 11.9 billion cubic feet of LNG per day, a 12% increase compared with the previous year, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.

British energy company Shell forecasted in February that global demand for LNG is expected to grow by 50% by 2040, as countries shift to more environmentally friendly energies than oil.

In March, Reuters reported that ADNOC and Aramco were in talks to invest in US LNG projects. ADNOC is reportedly in talks with LNG firm NextDecade for an offtake from a proposed fourth processing unit at its $18 billion Rio Grande LNG export facility.",al-monitor.com,news,Al-Monitor,,0.2313725490196079,453791562,1,https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/2024-05/GettyImages-1809595464%20copy.jpeg?h=a5ae579a&itok=eepFu-03,eng-9582441

Nonetheless, even without the catalyst of a deal, the stock recorded substantial gains in the meantime. Below, I will give an update on recent developments and how they affect the investment case.

Kindly note that all per share figures refer to common stock. There are also ADRs which represent ¼ share each.

Adnoc Deal Takes Its Time

OMV and Adnoc are currently engaged in advanced discussions of a deal for OMV's 75 percent stake in petrochemicals company Borealis. I have previously written about the strategic viability of such a combination, as well as the reported conditions being negotiated. There have been no material changes on that front, so, in the interest of brevity, I will not go into detail presently. Suffice it here to say that both companies would presumably end up with equal stakes in a combined Borouge-Borealis, with a minority stake being traded as free float. If so, I would assume that the free float would be somewhere in the range of 10 percent of outstanding shares. Additionally, based on the respective valuations and carious cross holdings, OMV would probably need to make an additional investment of somewhere between €1.5 and €2 billion in order to end up with a 45 percent stake in the new entity.

Lately, negotiations between Adnoc and OMV have somewhat slowed down. Austrian media reports of significant differences, especially on the Austrian side. The resignation of Borealis CEO Thomas Gangl (effective June 30th) may also play a role here. It appears increasingly likely that a deal will not be agreed before the Austrian parliamentary elections in late September. This presents an obvious downside, as it adds an element of uncertainty as to the composition of the next Austrian government and its stance on a possible deal with Adnoc. Keep in mind, that OMV is of national importance for Austria and the state holding ÖBAG owns 31.5 percent. In the worst case, A deal might be called off entirely. For the time being, I remain cautiously optimistic, but the risk profile has gradually shifted in an unfavorable direction.

Valuation

My long term valuation method remains largely unchanged. The initial valuation of Borouge-Borealis would likely be somewhere around $30 billion, give or take. The stock market may, of course, end up valuing the company higher or lower than that. Using this figure for the time being, a 45 percent equity stake would represent a value of $13.5 billion (or around €12.4 billion at the time of writing). My assessment of the oil and gas business, meanwhile, remains unchanged.

Applying a rather conservative multiple of 3 times 2022 earnings of €2.4 billion, the remaining divisions (including the downstream oil and gas units) should have a standalone value of around €7.2 billion. I am using 2022 specifically, as it represents a very strong year for the oil and gas sectors, thereby serving as a close approximation of an earnings peak. As a long term investor, I deliberately use peak cycle valuations in order to derive a price target for a cyclical business. In the short term, however, one needs to consider more recent results, too. Q1 revenue declined by a quarter to €8.17 billion YoY due to a decrease in natural gas prices. EPS increased to €1.43 (Q1 2023: €1.19, Q4: 0.72). Yet operating results decreased to €1.48 billion (Q1 2023: €2.07 billion). Overall, the oil market is in robust shape, but the natural gas market has somewhat normalized after windfall profits stemming from the Russian invasion in Ukraine.

Cash and equivalents increased slightly to €7.8 billion, with net debt decreasing to €1.2 billion as of March 31st. One should, however, add to that figure the cost of increasing the stake in a potential Borouge-Borealis. To be on the safe side, I will calculate with €2 billion, thus arriving at a pro forma net debt around €3.2 billion. Based on these considerations, I still believe a price of around €53.5 per share on an undiluted basis to be reasonable.

Absent an eventual Borouge-Borealis combination, the stock would arguably be at least fairly valued as is, one might even view it as moderately overvalued. In that case, all else equal, a 75 percent stake in Borealis would be valued at €8.8 billion, implying a total value of €11.6 billion, which equals a multiple close to of 54 times 2023 net profits of €216 million or about 1.6 times sales. This is not outlandishly cheap. But keep in mind that I assigned a relatively conservative multiple to the oil and gas business.

Dividend

As I keep repeating, one of the factors that drew me to invest in OMV is its dividend policy. In addition to its regular dividend, which the company intends to constantly maintain or increases, OMV introduced special dividends. The aim is to distribute between 20 and 30 percent of operating cash flows as dividends, as long as the leverage ratio is below 30 percent. As of Q1, the leverage ratio remains well below that threshold at a mere 4 percent (Q4: 8 percent). So, for the foreseeable future, I believe that annual distributions of €2.95 + X are to be expected. For 2023, the total dividend amounted to €5.1 per share (€2.95 regular dividend+ €2.1 special dividend). Operating cash flows remain robust (Q1: 1.85 billion), so I am confident that the dividend is quite safe. The company's track record is quite reassuring in that regard, too, with the last cut dating back almost a decade to 2015 and paying a dividend every year since 1994. The significantly higher share price, naturally, reduces the dividend yield. Based on the current share price, I would expect a forward dividend yield between 6.3 and 10.6 percent, subject to the amount of special dividends and under the assumption that the total amount will not exceed €5.1 per share. That is still a decent yield, in my opinion, even with the relatively high Austrian tax rate of 27.5 percent in mind.

Thesis Risk

In terms of risk factors, not that much has changed as compared to when I last covered the stock. Geopolitics remains a concern, with locations such as Lybia or Yemen in which OMV is doing business not becoming materially more politically stable. Another negative aspect is the relatively high percentage of government ownership. The interest of the republic of Austria - or, more precisely, its elected representatives - may not always align with the interests of other shareholders. In particular, political considerations may contribute to overly ambitious ESG commitments at the expense of profitability in the here and now. And, of course, both the energy and the petrochemicals divisions are inherently cyclical businesses.

What has changed is that now, there is a combination of a higher likelihood of the Adnoc negotiations breaking down without result and the fact that a higher share price leaves more short term downside if that were to happen. This, obviously, somewhat elevates the risk profile.

Conclusion

I still believe that OMV is a great business at a reasonable price. It is, however, no longer the screaming buy it was a few months ago. At the current share price, there is still some 15 percent upside to my price target. While that is not nothing, and the dividend remains attractive, one has to take into account the risk of short term downside if, for example, the Adnoc negotiations were to break down. All in all, the risk profile has not changed so much that I am looking to sell, and OMV still makes much sense as an income play. For the time being, I assign a hold rating to the stock, as that is exactly what I intend to do: keep holding the stock, but not necessarily adding to my position at the current price.

ADNOC declined to comment.

ADNOC has been stepping up its global expansion in recent years to find new revenue streams for the Gulf state, including building trading operations since 2018.

It counts two divisions as part of the trading business - ADNOC Trading, focused on crude oil, and ADNOC Global Trading, a joint venture with Italy's Eni ENI.MI and Austria's OMV OMVV.VI, focused on refined products.

Sources have previously told Reuters that ADNOC plans to open a trading office in Geneva and a representative office in London. One source said the Swiss office started up in early May.

The company has also been looking to expand its presence in the growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade, hunting for deals in the U.S., which has become the world's biggest exporter of super-chilled gas as it sends record volumes to Europe.

At the same time, arapid surge in U.S. crude and fuel exports has attracted the likes of Saudi Arabia's state oil giant Aramco to set up trading offices in Texas, the heart of the U.S. shale revolution.

After the 2014 collapse in oil prices, other Middle Eastern energy producers have boosted their trading operations in recent years to gain greater control over the sales of resources they extract, aligning their business models more closely with other major oil producers around the world.

Extreme volatility in commodity prices in recent years has helped trading generate massive profits for energy producers, even when lower prices have hit income from their core businesses.

Tired of their bogus excuses? So are we. Here are their most common lies and the facts to counter them.

False Excuse #1: ""We're only responding to consumer demand""

This is one of the classic arguments for climate inaction from fossil fuel companies: deflecting their responsibilities onto consumers rather than engaging in a real energy transition. No altruistic desire to meet the needs of the population here. They are simply prioritising their profits (in 2023, while people struggled to pay their energy bills, fossil fuel companies made record-breaking profits) and betting on the profitability of oil and gas, at the expense of the environment, the climate, and our health.

They are even doing everything they can to keep us addicted to gas. In Europe, fossil fuel companies have cynically used the war in Ukraine and exploited fears of an energy crisis to push fossil gas as the only solution to avoid it, and con European states into massive, unnecessary investments. We've seen this with TotalEnergies' LNG terminal in France, or OMV's Neptun Deep gas drilling project in Romania, among other projects.

False Excuse #2: ""Gas is a transition energy""

The idea that fossil gas is a clean or low-carbon energy is completely false. It is a fossil fuel, just like coal and oil, and it already accounts for 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Its consequences are not limited to the climate: environmental damage, biodiversity destruction, human rights violations, geopolitical conflicts...

And contrary to what gas companies often claim, a fully renewable energy system does not need fossil gas. In 2018, Costa Rica ran on renewable energy alone for 300 days. Many studies also show that a 100% renewable energy system is already possible in many countries, including Germany or the Philippines. Eliminating gas can be done by replacing gas with renewable energy solutions through electrification, reducing overall energy demand through efficiency and sufficiency, and developing energy storage and demand flexibility.

False Excuse #3: ""We won't move away from fossil fuels overnight""

To justify their climate-damaging activities, fossil fuel companies constantly use this 'wait and see' argument. Remember, they have known about the climate crisis and the damage they are causing for decades, yet they continue to bet on fossil fuel development.

The climate crisis is escalating. To stay within the 1.5 degree target, all new gas, oil and coal projects must be stopped immediately and fossil fuels must be phased out by mid-century, with industrialised countries taking the lead. We won't move away from fossil fuels overnight, but we need to do so quickly. For this energy transition to succeed, it has to meet the needs of the population, to ensure a fair transition for workers, and it needs to start now.

False Excuse #4: ""We're investing a lot in renewable energy""

It's crystal clear: fossil fuel companies intend to remain so for as long as possible. While they use renewables in their advertising to greenwash their business, actual investment in renewable energy is minimal. Only 7.3% of 12 major European oil and gas companies' 2022 investments went towards green energy - the remaining 92.7% was funding fossil business as usual, and in some cases even its expansion. The share of renewable energy in these 12 companies' energy mix in 2022 was on average below 1%. And globally, oil and gas companies currently only account for 1% of all global investments into clean energy.

These numbers clearly show that the fossil fuel industry does not play a role in the global energy transition and cannot be taken seriously. Many fossil fuel companies have even announced plans to further increase oil and gas production in the coming years.

False Excuse #5: ""We contribute to the economy and improve living conditions in developing countries""

The exploitation of oil and gas primarily serves the private interests of fossil fuel companies. Fossil fuel projects developed in Global Majority countries - often by corporations headquartered in Global Minority countries - are part of a neocolonial logic. Corrupt elites often pocket the revenues while local communities suffer the dangerous consequences of fossil fuel extraction. Expanding fossil fuel extraction in Global Majority countries also locks countries and communities into a toxic fossil-fueled economic system.

In Yemen, TotalEnergies' oil activities are reportedly causing serious contamination of soil and groundwater, with catastrophic health consequences. In Uganda and Tanzania, people are being dispossessed of their land: it is estimated that over 118,000 people will be displaced by the EACOP and Tilenga projects. Overall, fossil-fuelled human rights abuses are widespread, as Greenpeace Belgium has shown.

False Excuse #6: ""If we don't do it, others will""

This is a classic derailment strategy. The response ""but what about the other companies"" is whataboutism, a technique of responding to an accusation by making a counter-accusation or raising another issue. Moreover, this is not reality. In 2018, Greenpeace France mobilised to stop the TotalEnergies project in the Amazon reef. Following this decision, no other company has started oil exploration in this protected area.

The stalled merger discussions between Borealis and Borouge were also mentioned as a factor in the downgrade, as it diminishes the prospects of a positive catalyst emerging from a potential agreement.

The UAE Government-backed oil and gas company has been looking to expand globally in recent years as it seeks new revenue streams for the Gulf state.

Since 2018, it has been developing its trading operations, which now include ADNOC Trading, handling crude oil, and ADNOC Global Trading, a joint venture with Eni of Italy and OMV of Austria, focusing on refined products.

There have been reports that ADNOC is also planning to open a trading office in Geneva and a representative office in London, with the Swiss office reportedly commencing operations in early May.

Additionally, the business has been searching for opportunities in the US to increase its footprint in the expanding liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade.

This move comes as US crude and fuel exports have seen a significant rise, drawing major players such as Saudi Aramco to establish trading offices in Texas.

Middle Eastern energy producers including ADNOC have been enhancing their trading operations since the 2014 oil price collapse, seeking to exert more control over the sale of their resources and align their business models with other global oil giants.

Earlier this month, ADNOC signed a long-term agreement with Germany's EnBW to supply LNG.

The 15-year contract involves the delivery of 600,000 tonnes per annum of LNG from ADNOC's Ruwais LNG project in Al Ruwais Industrial City, Abu Dhabi.

This deal with EnBW is the third for the Ruwais LNG project, which has a total capacity of 9.6 million tonnes per annum.

Among these is the CFE TEIT, the OMV of the Mexican state, in charge of the Federal Telecommunications Commission, and the CFE TEIT launched a proposal for mobile internet to be able to connect everywhere.

It is a small device that works as a portable modem to have access to our own private and portable WiFi network. Up to 10 devices can be connected at the same time, including cell phones, tablets and laptops. We teach you how to buy it, configure it and use it.

The MIFI is part of the ""Internet for all"" program of the OMV of the Mexican state. This small device can create a portable broadband WiFi network, to navigate wherever, as long as we are in one with CFE TEIT coverage in the country. Fortunately, the operator already has more than 1,500 antennas throughout the country, and they plan to install many more.

How to buy MIFI: to buy it we must access the CFE TEIT websitego to the ""MIFI CFE Mobile Internet"" tab and then enter our zip code to check the availability of the service.

How much does MIFI cost?: The modem has a base price of 1,145 Mexican pesos, which includes the device itself, its battery, a charging cable, and a SIM card loaded with 5 GB of available data. Then we can buy data packages, among the available packages there are from 5 GB to 100 GBwith prices ranging from 95 pesos per month to almost 1,000 pesos per month.

How to use MIFI- Getting started with MIFI is really easy. The first thing we must do is an initial configuration upon receiving it. To do this we need the IMEI of the MIFI, which is found on the box and inside the device, and we write down the last four digits of the code, we must also write down the 10 numbers of the SIM card.

Next, we insert the SIM card into the device and the battery. Finally, we turn on the device by pressing the ""Power"" or power button. And we're done. When you turn on the device, the second light from left to right will turn red when it is establishing a connection, and in green when the connection is already available.

To connect from the cell phone, we access the WiFi connection menu and look for the MIFI network, whose name is similar to ""CFEInternetxxxx"" either ""MyCFExxxx"" (replacing the ""X"" with the last 4 digits of the IMEI code). The default password is ""MiCFE"" followed by the same four digits. We can repeat the connection process on any other cell phone, tablet or computer.",gearrice.com,news,Gearrice,William Jebor,0.04313725490196085,453611079,9,https://i.blogs.es/717113/cfe-mifi/840_560.jpeg,

Sources with knowledge of the plan revealed to Reuters that the UAE-backed oil and gas giant is actively seeking senior energy traders to spearhead this initiative.

The move aligns with ADNOC's broader objective to diversify revenue streams beyond its traditional base in the Gulf. Since 2018, ADNOC has been ramping up its trading operations, and this latest endeavor is a continuation of that strategy. The company has yet to make an official statement regarding these plans, and sources indicated that the details are still subject to change.

ADNOC's trading business is bifurcated into two main divisions: ADNOC Trading, which focuses on crude oil, and ADNOC Global Trading, a joint venture with Italy's Eni and Austria's OMV, which handles refined products. This dual-structured approach has been central to ADNOC's efforts to enhance its global market presence.

Earlier reports suggested ADNOC's intentions to establish a trading office in Geneva, with operations commencing in early May. Additionally, the company is exploring the establishment of a representative office in London, further underscoring its commitment to expanding its footprint in key financial hubs.

In tandem with these initiatives, ADNOC is also pursuing opportunities in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, particularly in the U.S., which has emerged as the world's leading exporter of LNG. The burgeoning LNG trade offers lucrative prospects as Europe seeks to diversify its energy sources.

This expansion mirrors similar moves by other Middle Eastern oil giants, such as Saudi Aramco, which has set up trading offices in Texas, capitalizing on the U.S. shale boom. The trend among Middle Eastern energy producers to bolster their trading operations has been driven by a need for greater control over the marketing of their resources, especially following the 2014 oil price collapse.

Investment action

I recommended a buy rating for OMV AG (OTCPK:OMVJF) when I wrote about it during last year March, as I liked the valuation set up, where OMV was trading at 2.5x EBITDA and had an indicated yield of 12%. My expectations played out well, in that OMV valuation did start to track back towards its historical multiple of 4x (now trading at 3.4x forward EBITDA), driving a total return of 31% (~15% from dividends). Based on my current outlook and analysis, I recommend a hold rating. My key update to my thesis is that valuation is no longer attractive, both on a dividend yield basis and a forward EBITDA basis. The poor earnings outlook should put a lid on how much valuation multiples can move up from here. For readers that followed my previous recommendation, OMV has delivered a nice return of 31%, but I no longer think an attractive return is possible from here.

Review

OMV reported earnings on April 30th with total revenue of EUR8.36 billion, clean operating profit of EUR1.48 billion, and adj net income of EUR696 million. Breaking it down by details, Clean CCS operating result was EUR1.48 billion, driven by Chemicals and Materials EBIT of EUR129 million, Energy EBIT of EUR1 billion, and Fuels & Feedstock EBIT of EUR303 million. Based on my review, the results were alright, but the outlook has gotten relative poorer than the last time I wrote about the company. Dividend yield is also a lot lesser at ~6%, and the potential valuation upside is a lot lesser today. Hence, I am downgrading my rating from buy to hold.

Firstly, on OMV's Energy earnings outlook, I am negative on it. According to Wood Mackenzie's analysis, gas prices could fall as low as $6.7/mmbtu as storage levels remain 55%. This comes at a where management guided for FY24 production to be between 330-350 kboepd in 2024, somewhat inline vs FY23. Note that Energy is a large part of clean CCS EBIT, and because of the mix (~70%), weak gas price outlook is going to really hurt OMV.

With storage levels nearing full capacity towards the end of the summer, there will be up to 10 bcm of excess supply that will need to either be piped into underground storage facilities in Ukraine or floated in LNG vessels"". says Mauro Chavez, Director of Europe Gas & LNG Markets at Wood Mackenzie. This means that a higher summer-winter differential is required to balance the market, compared to what the current forward curve suggests, putting downward pressure on Q3 prices.

Secondly, on Chemicals, there may be some improvement in the Chemicals segment in 1Q24, but I'm still wary because it could be due to short-lived problems with Asian imports via the Red Sea. OMV's operations and its push towards a lower carbon future have been bolstered by its downstream diversification and chemicals expansion, which, in my opinion, has been a significant step in improving OMV position in the value chain towards focus on higher-value and lower-carbon chemical products. As can be seen from 1Q24, this strategy has been successful, with solid chemicals results driving earnings supported by strong polyolefin margins (which grew 26% sequentially). I have a less optimistic view of the future because the petrochemical industry is currently experiencing overcapacity due to excessive investment over a number of years, combined with weak demand.

Lastly, OMV's Refining & Marketing earnings should also see headwinds as refining margins continue to normalize. In 1Q24, OMV's refining indicator margin for Europe rebounded to $10.8/bbl vs. 9.9 in 4Q23, an 8% sequential growth. Historically, OMV has seen a margin of around mid-single-digit dollars, and it was only recently, due to COVID, supply chain disruption, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, that margins reached a height of ~$30. This is not sustainable, and OMV results have shown a continuous normalization (downward) trend. I expect the trend to continue given capacity additions.

Valuation

Valuation is certainly less attractive today after the run-up in valuation. Firstly, on a dividend yield basis, OMV's indicated yield now is around 6%, or ~17x DPS, and this is where OMV has historically traded. Secondly, on a forward EBITDA basis, multiples have run up as I expected (from ~2x to the current ~3.4x); however, because of the poor earnings outlook, I don't see a compelling reason that valuation multiples will continue to move up from here. Viewed together, I believe OMV is trading where it should be trading, and hence, I am downgrading to a hold rating.

Final thoughts

My recommendation is a downgrade to hold. While the company delivered decent results in 1Q24, particularly in the Chemicals segment, the overall earnings outlook is not very positive. Weak gas prices, potential overcapacity in the petrochemical industry, and normalizing refining margins are all headwinds for OMV. Additionally, the valuation is no longer attractive, with the dividend yield down to 6% and limited potential for further multiple expansion. While OMV has delivered a good return for investors who followed my previous recommendation, I believe the easy gains have already been captured and further upside is limited.

It is something that Digi was already doing, and now Lowi has also joined the trend of ultra cheap fiber.

The trick is to offer special conditions to those users who have own fiber coverage (Fiber Fit, as Lowi has named), while the most general offer of Vodafone's OMV is also the one that Goes further, thanks to indirect fiber.

To welcome the Fit fiber, Lowi has launched a parallel fare offer whose differences go beyond price, basic conditions or fiber coverage. Let's go see them.

Lowi's traditional rates will continue to be available to all users with direct and indirect fiber access, and offer both fiber only, as combined with fiber, mobile and Amazon Prime.

Its price starts at 30 euros per month for the combined ones and most users access through FTTH, which guarantees that 76% will have symmetrical speed, approximately 22 million UUII.

Network industries, including electricity, natural gas, rail transportation and telecommunications, consist of potentially competitive activities, such as electricity generation, with naturally monopolistic ones, such as transmission and distribution of electricity. This combination produces a unique set of challenges to competition law and policy in designing a market structure and regulatory framework which maximise the benefits of liberalisation while effectively controlling any tendencies to monopolistic abuse. Mumbai, India where parallel licencing in electricity retail was introduced unintentionally illustrates this challenge.

The Electricity Act 2003 (EA 2003) provides for opening up electricity distribution to the private sector. Section 14 of EA 2003 which allows parallel licencing states that ""the appropriate commission may grant a licence to two or more persons for distribution of electricity through their own distribution system within the same area, subject to the conditions that the applicant for grant of licence. The grant of the licence within the same area, subject to the conditions that the applicant for grant of licence within the same area shall, without prejudice to the other conditions or requirements under this Act, comply with the additional requirements (including the capital adequacy, credit-worthiness, or code of conduct) as may be prescribed by the Central Government, and no such applicant who complies with all the requirements for grant of licence, shall be refused grant of licence on the ground that there already exists a licensee in the same area for the same purpose"".

Parallel licensing in Mumbai was initiated not through policy or a careful reading of Section 14 of EA 2003, but through litigation over power purchase agreements (PPAs) between existing players when EA 2003 was enacted. Analysis of the outcome may be seen both as a muddle or a model for delicencing electricity retail across India in the future.

The ""muddle"" lens of the electricity delicencing experiment in Mumbai exposes sub-optimal outcomes for customers and complex challenges for regulators, who need to balance the interests of the licensees and those of the consumers, and also for the judiciary that has to interpret Section 14 and related provisions of EA 2003. Despite multiple regulatory and judicial interventions since 2008, expected outcome of competitive tariff for consumers has not materialised. In addition, issues of cherry picking of consumers by one distribution licensee (DL) in the area served by the other, disputes over duplication of distribution networks, cherry picking of consumers, use of networks owned by one licensee by the other, and over cross subsidies over use of the distribution network, power purchase agreements (PPAs) continue to persist along with other challenges.

Since the introduction of parallel licencing in 2008, Tata Power Corporation -- Distribution (TPCD) and Reliance Infrastructure Distribution (erstwhile Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited or BSES, later acquired by Reliance Infrastructure limited [Rinfra] which was taken over by Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited [AEML] in 2017), the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport [BEST] and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited [MSEDCL] have indulged in legal conflict over the interpretation of provisions in section 14 of EA 2003.

In 2008, the Supreme Court held that TPCD, that was a bulk supplier of electricity in Mumbai and was entitled to supply electricity in retail, directly to all consumers within its area of supply, as stipulated in its licences following provisions of EA 2003. Subsequently, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) confirmed TPCD as a DL for the entire city of Mumbai, covering the licence areas of both BEST and Rinfra. TPCD's distribution licence was valid up to August 2014. In 2014, TPCD secured a licence to distribute electricity in the entire Mumbai district, part of the Mumbai suburban district and the entire municipal corporation area(legally contested). The distribution licence (DL) was granted for a period of 25 years effective from August 2014 till August 2039. The DL covered an area overlapping the entire licensed area of Rinfra, BEST and MSEDCL.

Historically, TPCD was a power generator and bulk supplier of power in Mumbai. One of the bulk power purchasers with whom TPCD had signed PPAs was Rinfra. This relationship created unique challenges when TPCD entered distribution. As TPCD had access to low-cost power, it was able to offer lower tariffs to consumers in areas where it was a parallel licensee. This facilitated bulk consumers and eventually also domestic consumers to switch suppliers from Rinfra to TPCD. This was an intended outcome. However, TPCD had no incentive to supply power to Rinfra at competitive rates. This imposed additional costs on Rinfra in securing PPAs with alternative suppliers. For its part, Rinfra could impose wheeling charges on TPCD for transporting electricity on behalf of TPCD on its distribution network. These issues were part of the legal conflict between the players in the arena. The prospect of TPCD building its own distribution network, thus duplicating the existing network controlled by Rinfra was another contested issue. The result was a patchwork of temporary solutions imposed by the regulatory and other institutions such as cost plus mechanism for tariff determination. The cost-plus mechanism allowed parallel distributers in Mumbai to source expensive power purchased through short-term power markets and pass on the costs to the consumer. Customer interest was compromised as the cost of power procured through short-term markets was typically higher than that of power purchased through long-term PPAs. Customers also had to bear the risk of uncertainty in tariffs when a large share of the power supplied was procured through short-term markets. Structural barriers such as limitation in transmission capacity limited low-cost power procurement from outside the Mumbai area through competitive bidding. This meant a higher average tariff for consumers. When regulated tariff did not permit full cost recovery, DLs transformed unrecovered costs into regulatory assets, essentially costs recoverable from customers in the future through regulated tariffs. This was not an intended outcome of competition in retail electricity. Seen through the ""muddle"" lens, parallel licensing in Mumbai highlights inequitable outcomes for consumers reflected in high and uncertain tariffs and sub-optimal consequences of regulatory inadequacy reflected in incessant litigation. This is not an outcome that one would expect in Mumbai which exhibits high household density (number of consumers per unit area), a distribution network that is mostly underground that reduces losses, few agricultural consumers and higher household incomes compared to most of the rest of India all of which contribute to lower distribution losses and greater tolerance for higher electricity tariff. And yet parallel licencing has not been a great success.

The ""model"" lens highlights the introduction of private players in electricity distribution and the consequent improvement in the financial and technical efficiency of their operations. Even small improvements in the economic and technical efficiency of operations of private licensees' stands in contrast to the persistent underperformance of state-run distribution companies (discoms) that are forced to carry social burdens (sustaining employment and subsidies). The annual integrated rating and ranking of power sector utilities by power finance corporation (PFC) rates distribution companies on parameters based on (i) financial sustainability (average cost of supply[ACS]-annual revenue realised [ARR], days receivable, days payable to gencos and transcos, adjusted quick ratio, debt service coverage ratio, leverage [debt/earnings before interest, tax and amortization]) (ii) performance (distribution loss, billing efficiency, collection efficiency, corporate governance and (iii) external environment (subsidy realised, loss taken over by state government, government dues, tariff cycle timelines and auto pass-through of fuel costs). In the 12 annual rating and ranking of distribution companies for 2023, six out of the top ten ranks go to private companies and the top rank and rating goes to one of the parallel licensees in Mumbai, Adani Energy Mumbai Limited (AEML). AEML serves 7 divisions of Mumbai city and serves over 3 million retail customers. It has no agricultural consumers and over 14 percent of its customers are from the commercial & industrial segments. AEML had a billing efficiency of 93.7 percent and collection efficiency of 99.8 percent. Its days receivable was 17 and days payable was 38. The aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) in the areas served by AEML fell from 11 percent to about 6 percent over 5 years. AEML also claims that it has increased the share of renewables from 3 percent to over 30 percent with 50,000 green tariff customers. In 2023, applications of Adani Electricity Navi Mumbai (AENML) and Torrent Power Ltd (TPL) were pending before MERC for parallel licences in the jurisdiction of the MSEDCL illustrating the attractiveness of the business for private players.

Since the implementation of parallel licencing in Mumbai, structural issues that contributed to the ""muddle"" have improved substantially. There are a number of options for retail distributers to source power as constraints in transmission have been resolved. This has eliminated the need for cost-plus regulation of tariff. Overall tariff and uncertainty over tariff have reduced for domestic retail consumers. Consumer experience with billing and exercise of choice has also improved substantially with introduction of new technology. Separation of carriage (wires) and content (electricity) is yet to materialise physically but it is functioning in practice with the use of distribution network common to all the DLs who pay wheeling charges. The two private parallel licensees TPCD and AEML have no regulatory assets as of 2022, and their financial sustainability is among the best in the country. However, this does not mean that the parallel licencing muddle is now a model for the rest of the country. Unique features of Mumbai city that include high density with no agricultural consumers, greater incomes that can accommodate higher tariff and a long history of private sector presence in generation and distribution that are critical to accommodating parallel licencing cannot be replicated across the country. In many states agricultural or subsidised consumption of electricity is dominant and incumbent distribution companies are saddled with high levels of debt. The Mumbai model demonstrates the tendency of DLs to ""vertically integrate"" with their own sister concerns that generate power. This has the potential to limit the benefits of competition in retail particularly in the context of reducing tariff. The fact that there is no fully evolved wholesale market for power procurement along with the fact that there is no market for fuels (coal, natural gas, hydro, nuclear, renewables) has limited reduction in tariff, one of the key benefits of competition.

Regulation is necessary, because in most cities or States in India, no more than two or three DLs are likely to compete. This would be oligopolistic competition with limited benefits. The complexities in sourcing power in the early stages of introducing parallel licencing in Mumbai clearly highlights that wholesale competition must be in place before retail competition is introduced across the nation. In the case of Mumbai, retail competitor Rinfra was dependent upon its retail rival TPCD for its electricity supply. This created a price squeeze situation. Judiciary and regulatory interventions were inadequate in addressing price squeeze. Competition continues to be limited to a struggle for customers between privately owned and publicly-owned DLs in Mumbai. The arena for competition should be expanded, as the wireless telecommunications industry illustrates, to offer benefits to consumers not obtainable from regulation alone. Studies have shown that the only successful regulation of electric utilities has been to introduce competition and competitive interaction that eliminates the need for regulation. In mature electricity markets, distribution utilities exposed to true competition have lowered prices and gained sales. More crucially, their finances have met the regulatory test of attracting capital for expansion. In a number of cases, rates of return have risen and exceeded those of comparable companies not under competition. The key lesson from the Mumbai muddle is for legislators, regulators, and courts to recognize that regulation is not a substitute for competition, but rather is an adjunct to competition.

According to Union Ministry of Power, peak power demand in India is likely to cross 400 GW (gigawatt) by 2030 and more generation capacity is being set up to meet the rising demand. Electricity is the most important infrastructure which is a sine qua non for development, it said. One major distinguishing feature between a developing and a developed country is that in a developed country, there is no load shedding. It said that the nation will add enough capacity to meet this burgeoning demand.

The national capital's peak power demand recorded an all-time high winter power demand, reaching 5,816 megawatt (MW) - the highest ever for the winter months, surpassing the previous record of 5,798 MW set on 19 January. Remarkably, this is the sixth instance in January when Delhi's power demand exceeded last year's peak winter demand of 5,526 MW, recorded on 6 January 2023. Barring 2 January, the city's peak demand has consistently surpassed 5,000 MW every day this month so far. The surge in power demand comes on the back of a cold wave across northern India. In the areas served by BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL), peak demand reached 2,526 MW and 1,209 MW, respectively. As per the Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, it met its highest winter peak power demand of 1,826 MW.

The 4,000 MW power project -- Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (PVUNL) -- a joint venture of the NTPC Ltd and the Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) formed after scrapping the old Patratu Thermal Power Station (PTPS) will bring a revolutionary change in the power sector of Jharkhand, making it self-sufficient in terms of power requirement. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the NTPC and the JBVNL, 85 percent of the power produced from PVUNL will be supplied to Jharkhand. The mega power plant conceived in 2016 will comprise five units of 800 MW each and will be commissioned in two phases -- 2,400 MWs (3x800 MW) in the first phase and 1,600 MWs (2x800) in the second phase.

Discom Reform

A roadmap to eliminating power cuts, which has eluded the Noida city (Uttar Pradesh) for decades even as it has grown manifold - both in terms of economy and population - is finally taking shape. The Noida Authority has allocated INR2 billion (bn) (US$24.1 million (mn)) for a pilot project to move power transmission lines under the ground in three sectors -- 3, 15A and 47. Apart from these sectors, the Authority will shift 11 kV (kilovolt) and 33 kV lines underground in some other areas of the city where roads are undergoing a revamp. Occurring almost daily, power cuts have stood out as a sore point in Noida's concerted push to promote the NCR city as a business destination.

Polaris Smart Metering has secured two smart meter projects totalling INR52 bn (US$627.4 mn) in Uttar Pradesh. Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL) has awarded the contracts for installing over 5.1 million smart meters in the important clusters of Lucknow and Ayodhya/Devipatan, which the company plans to install over the next 27 months. As per the agreement, Polaris Smart Metering will supply, commission, install and maintain smart meters for consumers and system metering across the consumer base in these clusters for the next 10 years.

Electric equipment maker HPL Electric and Power has bagged an order worth INR2.4 bn (29 mn) for smart meters from Advanced Metering Infrastructure Service Provider (AMISP). This accomplishment adds to HPL's already existing significant order pipeline, reinforcing its ongoing upward momentum in the dynamic smart meter sector, the company said.

Generation

Prime Minister (PM) of India dedicated two power projects by NTPC and laid the foundation stone of another with a total investment of INR289.78 bn (US$3.5 bn) in Odisha on 3 February. Located in Sundergarh district, the Darlipali STPP is a pit-head power station with supercritical (highly efficient) technology and will supply low-cost power to its beneficiary states such as Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Sikkim. The 250 MW project of NTPC-SAIL Power Company Ltd was established in Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) to provide reliable power for the steel plant, which is vital for economic growth. NTPC is developing the Talcher Thermal Power Project, Stage-III, within the old TTPS plant premises in Angul district, was taken over by NTPC from Odisha State Electricity Board in 1995.

Regulation and Governance

According to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre is moving towards making the electricity bill of the households in the country zero. PM's remarks came while addressing a gathering after inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of projects worth INR115.99 bn (US$1.4 bn) in Guwahati.

The Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, a Rajasthan government-owned power discom (distribution company), vehemently opposed in the Supreme Court (SC) a plea of Adani Power seeking over INR13 bn (US$156.9 mn) as late payment surcharge (LPS) from the state discom. A bench comprising Justices Aniruddha Bose and PV Sanjay Kumar reserved its order on Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd (APRL)'s petition pertaining to its demand for late payment surcharge after hearing heated arguments by senior lawyers Abhishek Singhvi and Dushyant Dave.

According to Union Ministry of Power, the Union government is looking to set March 2025 as the deadline for 24x7 electricity supply across the country. After connecting all households with electricity supply through two flagship schemes in the past decade, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government now plans to ensure uninterrupted reliable power supply by the end of 2024-25 (FY25).

North & South America

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), United States (US) power consumption will rise to record highs in 2024 and 2025. EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,112 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2024 and 4,123 billion kWh in 2025. That compares with 3,994 billion kWh in 2023 and a record 4,070 billion kWh in 2022. As homes and businesses use more electricity instead of fossil fuels for heat and transportation, EIA forecast 2024 power sales would rise to 1,530 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,396 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,035 billion kWh for industrial customers. That compares with all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,391 billion kWh in 2022 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

According to the US EIA, wholesale electricity prices for 2024 in most areas of the US are seen to be close to or slightly lower than in 2023, because of relatively stable generation fuel costs. Periods of high demand or power market supply constraints, however, could lead to temporary spikes in wholesale prices, it said. EIA forecasts US wholesale prices to range between US$30 per megawatt hour (MWh) and US$40 per MWh outside of the Northeast, where the agency expects prices to increase and average US$48/MWh in New York and US$60/MWh in New England. The main source of electricity in the US is natural gas-fired generation, with EIA expecting natural gas prices for the production of electricity to average US$2.91 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2024 compared with US$3.29 per mmBtu in 2023. In most areas, average wholesale electricity costs should remain lower than or comparable to those of the previous year due to lower natural gas prices, the report said. US wholesale power prices are typically calculated on an hourly or daily basis and are designed to reflect market conditions at a specific time.

A winter storm bringing snow, ice and high winds to parts of the US Midwest and Pacific Northwest knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, with a brutal freeze expected to grip numerous states. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said storms continue to cause flight cancellations and delays. Some 150,000 homes and businesses were without power in Michigan. Power was out for another 200,000-plus customers in Oregon and Wisconsin.

The Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) lifted the grid alert issued earlier in the day asking customers to reduce their consumption to avoid a power shortfall after a demand spike caused by extreme cold. The AESO earlier declared the grid alert and asked citizens to immediately reduce their electricity use to essential needs in response to ongoing extreme cold temperatures across western Canada, restricted imports and very high demand. The AESO had projected a shortfall of up to 200 megawatt (MW) of electricity during the peak evening hours and warned of potential rotating outages until demand declined or generation returned to the grid. The AESO said after the alert was issued, it almost immediately saw a 100 MW drop in electricity demand which rose to 200 MW within minutes.

Europe & Russia

Norwegian natural gas exports were curtailed due to an unplanned outage at the Nyhamna processing plant following a power cut at the weekend amid high winds, operator Shell, opens new tab said. The power line which tripped and caused the outage at Nyhamna was repaired late, transmission grid operator Statnett said.

Ukraine reported a surplus of electricity production and intends to export it to neighbouring Moldova and Poland, Ukrainian energy ministry said. Ukraine had produced more energy than it consumed before the Russian invasion in 2022, but that output has dropped since the Russian attacks on power facilities and the occupation of Europe's largest Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said that Ukraine could resume substantial energy exports as early as this spring due to lower consumption. Ukraine banned exports during the last heating season amid Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system and large-scale shutdowns.

Major German power utility EnBW, opens new tab, a likely bidder in auctions for building initially gas-fired generation capacity under a new government scheme, could draw on its existing plant sites, its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andreas Schell said. The company, alongside sector peers Uniper and RWE, opens new tab, is tipped to be among those responding to the long-awaited roadmap laying out details of a possibly €40 billion (US$43.6 billion) plan to avoid power shortages caused by volatile renewable generation, once coal is abandoned. The plan entails state-support for perhaps 20-25 GW of electricity-producing capacity by 2035, which will either be new stations or old ones that are converted, and which are made ready for clean hydrogen operations in the long term. Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said a much-anticipated roadmap for how a new generation of gas-fired power plants would be put out to tender was imminent, fuelling hopes of financial support for the construction of these stations. The plan, with an estimated cost of up to €40 bn (US$43.5 bn), aims to ensure enough electricity generation until renewable energy can overcome storage issues and inadequate grid technology to fully replace fossil fuels. German stakeholders were set to agree a deal on the power plant expansion strategy, which has drawn criticism from environmental campaigners keen to phase out coal and gas as soon as possible.

Sweden's power demand could rise some 150 percent by 2045, transmission grid operator Svenska kraftnat said, driven by plans for new industrial developments and the conversion of fossil fuel-based industries to non-polluting energy sources. Overall demand could rise from 138 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to just over 340 TWh in 2045 under two of the four scenarios the TSO presented in its latest long-term market analysis. The scenarios were deemed the most likely as they closely align with government projections of 300 TWh demand in 2045. To meet the higher demand, Sweden would need to add on average 7.5 TWh of new power generation per year over the next 20 years.

12 February: India's demand for petroleum products is likely to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in the financial year ending March 2024, following a 10 percent post-pandemic recovery in 2022-23, according to Fitch Ratings. Both petrol and diesel sales recorded robust 4-6 percent increases in the first nine months of 2023-24, fuelled by heightened economic activities in the agriculture and power sectors, coupled with a surge in holiday travel and auto sales. Fitch said it expects Indian refiners' gross refining margins (GRM) to moderate during 2024-25 from the strong levels expected in 2023-24, but remain above mid-cycle levels. By 2025-26, it foresees a shift closer to mid-cycle levels, but remaining resilient, bolstered by the escalating demand for end-products. In the upstream segment, domestic oil and gas production has modestly increased, driven by a 5 percent rise in gas production in the first nine months of 2023-24. Fitch forecasts the oil and gas sector's high capex intensity to continue in the medium term, particularly with upstream companies investing in production enhancement.

8 February: India wants to sign a multi-year oil purchase deal with Guyana and acquire stakes in the South American nation's exploration areas, the Guyanese minister for natural resources Vickram Bharrat said. He said any such deal with India would have to be approved by Guyana's cabinet. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, wants to diversify its crude sources. India approved the signing of a five-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Guyana earlier this month for cooperation in energy. After a meeting with India's Oil Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, Bharat said Indian companies are interested in picking up stakes in Guyana's exploration acreage through negotiation rather than a bidding process.

8 February: India's fuel consumption rose 8.2 percent year-on-year in January, government data showed, helped by strong industrial activity in the world's third largest oil consumer. Total consumption, a proxy for oil demand, totalled 20.04 million tonnes (MT) in January, up from 18.51 MT a year earlier, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed. Consumption held relatively steady month-on-month from December's seven-month high of 20.05 MT.

8 February: At the India Energy Week 2024 in Goa, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) took a significant step towards enhancing the efficiency of LPG cylinder delivery in India. The company has launched a ground-breaking initiative titled ""Pure for Sure"" that emphasizes quality and quantity assurance for LPG cylinders. The announcement was made by the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, with the aim of improving customer satisfaction. The ""Pure for Sure"" initiative is a first-of-its-kind in the industry, designed to ensure the integrity of the product from the production plant to the customer's doorstep. To do so, BPCL has introduced a tamper-proof seal with QR codes on the cylinders. When these QR codes are scanned, customers receive a pop-up and a signature tune that indicates the cylinder's gross weight at the time of filling, enabling them to verify the cylinder before acceptance. In a progressive move, BPCL plans to include women in the LPG delivery process, acknowledging their understanding of the product. This shift not only promotes gender equality but also adds a unique perspective to the delivery process. With the launch of the ""Pure for Sure"" initiative, BPCL is poised to redefine the standard in LPG cylinder delivery, focusing on reliability, transparency, and excellence in customer service.

7 February: India is expected to be the largest driver of global oil demand growth between 2023 and 2030, narrowly taking the lead from top importer China, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The world's third-largest oil importer and consumer is on track to post an oil demand increase of almost 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) between 2023 and 2030, accounting for more than one-third of the projected 3.2 million bpd of global increases in the period, the IEA said in a report. The agency forecast India's demand would reach 6.6 million bpd in 2030, up from 5.5 million bpd in 2023. The single largest basis of India's oil consumption will be diesel fuel, accounting for almost half of the rise in the nation's demand and more than one-sixth of total global oil demand growth through to 2030, the IEA said. Jet fuel is poised to grow 5.9 percent annually on average but this will be from a low base compared with other countries, it said. To meet this demand, India is expected to add 1 million bpd of new refining capacity over the seven-year period and this will increase its crude imports further to 5.8 million bpd by 2030, the IEA said.

7 February: Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd (ISPRL) has signed a deal with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) to lease 300,000 metric tonnes of storage space for three years in a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in Vizag in southern India. ISPRL operates three SPRs in southern India with combined capacity of about 5 million tonnes (MT). ISPRL said the contract with HPCL is for two years with a provision to extend it by one year. The 1.03 MT SPR at Vizag is half filled with Iraqi oil. And after leasing of space to HPCL, there is scope to rent out the remainder 200,000 tonnes space. ISPRL will soon invite bids to lease out half of the 1.5 MT SPR in Mangalore, where one of the two equally sized compartments has been leased to UAE's ADNOC. ISPRL has been selling from the caverns to local refiners after a change in the government rules in 2021.

13 February: Clean fuel supply in Kolkata is set to receive a significant boost in the coming months with the completion of the main trunk GAIL gas transportation pipeline. Bengal Gas Company Ltd CEO (chief executive officer) Anupam Mukhopadhyay stated that the GAIL gas pipeline would be completed within the next three months, with the resolution of an 800-meter hurdle and the necessary statutory clearances.

8 February: India's Petronet LNG plans to begin supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to neighbouring Sri Lanka for five years starting in 2025, its chief executive officer (CEO) Akshay Kumar Singh said. Petronet will ship 850 metric tonnes of gas daily to the island nation in 50 containers of 17 tonnes each, he said. The project will supply two gas-fired power plants in Sri Lanka, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages. Petronet plans to commission a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) in Sri Lanka and hopes to gain government approval by 2025 to build the facility by 2028. He said that Petronet, India's top gas importer, is looking for more long-term gas deals. The company signed a deal for QatarEnergy to supply it with 7.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from 2028 to 2048, extending an existing agreement.

13 February: India's coal import registered a rise of 27.2 percent to 23.35 million tonnes (MT) in December, over the corresponding month of the previous fiscal. The coal ministry is aiming for zero thermal coal import by FY26. The country's coal import was 18.35 MT in the corresponding month of the previous fiscal, according to data compiled by mjunction services ltd. Of the total imports in December, non-coking coal imports stood at 15.47 MT, against 10.61 MT imported in December 2022. Coking coal import volume was 4.84 MT, against 4.71 MT imported in the same month of the previous financial year. The coal import in the April-December period of the current fiscal increased to 192.43 MT, over 191.82 MT in the year-ago period. During the April-December period of the current fiscal, non-coking coal import was at 124.37 MT, marginally lower than 126.89 MT imported during the same period in the previous financial year. Coking coal import was at 42.81 MT during April-December 2023-24, slightly up against 41.35 MT recorded for April-December 2022-23.

7 February: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister (CM) Vishnu Deo Sai announced in the Assembly scrapping of an order issued during the previous Congress government regarding the issuance of permits for coal transportation in the state through offline mode. The move will restore the old system of coal transportation by seeking transport permits online.

11 February: No subsidised power will be provided to any minister, officer or government employee in Assam, Chief Minister (CM) Himanta Biswa Sarma said. He has instructed the power department to install prepaid meters in government quarters, including residences in the ministerial colony. Sarma that he was informed by power department officials during a recent interaction that a very nominal amount on account of the monthly power bill is deducted from the salaries of ministers and senior officers.

7 February: The Jharkhand government decided to increase the limit of free electricity to 125 units from the existing 100 units per month for domestic consumers. In a review meeting with senior officials including the chief secretary, Chief Minister (CM) Champai Soren directed the energy department to prepare a proposal in this regard. The state government started the '100-unit free electricity' scheme in 2022 with an aim to reduce financial burden of the people. The scheme is applicable up to the consumption of 100 units of electricity per month for domestic connections.

11 February: Chhattisgarh has inaugurated the country's biggest solar energy plant with a battery energy storage system located near the Dhaba village in the Rajnandgaon district. This solar facility established by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Chhattisgarh Power Distribution Company provides a capacity of 100 megawatt (MW). This solar plant ensures that there will be electricity even during the night generating over five lakh units per day. This will reduce 4.5 lakh metric tons of carbon emission and boost green energy. The on-grid solar power plant set-up by the Chhattisgarh Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA) is a significant step towards sustainable energy. The plant was established on 1 February 2024. The plant features a 100 MW solar plant equipped with 2,39,000 bifacial solar panels which is producing electricity from both the sides. The plant is expected to generate power for the next seven years using solar energy. The decision to establish the first solar park in the Bairam hill area of the Rajnandgaon district was taken by the Chhattisgarh government to maximize the use of these hilly terrains for solar power.

8 February: To propel the adoption of solar energy, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has unveiled plans to transform 17 major cities of the state into solar cities including revered cities of Ayodhya and Varanasi. Under the initiative, the development of solar cities will take place first and then the government will work towards building solar villages on the same pattern. Notably, the administration has already started its efforts to establish Ayodhya as the inaugural solar city. Recently, state's Energy Minister A K Sharma underscored UP's commitment to solar energy advancement and revealed that the state is poised to emerge as a leader in the solar energy domain, with initiatives already gaining momentum. Ayodhya's solar city project encompasses the installation of over 2,500 solar-powered streetlights, enhancing the sacred city's commitment to sustainability. CM (Chief Minister) Yogi Adityanath started a solar boat service in Ayodhya. The city already boasts solar-powered amenities such as ATMs and solar trees adorning its 40 intersections, epitomising the city's embrace of renewable energy solutions. With Ayodhya spearheading the solar energy adoption, another major city Varanasi is making a foothold to install rooftop solar plants across government buildings. Under the project, Varanasi is slated to witness the installation of 25,000 rooftop solar plants, positioning it as a beacon of solar innovation.

7 February: SJVN Ltd said it has received a letter of intent (LoI) from Gujarat Urja Vias Nigam Ltd to set up a 200 megawatt (MW) solar power project. The tentative cost of construction and development of this project is INR11 billion, SJVN chairman and managing director (CMD) Geeta Kapur said. The ground-mounted solar project shall be developed by SJVN subsidiary SJVN Green Energy Ltd (SGEL) anywhere in India through an EPC contract. The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) shall be executed with GUVNL after the adoption of the tariff by GERC (Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission), it said. The project is expected to generate 508.4 million units in the first year after commissioning and the projected cumulative energy generation over a period of 25 years is 11,836.28 million units.

13 February: OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) stuck to its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2024 and 2025 and raised its economic growth forecasts for both years saying there was further upside potential. The OPEC said world oil demand will rise by 2.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 and by 1.85 million bpd in 2025. A further boost to economic growth could give additional tailwind to oil demand. OPEC's 2024 demand growth forecast is already higher than that of other forecasters such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), although the wider OPEC+ alliance is still cutting output to support the market. For this year, OPEC's expectation of oil demand growth is much more than the expansion of 1.24 million bpd so far forecast by the IEA. The IEA, which represents industrialised countries, is scheduled to update its forecasts. OPEC and the IEA have clashed in recent years over issues such as long-term demand and the need for investment in new supply. The IEA sees oil demand peaking by 2030 as the world shifts to cleaner energy, a view OPEC dismisses.

12 February: United States (US) oil output from top shale-producing regions will rise in March to its highest in four months, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Production from the top basins will rise by nearly 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.7 million bpd, its highest since December, the EIA said. Oil output in the Permian basin, the largest US shale field spread across West Texas and New Mexico, was due to rise by about 14,000 bpd to 6.1 million bpd, the second highest monthly output on record after November, the EIA said. Production in the Eagle Ford in southeast Texas was due to rise nearly 4,700 bpd to 1.1 million bpd, the highest since September, the EIA said. In the Bakken, output was set to rise by about 3,000 bpd to 1.2 million bpd, the highest since December.

12 February: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Middle East economies were lagging below growth projections due to oil production cuts and the Israel-Gaza conflict, even as the global economic outlook remained resilient. In a regional economic report last month, the IMF revised its GDP growth forecast for the Middle East and North Africa down to 2.9 percent this year, lagging below October projections, due in part to short term oil production cuts and the conflict in Gaza.

8 February: French energy giant TotalEnergies is seeking to sell its minority share in a major Nigerian onshore oil joint venture, following Shell's divestment, CEO (chief executive officer) Patrick Pouyanne said. The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), in which TotalEnergies holds a 10 percent stake, has struggled with hundreds of onshore oil spills as a result of theft, sabotage and operational issues that led to costly repairs and high-profile lawsuits over the years. TotalEnergies is the latest international oil company seeking to withdraw from Nigeria's onshore sector after decades of operations. But the French group, which produced a total of 219,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023 in Nigeria, remains a major operator of offshore fields in the West African country. It announced the start-up of the Akpo West oilfield located 135 kilometres off the coast.

12 February: Faced with stubbornly high Russian gas imports as the war in Ukraine rages on, Austria is seeking to take more radical steps, including ending energy company OMV's long-term contract to buy gas from Gazprom, Austria's Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler said. Having long sought to maintain close ties with nearby Russia, Austria sought to end its decades-long dependency on affordable Russian gas soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, scrambling to find alternative providers. Gewessler said the Russian share of Austria's gas imports actually increased in December to a new record of 98 percent from 76 percent the month before, even if the total volume of imports fell slightly.

9 February: The Russian government has extended a permit for its Yamal LNG plant to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to German nationalised gas importer and trader SEFE until 31 December 2040. Russia banned trade with a number of companies including Gazprom Germania in 2022, but a year later the government made a special dispensation for the company to allow the LNG sales until the end of 2024. The decision to extend the permission was published as Russia's largest liquefied natural gas producer Novatek is facing sanctions and delays at its new Arctic LNG 2 project.

8 February: Germany will receive its first supplies of pipeline natural gas from Algeria under a medium-term contract signed between a subsidiary of trader VNG AG and oil and gas firm Sonatrach, the companies said. This makes VNG the first German company to purchase pipeline gas from Algeria. Germany has been forced to seek new suppliers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 ended Germany's decades of reliance on Russian gas. Algeria's gas production at 106 billion cubic meters per year, according to Sonatrach.

7 February: British energy supplier Centrica has agreed to purchase 1 million metric tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Spain's Repsol between 2025 and 2027, Centrica said. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent in the South of England.

13 February: Asia's imports of seaborne thermal coal eased from record highs in January as top buyers China and India saw arrivals ease. However, there was strength in Japan and South Korea, which helped drive some divergence in prices between the high-energy coal preferred by the third- and fourth-biggest importers in Asia, and the lower quality fuel sought by China and India. Asia seaborne imports of thermal coal, used mainly to generate electricity, dropped to 77.65 million metric tonnes in January, according to commodity analysts Kpler data. China's January imports of seaborne thermal coal slipped to 27.92 million tons from December's all-time peak of 31.59 million, but were still 34 percent above the 20.86 million from January 2023. China's appetite for imported coal has been fuelled by strong demand for thermal generation amid lower output from hydropower, as well as by a price advantage compared to domestic coal prices. The main grades imported by China are lower-energy coal from Indonesia and mid-rank fuel from Australia.

13 February: United States (US) energy regulators have launched a review of the performance of the bulk power system during recent winter storms in January that brought Arctic air across much of North America, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said. Elliott was the name given to the system that brought frigid cold and blowing winds, knocking out power for more than 1.5 million homes and businesses across the US in December 2022. In November 2023, the US energy regulators urged lawmakers to fill a regulatory blind spot to maintain reliable supply of natural gas during extreme cold weather that was highlighted by an inquiry into power outages during Elliott.

8 February: German gas-fired electricity generation jumped to its highest levels in two years in January as power firms dialled up output to compensate for the closure of the country's nuclear reactors and meet higher heating demand during a cold snap last month. The 8.74 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity generated from gas-fired power stations was the highest since January 2022, according to think tank Ember, which was just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to the severing of gas pipeline flows to Europe's largest gas consumer and economy. Gas-powered generation was 13 percent above January 2023 levels, and helped lift Germany's total electricity generation to its highest level in a year. Higher gas generation also lifted natural gas' share of Germany's electricity generation mix to 18.6 percent, the highest since early 2021, which indicates that German power firms remain reliant on fossil fuels for electricity production despite ongoing energy transition efforts. While German power producers lifted generation from gas power plants in January, use of coal-fired generation remains below previous levels. Coal-fired electricity production in January was 10.83 TWh, which was down 29 percent from January 2023 and around 22 percent below the average coal generation levels of 2022.

8 February: China's National Development and Reform Council (NDRC) is moving to refine the pricing mechanisms for services essential to stabilising power supply in markets increasingly dependent on wind and solar power, in a fresh step toward creating a national electricity market by 2030. NDRC said it would focus on optimising pricing mechanisms for standby capacity, frequency modulation and so called peak shaving - which are ancillary services essential to maintaining reliable electricity supply. The peak shaving market allows power companies to buy power from quick-ramping sources such as energy storage and flexible coal plants, to help them meet spikes in demand. Frequency regulation helps maintain normal frequency on the grid, a function that can be performed by battery storage systems and generators such as coal- and gas-fired plants. The ancillary services rule is among a series of basic documents setting out the rules for a national electricity market by 2025, with the market's start targeted for 2030.

9 February: European Union (EU) countries voted to pass a law to reduce emissions from trucks, after late demands by Germany had threatened to sink the policy. The move is the latest in a string of last-minute upsets to European Union (EU) laws, caused by disputes within Germany's three-way coalition government. The law, which will enforce a 90 percent cut in CO (carbon dioxide) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles by 2040, still needs approval from the EU Parliament to enter into force. To win Germany's backing, EU countries agreed to add a preamble to the law which said the European Commission would consider developing rules to register trucks running on COneutral fuels, which could count towards the targets, diplomats said.

8 February: Britain's biggest bank HSBC has partnered with Google to finance fast-growing climate technology firms behind some of the world's most promising solutions to global climate change. Under terms of the partnership, HSBC will look to provide financing to companies cherry-picked by the US technology giant to join its Google Cloud Ready-Sustainability programme. Scaling technologies that can help the corporate world move more quickly to a low-carbon economy dominated the COP28 climate talks in Dubai in December, and is a crucial part of most banks' efforts to drive a global push to cut emissions.

8 February: Australia experienced its eighth-warmest year in 2023, with the influence of climate change pushing average temperatures almost 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1961-1990 average, the weather bureau said. Last year's extreme weather swings took Australia from widespread flooding and the coolest January since 2002 through the hottest southern hemisphere winter and early spring and driest three months on record to end with heavy rainfall as summer got underway. Forecasters warn that climate change will make Australia hotter and increase the severity of weather extremes. The bureau said that globally 2023 was the warmest year on record, with ocean temperatures at their highest ever since April and the extent of Antarctic sea ice at a record low for much of the year. For most of 2023, Australia was in the grip of an El Nino weather phenomenon - a warming of the Pacific Ocean waters along the equator off the coast of South America that typically causes hot, dry weather in Australia and Southeast Asia.

On the Borouge Borealis transaction, there are reports that the talks are stalling with ADNOC, what's your latest expectation for an agreement to be reached? Thank you for the invite to the CMD in June. Do you think a conclusion can be reached by then? And if not, what in the strategy do you feel the market needs to be updated on in June this year?

Answer by Alfred Stern:

We are still in ongoing negotiations with ADNOC on such a potential combination with an open-ended outcome to those negotia- tions. We are negotiating in the best interest of OMV and all of the shareholders of OMV.

The industrial logic of the deal is clear to everybody, but the main conditions, the key conditions for such an agreement need to be accepted by both ADNOC and OMV. We remain that the framework for OMV for such a potential combination is that we have equal shares and an equal partnership in such a potential combination and can use this as a growth platform. As you may imagine, of course, we are also interested to conclude this as soon as possible, and we will do the best possible to come to a conclusion in due time.

On M&A activity outside of the Borouge and Borealis. Are you planning for net disposals this year, and in which direction might they come?

Answer by Reinhard Florey:

The disposal that dominates at the moment is clearly the sale of our Malaysian business. This deal has been signed, and we are expecting the deal to close either late Q2 or in Q3. We have also seen that there has been a conclusion of the second part of this field. So we are expecting that to be relatively smooth and in a timely way.

We have announced the magnitude of that deal, so that will more or less have a cash consideration in the magnitude of some USD 900 mn. With this deal, we will deconsolidate about USD 100 mn of cash in the company, so that will be a net cash inflow of about USD 800 mn.

When it comes to the second deal that we have been talking about, New Zealand. Transaction is currently on hold. We are not seeing that is the right environment, right point of time to continue but this is not off, so we are expecting that to come again in the next one to two years when we are seeing a positive environment and of course, positive development of these great fields that we have in New Zealand. So far, they are still in the portfolio and positively contributing to the result.

Other than that, we are not expecting that there are any kind of major disposals in this year. You'll always find some small adjustments within the portfolio but nothing now to talk about.",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.3019607843137255,453470545,17,https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,

As the conflict in Ukraine continues to pose geopolitical challenges, Europe finds itself at a critical juncture in ensuring its energy security. In this tumultuous landscape, the significance of the Neptun Deep Black Sea project (led by OMV Petrom and the Romanian state-owned company Romgaz) emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards enhanced energy independence and stability for the continent. Neptun Deep is the largest natural gas project in the Black Sea, with an investment of €4 billion- writes Irene Max.

Located in the vast depths of the Black Sea, the Neptun Deep gas field (includes an area of 7,500sq. km situated around 160km from the shore) represents a promising opportunity for Europe todiversify its energy sources and reduce its reliance on volatile regions. Spearheaded by Romania's offshore exploration efforts, in partnership with international energy companies, this ambitious project holds the potential to significantly bolster Europe's energy resilience.

Against the backdrop of the Ukrainian conflict, the importance of Neptun Deep cannot be overstated. The ongoing turmoil has underscored the vulnerability of traditional energy supply routes, exposing Europe to potential disruptions and geopolitical maneuvers. By tapping into domestic resources and leveraging the vast reserves of the Black Sea, Europe can insulate itself from external pressures and safeguard its energy security.

Regional cooperation and stability

Beyond its immediate economic and strategic benefits, Neptun Deep project holds the potential to foster regional cooperation and stability. By engaging neighboring countries (Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, Moldova) in energy partnerships, Europe can promote dialogue and collaboration, mitigating tensions and fostering a conducive environment for peace and prosperity. However, realizing the full potential of Neptun Deep requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders. Romanian Government provides all the necessary regulatory framework and incentives to facilitate investment and development.

Hungary is interested in the possibility of importing gas from offshore production from the Black Sea. Furthermore, Péter Szijjártó, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, stated, in Bucharest, that ""we're going to look at the Neptun Deep project as a big chance for us to diversify our energy sources, so we want to take advantage of as much gas as we can import from this source.""So, for Hungary, Neptun Deep means also assuring energy independence, by reducing imports from Russia.

Neptun Deep project aligns with the European Union's broader strategy of promoting sustainable energy practices and reducing carbon emissions. As the world transitions towards cleaner energy sources, natural gas remains a crucial component of the energy mix, serving as a bridge towards a more renewable future. By investing in projects like Neptun Deep, Europe can ensure a reliable supply of natural gas while simultaneously advancing its climate objectives.

Neptun Deep is of particular importance not only for Romania, but also for Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. Also, the success of Neptun Deep is important for the transformation of Bulgaria from an energy-dependent country to one capable of ensuring its own consumption. But, the exploitation of gas reserves in the Romanian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) may be endangered by Russia's hybrid activities. Romania's energy infrastructure development underline the need for Romania's NATO and EU allies to comprehend the energy and political implications of the Neptun Deep exploitation in this particular regional context.

Romania fully supports the Neptun Deep project on all levels. From a legislative point of view, Romania has generated a transparent and predictable framework to ensure the progress and success of the project. Moreover, governmental decisions generates an attractive financial framework for the partners involved in the project.

Also, in terms of regional security, in the context of the unjustified aggression of the Russiaagainst Ukraine, Romania has started ambitious projects to ensure the security of the crew and operating ships involved in the Neptun Deep project. In this regard, it is notable that Romaniahas developed new endowment programs for unmanned systems and ISR capabilities.

Between Russia's hybrid activities and environmental NGOs actions

Besides Russia's hybrid activities, there are also some environmental NGos that could threaten European energy security and resilience. Without solid proofs, environmental NGOs implies that the Neptun Deep project presents a series of notable risks, from threatening vulnerable species in the Black Sea to intensifying the effects of climate change. But they remain voiceless and cloudy about the financial network that funds their actions and that has contrary interests regarding European energy security and resilience.

In this sense, the question arises whether the actions of those environmental NGOs are justified or only work for interest groups to block European initiatives in providing energy.

Conclusion

Neptun Deep Black Sea project represents a vital lifeline for European energy security amidst the uncertainties of the Ukrainian conflict. By harnessing the vast reserves of the Black Sea and diversifying its energy sources, Europe can reduce its dependence on volatile regions and bolster its resilience against geopolitical disruptions. Now more than ever, the imperative for action is clear: Europe must seize the opportunity presented by Neptun Deep to safeguard its energy future and ensure a more stable and prosperous tomorrow.

The success of gas exploitation in the Neptun Deep perimeter will encourage OMV Petrom to start similar actions to build critical energy infrastructure in Bulgarian waters (gas exploitation in the Khan Asparuh perimeter), meaning the removal of Russia's energy blackmail against countries such as Moldova or Bulgaria.",eureporter.co,news,EU Reporter,,0.3490196078431373,453465773,5,https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0574-1000x600.jpeg,

LONGi Solar Technologie GmbH, a German subsidiary of Chinese solar PV solutions supplier LONGi Green Energy Technology, and electrical equipment manufacturer Shanghai Electric have withdrawn from the auction following an in-depth investigation launched by the Commission under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR), the Commission said in a statement on Monday.

You can download the 2024 Renewable energy in Southeast Europe report here

The FSR, which took effect at mid-2023, allows the Commission to address distortions caused by foreign subsidies in order to ensure a level playing field for all companies operating in the EU.

The new rules are part of European Union's efforts to reduce dependence on cheaper Chinese wind and solar tech. The Commission has already launched several probes into Chinese firms over state subsidies.

The Commission will now drop its investigation after the companies withdrew from the tender, it said. The tender for the solar plant project, which is partially financed by the EU Modernisation Fund, was launched by Romanian company Parc Fotovoltaic Rovinari Est. It is jointly owned by Romania's top oil and gas group OMV Petrom [BSE:SNP] and state-owned electricity producer Complexul Energetic Oltenia. The tendered contract is valued at 375 million euro ($404.7 million).

""Solar power is vital for Europe's economic security. We are massively investing in the installation of solar panels to decrease our carbon emissions and energy bills - but this should not come at the expense of our energy security, our industrial competitiveness and European jobs. The Foreign Subsidies Regulation is ensuring that foreign companies which participate in the European economy do so by abiding to our rules on fair competition and transparency,"" said Thierry Breton, commissioner for internal market.

Last month, the Commission said it launched an investigation into the potentially market distortive role of foreign subsidies given to the two companies following notifications by the companies that they had already been granted at least 4 million euro in foreign financial contributions from at least one third country in the prior three years. Such notifications are mandated under the EU's FSR when the estimated value of the tendered contract exceeds 250 million euro.",seenews.com,news,See News,,0.2078431372549019,453462085,1,https://cdn.aiidatapro.net/media/00/96/89/t780x490/00968941c366f405991fcf076699da0818e79c41.jpg,eng-9563287

The measure is intended to hamper the logistics of Russian gas exports from the Arctic, which during the winter months requires the use of ice-breaking LNG carriers. These ships, which are scarce due to their high production, maintenance and operating costs, deliver the LNG they carry to European ports for subsequent transport by conventional LNG carriers to the Asian market, especially China.

The sanctions, therefore, do not reduce the volumes of natural gas supplied to the EU and should not have a significant impact on European benchmark prices. Yet it is a move that will reduce Russia's export revenues and paves the way for a ban on Russian LNG imports to the EU by 2027, in line with the targets set out in REPowerEU.

Why are transshipment services important?

From November to June, during the Arctic winter season, LNG that is exported from the Yamal project needs to use ice-breaking vessels to access international markets. The port where the Yamal LNG terminal is located, Sabetta, is inaccessible to conventional vessels during these months as it is surrounded by frozen waters. At present, there are only 15 icebreakers in operation, and they are mostly operated by Western shipping lines (OMV, Seapeak and Dynagas) that are well established, reputable and therefore compliant with international sanctions. To optimise the voyages of these specialised vessels, the natural gas they carry is transferred to conventional LNG tankers in warm water ports.

These transhipment services, essential for Russian LNG logistics, take place mainly in Zeebrugge, Belgium, and Montoir-de-Bretagne, France, in order to access the Asian market. In winter, permanent darkness and ice in the Arctic Ocean render it impossible for LNG tankers, even icebreakers, to reach Asian markets through the Bering Strait. This forces shipments to be re-routed through European ports servicing LNG from Yamal. Unlike crude oil transhipments, the technical specification of LNG transhipment operations means that they must be carried out in specialised ports.

As a result, Russian LNG exported to Asia during winter relies on EU port services specifically designed for these operations. Currently, Fluxys, the Belgian gas transport system operator, has a 20-year contract with Yamal LNG for gas transhipment at the Zeebrugge terminal, where a dedicated storage tank was built for Russian LNG operations in 2020. The Montoir-de-Bretagne terminal is also transhipping Yamal LNG through the ship-to-ship process under a 23-year contract signed by Engie that was subsequently inherited by France's TotalEnergies. Although these are lucrative contracts for these ports, their termination would have limited implications for the EU gas market. Novatek, the operator of the Yamal LNG facility, previously conducted transhipment operations outside port facilities in Norwegian fjords and continues to do so in Russian waters north of Murmansk. However, these ship-to-ship operations require calm seas and weather and do not offer the same security as European port terminals.

Why are these sanctions effective?

The fact that Yamal LNG continues to flow to Asia, China in particular, even when the Northern Arctic Route is closed for the winter, underlines the importance of contractual destination restrictions, which oblige LNG cargoes to be physically delivered to the agreed port. This explains why even now most LNG tankers avoid passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait: Russian cargoes from Yamal are making the longer and more costly journey via the Cape of Good Hope around Africa for deliveries to Asia.

Russia has built a floating terminal for such transshipments in Murmansk and Kamchatka, but US sanctions imposed on both projects in September 2023 appear to have delayed their entry into full operation. The US sanctions affect the companies operating the Murmansk floating terminal, which has prevented LNG tanker operators, mostly Western companies, from delivering or gathering LNG from the facility.

Banning transshipments in European ports will be especially disruptive for Russian LNG logistics and exports to Asia during next winter. This will be particularly relevant for Yamal LNG's contract with CNPC, whose final destination is bound to be China. Both companies will have to renegotiate the contract and, foreseeably, sell part of the LNG output during the winter months on the European market, probably with significant discounts. Other offtakers in the Yamal project, although not contractually obliged to do so, exported part of the gas to the Asian market (SEFE, Gunvor, TotalEnergies and Shell). During the winter months they will also have to redirect these volumes to the European market. It is an open question whether LNG tanker operators will be willing to take greater risks and logistical constraints by resorting to transhipments in Russian waters.

Figure 1. Long-term supply LNG Yamal contracts

In addition, Novatek is encountering problems in obtaining the services of new LNG carriers, both conventional and icebreakers, because of US sanctions. The latter have prevented the transfer of six icebreaking LNG carriers that were built at the Hanwha shipyard in South Korea. Novatek, together with Sovcomflot, had directly commissioned the construction of icebreaking LNG carriers from Russia's Zvezda shipyard in collaboration with Samsung, which subsequently abandoned the project. Sanctions are also reportedly delaying commissioning by preventing access to key Western technology. France's GTT and US-based General Electric, suppliers of some of the equipment for these LNG carriers, withdrew from Russia in 2023 because of the sanctions.

Sanctions on LNG transshipment and access to technology impose a very high cost on Russia without significantly harming EU interests. As recommended by the Agency of EU Energy Regulators, ACER, reductions in Russian LNG imports should be approached with caution, especially in light of the imminent expiry of the contract for Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine at the end of 2024. It seems more reasonable to focus efforts on limiting access to Western technology and transshipment services to Russian LNG companies, minimising the impact on the European natural gas market and maximising costs for Russian gas companies and Russian coffers.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,Elcano Royal Institute,0.0117647058823529,453427167,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/a-3-e1715730886278.jpg,eng-9562354

Benko's lawyer, Till Dunckel, dismissed the report as a falsehood without providing further details.

The dispute is not just about financial losses, as reported by DiePresse. An insider of the Nahyan family emphasized that they are less concerned with the money than with their honor. The family does not want to be seen as gullible people who allow themselves to be duped. The family felt that the route via the Austrian courts was not promising and would take too long, which is why they turned to the ICC in Paris.

Signa's mountain of debt and the role of the state fund Mubadala

The 250 million euros from the Nahyan family's private assets are in addition to the existing claims of 713 million euros asserted against Signa and Benko by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala. Mubadala had invested around EUR 323 million in Signa in January 2019 and a further EUR 175 million in August 2021. The fund is now demanding the return of the entire invested capital plus interest, as reported by the Kleine Zeitung newspaper.

The pressure on Benko is increasing. The ruling family has allegedly sent out an ""armada of people"" to collect the money from Benko. This claim that Benko had to get bodyguards was made by the German weekly newspaper Spiegel and illustrates the tense situation. However, a person familiar with the matter in Abu Dhabi pointed out that this was not the usual tone of the royal family.

Is Benko jeopardizing relations between Austria and Abu Dhabi?

Former Federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz had always maintained good relations with Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan and even gave a Lipizzaner stallion to his daughter as a gift in March 2019. Such symbolic gestures illustrate the close relationship between Austria and Abu Dhabi, which could now be put to the test by Benko's financial difficulties, as reported by DiePresse.

Abu Dhabi, the richest emirate in the United Arab Emirates, has had close economic ties with Austria and its companies, such as the OMV subsidiary Borealis, for many years. However, the Signa insolvency and the money lost as a result could put a strain on these relationships. The Nahyan family, which has assets estimated at 280 billion euros, not only invests in shares in energy and tech companies but also in projects such as soccer clubs and fashion brands.

A fragile balancing act

The pressure on René Benko, the former top manager and founder of the Signa Group, is increasing. Several lawsuits are already underway against the company's top management, and now the royal family of Abu Dhabi is also demanding its invested money back. The former business partners feel cheated and are demanding their money. A confidant said, as reported by ""DiePresse"", that the sheiks are more concerned with the principle than the money.

Benko's situation is becoming increasingly difficult as he has to find the lost money. The ICC in Paris is to decide on the claims, with the accusation that Benko asked for more money when Signa's insolvency was already foreseeable. A quick arbitration ruling in Paris could further increase the pressure on Benko and put relations between Austria and Abu Dhabi to the test.

The future of relations between Austria and Abu Dhabi

The close economic cooperation between Austria and Abu Dhabi could be jeopardized by the scandal surrounding René Benko. Although Austria continues to strive to maintain good relations with the rich emirate, the loss of millions of euros and the associated breach of trust could have long-term consequences. How this situation develops will not only affect Benko's future but also diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries.",vindobona.org,news,Vindobona.org | Vienna International News,,-0.08235294117647063,453379557,1,https://www.vindobona.org/images/text/benko-and-kurz-in-uae-2019.jpg,

Image by Leonid Eremeychuk via iStock

Malaysia's Sapura Energy Berhad joint venture companies have secured contracts from Petróleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) to provide the services and charter of six pipe-laying support vessels (PLSVs).

The contracts are for a term of three years, beginning on different mobilization dates for each of the PLSVs, with the longest dated contract lasting up to 2028, Sapura Energy said in a bourse announcement. The total value of the contracts is $1.8 billion.

The scope of work includes the provision of subsea engineering, installation and other services, by utilizing the PLSVs in Brazilian waters. Sapura Energy said the PLSVs will perform all operations required for the installation of flexible pipes, electric-hydraulic umbilical and power cables, new or used, such as loading, unloading, laying, connection between spans, vertical connection (first and second end) on submarine equipment, installation of submarine equipment and hydrostatic test, in a maximum water depth of 9842.5 feet (3000 meters).

Sapura Energy, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sapura Offshore Sdn Bhd, holds 50 percent equity interests in the joint venture companies.

Restructuring Progress

In March, Sapura Energy and its 22 wholly owned subsidiaries were granted new convening and restraining orders by the High Court of Malaya for a period of three months, beginning March 11.

The orders, sanctioned under the Companies Act 2016, will enable each of the scheme companies to summon meetings with creditors, to consider and approve a proposed scheme of arrangement and compromise as part of the company's group-wide debt restructuring plan. The restraining orders will assist the scheme companies to engage with creditors without being disrupted by the threat of litigation.

In its application to the Court, Sapura Energy stated in an earlier statement that ""significant progress in the restructuring exercise has been made"". Its multi-currency lenders have provided the requisite Approval-in-Principle for the proposed restructuring scheme while claims from its trade creditors under the Proof of Debt process have been fully reviewed.

Sapura Energy's debt restructuring exercise aims to address its multi-currency financing of approximately $2.28 billion (MYR 10.8 billion) and outstanding payments to trade creditors amounting to about $0.32 billion (MYR 1.5 billion).

Sapura Energy Chairman Dato' Mohammad Azlan Abdullah said, ""As previously announced, we appreciate the Approval-in-Principle from our financiers for the PRS. This was a major point that will enable us to move ahead with the restructuring"".

In April, TotalEnergies SE announced the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent stake in Malaysian independent gas producer and operator SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn from Sapura Upstream Assets Sdn Bhd (SUA) for $530 million.

The energy major in January signed an agreement with OMV AG to acquire its 50 percent interest in SapuraOMV for $903 million.

After the completion of both transactions, TotalEnergies would own 100 percent of SapuraOMV, TotalEnergies said in a separate statement.

SapuraOMV's main assets are its 40 percent operated interest in block SK408 and 30 percent operated interest in block SK310, both located offshore Sarawak in Malaysia.",rigzone.com,news,Rigzone,,0.3803921568627451,453207955,1,https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Sapura-Energy-Bags-Pipelaying-Contracts-from-Petrobras-176706-582x327.webp,

At least that happened until today, but Simyo already has an answerand it is also different from that of its rivals.

If the philosophy of low cost is to adjust prices to a minimum, Simyo does so by recovering a lowest fiber speed, but it is still enough for a multitude of needs. And to compensate, it offers more gigabytes on the mobile than its rivals at similar prices.

Simyo once again offers all its fiber and mobile combinations, in addition to the usual speeds of 300, 600 and 1,000 Mbps, as well with fiber at 100 Mbpswhich allows reduce the price of access to your combinations by 3 euros per month.

Thus, Simyo manages to offer a differential offer in the market, betting everything on gigabytes, but allowing the price to be optionally reduced by using a somewhat slower fiber, or removing free minutes from the mobile. And its gigabytes are the only ones on the market that accumulate over three months.

Focusing on the cheapest rates on the market with fiber and mobile with unlimited minutes, Simyo manages to offer more gigabytes of access and for less money of what it costs on O2, Lowi and even on Digi. The main offers in May 2024 are as detailed in the comparative graph:

There were over 10,000 orders placed by retail investors, amounting to over RON 500 million (100 mln), as of Friday, May 10, at 15:15.

The Premier Energy IPO is the first major IPO taking place on the Bucharest Stock Exchange after the Hidroelectrica (H2O) IPO in June 2023, which was the biggest listing in Romania's history.

Premier Energy and its majority shareholder Emma Capital are looking to draw up to EUR 160 million from BVB investors through the sale of new and existing shares. The majority of money raised in the IPO will go into the company through a capital increase and will finance the group's development plans in Romania.

Premier Energy's IPO has stirred high interest among investors on the Bucharest Stock Exchange due to several factors:

Diversified portfolio in the energy sector

Premier Energy is one of the fastest-growing players in the energy sector in Romania and Southeastern Europe (SEE) with a diversified portfolio, which includes gas distribution assets in Romania, electricity distribution in Moldova, and renewable energy assets in Romania. The group has accelerated its expansion recently with the acquisition of CEZ Vanzare, one of the biggest electricity suppliers in Romania, and new acquisitions of renewable energy assets.

Attractive valuation compared with BVB peers

The pricing of Premier Energy's IPO is also attractive when compared with the valuation of energy companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. Considering the maximum IPO price of RON 21.5 and the maximum amount of sales that could be sold in the IPO, Premier Energy could be valued at EUR 562 million, which stands for a P/E ratio (price/earnings) of 7.1 based on last year's net profit of EUR 79 mln. Factoring in the impact of the CEZ Vanzare acquisition, the P/E ratio is even lower at 5.65, based on a pro-forma net profit of EUR 99.5 mln. Also, the P/B ratio (price/book value) post-IPO is close to 1, which means that the company's valuation is almost equal to the net value of its assets.

The top 5 energy companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (Hidroelectrica, OMV Petrom, Romgaz, Nuclearelecrica and Electrica) are trading at an average P/E ratio of 7.95 and an average P/B ratio of 1.49 considering their profits for 2023.

Discount for retail investors

The Premier Energy IPO also offered a 5% discount to retail investors who placed their subscriptions in the first three days of the offer. This is an important incentive for investors as they will already have a potential gain even before the shares start trading on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. For example, if the IPO is priced at the top of the price range - RON 21.5 per share, retail investors who placed their orders in the first three days will get the shares at RON 20.425. If the shares start trading on BVB at RON 21.5, these investors will already have a 5% profit from selling their shares.

The downside is that the retail tranche is already oversubscribed and, as a result, the investors will get fewer shares than they were planning to.

The Premier Energy IPO started on May 8 and will end on May 15. Citigroup Global Markets Europe, UniCredit Bank and Wood & Company Financial Services are the Joint Global Coordinators of the IPO. Alpha Bank Romania and BT Capital partners are Joint Bookrunners and Banca Transilvania is the distribution group.",romania-insider.com,news,Romania Insider,,0.4431372549019608,453040075,1,https://cdn.romania-insider.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_large_image/public/2024-04/premier_energy_company_photo.jpg,

Still, many of the them did better than analysts expected as elevated oil prices boosted earnings through the quarter. For some, increased oil-and-gas production also shielded earnings from weaker natural-gas prices. Shell, Equinor, Galp and OMV all exceeded consensus by more than 20%, while BP and Neste were the only two to miss consensus forecasts.

-- Italy's Eni kicked off the reporting season with 1.58 billion euro ($1.70 billion) in adjusted net profit, slightly topping a company-compiled consensus forecast of EUR1.56 billion. This puts the Rome-based company on track to exceed its full-year earnings guidance as it works to increase upstream production, it said. However, the quarterly result was still a marked drop from the EUR2.91 billion it reported a year prior. Profit was driven partly by higher earnings from its Plenitude subsidiary, and as it produced 5% more hydrocarbons through the quarter. On the back of the result, it raised its full-year buyback by 45% to EUR1.6 billion. Shares closed down 1.8% on the day of the report.

-- Norwegian major Equinor adjusted operating income fell to $7.53 billion from $11.92 billion, but was still above the $7.20 billion forecast by a company-compiled consensus. This beat was driven by a 1.6% rise in production to 2.16 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day in the first quarter on a strong operational performance, including increased capacity and output and new wells coming onstream. Shares ended up 2.5% on the day.

-- Spain's Repsol beat consensus when it reported an adjusted income of EUR1.27 billion versus a forecast EUR1.19 billion, based on a company-provided survey, buoyed by strong oil prices and lower taxes in the quarter. However, a year prior it reported EUR1.89 billion in adjusted earnings. Its cash flow from operations of EUR1.36 billion beat consensus by 40%, according to Bank of America. Its production of oil and gas declined 2.9% through the quarter. Shares initially traded 2.1% lower when market opened on the day of the report, but ended unchanged at closing.

-- One of two European majors to miss market expectations, Finnish Neste booked a comparable net profit of EUR256 million, significantly below a forecast of EUR400 million. This was a 53% drop from a year prior and driven by a weaker renewable-diesel market as earnings from its renewable-products segment tumbled 42%. Following the result, the company said that president and chief executive Matti Lehmus will be stepping down in November. Shares fell 13% on the day of the results publication.

-- Paris-based TotalEnergies beat expectations with $5.72 billion in net profit versus $4.88 billion, up 3% on year, making it one of only two European majors to book rising profit in the quarter. The company primarily credited the result to elevated oil prices and refining margins, offsetting the impact from low natural-gas prices and a 2% decline in hydrocarbon production. TotalEnergies said it will buy back $2 billion shares on the back of the results. Shares closed 2.1% higher on the day.

-- Portugal's Galp Energia booked an underlying replacement-cost profit of EUR337 million, ahead of consensus' EUR262 million and 35% higher than a year earlier. It credited resilient levels of production from its upstream segment, although these fell slightly to 116,000 from 120,000 BOE a day, dragged by maintenance in its Brazilian operations. However, analysts paid most attention to Galp's commentary on its Namibia exploration, which it called a potential major commercial discovery after finding significant light-oil columns. It plans on drilling four appraisal wells early next year at the latest. Shares initially jumped 4.5% in early trading, but ultimately closed down 0.9% on the day of the results.

-- Austrian OMV's net income on a current-cost-of-supply basis of EUR696 million comfortably beat a consensus estimate of EUR572 million, thanks to better-than-expected results from its gas marketing & power and chemicals segments. Last year, it reported $1.025 billion. Its energy segment's operating result declined 26% to EUR1.05 billion due to substantially lower natural-gas prices and a fall in hydrocarbon production of around 6.8% to 352,000 BOE a day. Shares closed up 2.5% on the day.

-- British giant Shell exceeded expectations across the board, led by adjusted earnings at $7.73 billion--a 20% beat to expectations--, driven by stronger oil-and-gas trading and its liquefied natural-gas output hitting the top-end of the guided range. However, this was still a marked decline from last year's $9.65 billion. Shell produced 10% more oil and gas during the quarter, mainly due to the Prelude platform offshore Australia resuming operations. A strong chemicals result also boosted the earnings beat. Shell maintained its quarterly buyback at $3.5 billion. Shares finished the day 1.9% higher.

-- Rounding off the reporting season, BP missed expectations with an underlying replacement-cost profit of $2.72 billion versus consensus' $2.87 billion, making the British company and Neste the only two to perform worse than anticipated by market watchers. The result was dragged by lower prices for oil and gas sold, an outage at its biggest oil refinery and significantly weaker fuels margin. Meanwhile, the company managed to ramp up its output of hydrocarbons by 7.6% during the quarter. Shares closed 1.2% down.

OMV and Borealis have entered into long-term feedstock supply agreements for their recycling facilities with TOMRA Feedstock, a subsidiary of leading sorting technology producer TOMRA. These agreements ensure a consistent supply of sustainable and high-quality raw materials for OMV Group's recycling operations. OMV will process feedstock supplied from TOMRA Feedstock plants in its ReOil® plants in Austria, while Borealis will process feedstock produced by TOMRA at its mechanical recycling operations in Europe. The feedstock will be produced from mixed post-consumer plastic material otherwise lost to landfill and incineration at a first-of-its-kind sorting facility currently being developed by TOMRA in Germany. By contributing to the OMV Group's strategic targets of producing circular products and solutions, these agreements play a crucial role in closing the loop in plastics to accelerate the transition to a circular economy.

TOMRA is a global leader in sensor-based sorting systems for metal and waste recycling and is currently building a sorting plant in Germany that will have an input capacity of 80,000 metric tons per annum and be operational at the end of 2025. TOMRA Feedstock has pioneered an innovative process that transforms pre-sorted mixed post-consumer plastic waste - materials that would otherwise end up in incineration - sorted into clean fractions of specific polymer types. These fractions can then be further processed in mechanical and chemical recycling plants such as those run by OMV and Borealis.

OMV has signed a long-term contract for the supply by TOMRA Feedstock of chemical recycling feedstock. This feedstock will be used for OMV's self-developed and patented ReOil® technology for chemical recycling - thereby replacing virgin polyolefins. This will make a significant contribution to meeting recycling targets.

Daniela Vlad, OMV Executive Vice President Chemicals & Materials: ""This long-term supply agreement will provide feedstock for our ReOil® technology, which in turn will transform it into high-quality sustainable raw materials for plastics production. In this way, we are making a significant contribution to the creation of a circular economy for plastics.""

Borealis will be using the feedstock at its operations based on Borealis' Borcycle™ M technology, which transforms polyolefin-based post-consumer waste into high-performance polymers suitable for demanding applications in industries including automotive, energy, infrastructure, healthcare, appliances and consumer products.

Craig Arnold, Borealis Executive Vice President Polyolefins, Circular Economy Solutions and Innovation & Technology: ""This agreement is another tangible step forward on Borealis' commitment to increasing the share of recycled content across a wide range of high-performance products. Our customers will be able to expand on the use of value-added, recycled plastics within their portfolios.""

Volker Rehrmann, Executive Vice President and Head of TOMRA Recycling: ""This agreement shows what's possible when key players in the value chain come together to make a truly significant impact in the market. With our technology, we have the ability to recover post-consumer plastics that would have otherwise been lost to incineration. This is valuable material that should be given at least a second life. We look forward to working with OMV and Borealis in making a big contribution toward closing the circularity gap for plastics.""

OMV operates a ReOil® pilot plant in Schwechat, Austria, and a new ReOil® plant with a capacity of 16,000 metric tons per year is currently under construction at the same site. Like the existing pilot plant, the new plant will have International Sustainability and Carbon certification (ISCC PLUS). Further information can be found here.

She said she'd tried to fix her license issue for months, but couldn't get through.

Latrice Johnson of Baton Rouge, Louisiana is one of several drivers who went to the media to complain about their inability to contact and resolve driver's license issues with the state's Office of Motor Vehicles (OMV).

Johnson had her license suspended after defaulting on a payment for a speeding ticket - which was the issue she was attempting to remedy.

""I've been unable to get back on the payment plan because I've been calling OMV, and there's no answer,"" she told ABC affiliate WBRZ in 2022

She said she tried to get a hold of someone for months, but each time she called, she'd receive an automated message saying:

""We are sorry, but due to a higher-than-normal call volume, we cannot take your call. Please hang up and try again. Thank you.""

Without options, Johnson knowingly drove her car without a valid license.

Eventually, she was pulled over by a state trooper for speeding, where it was discovered she was driving without a license.

In Louisiana, that means a $500 ticket.

""When he did stop me, I said, 'Oh Lord, I knew my license was suspended',"" she said.

She knew what she was doing was wrong - but she felt helpless given her countless failed attempts to contact the OMV.

She told the trooper about her issue, and he said her options were limited.

""I was instructed by the state trooper there that I have to just keep calling,"" she recalled.

Johnson said the incident was embarrassing, as she felt it wasn't her fault the OMV wasn't answering her calls.

""The officers should be more lenient, should not take your plate and embarrass you like that because it's not our fault that motor vehicles is this behind,"" she said.

Within her circle, she wasn't the only one having issues with the OMV.

""I have friends that are having the same issue,"" she said.

In March of 2023, eight months after Johnson's story aired, another story from FOX affiliate WVUE-DT was published in New Orleans regarding the same issue.

Tammy Oser told the outlet not being able to get through to the OMV could mean the end of her pediatric daycare for special needs children without being able to register her work van.

After trying to register the van online before it was due, the OMV's website flagged the van as being uninsured, despite Oser having proof.

She tried for five days calling every half-hour to contact the agency, with no luck.

""These are children that have trachs, traumatic brain injuries, we have a child who has juvenile ALS, I have children with seizure disorders, I have lots of ill children,"" she said.

""Because if I can't go pick them up, then the children don't get their physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, and speech.""

One man, Clifton Carson, tried for three weeks to renew his commercial vehicle license.

Without it, he was unable to work, costing him three weeks' worth of pay.

""It took me three weeks, to call every day, leaving messages, to finally get a hold of them,"" he said.

""Sometimes, in an emergency, I need to get a piece of equipment from Point A to Point B, and because of that, my hours were cut back, because I couldn't fully fulfill my duties. Because, technically, I could not drive the truck.""

The OMV responded to the outlet's request for comment, stating that the main reason for such a slow response time was a lack of employees.

At the time of publication, the OMV spokesperson wrote that there were more than 60 job vacancies, resulting in an overload of work for current employees.",the-sun.com,news,The US Sun,Kristen Brown,-0.1607843137254902,452903187,33,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/05/DK_DMV_TICKETS_OP.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,

Or follow us on Google News!

What's the point, one may ask, of reporting on EV road trips today when they have become so common? Even the top Polish energy and EV journalist, Bartłomiej Derski, recently tweeted that same remark after doing a Poland-Croatia trip twice in two different EVs (750 miles each way) without any hassle and with plenty other EVs around him. The charm is gone. EV early adopters are no longer road heroes. All the Johns and Kates do the same trips without feeling they are doing anything out of the ordinary. Yet, most people still don't drive EVs and wonder about their capability on long trips, so I'm back reporting on another European EV trip, this time in a Ford Mustang Mach-E. Happily, the EV charging landscape in Central and Eastern Europe has improved greatly in recent years, and this trip proves it.

Tomasz Gać is the Polish EV pioneer who took the trip. He bought his first Nissan LEAF back in 2013 before almost anybody here understood the revolution looming on the horizon. Since then, he has travelled all around Europe in various electric models -- the Nissan LEAF, Nissan e-NV200, Tesla Model S, Hyundai Kona EV, and numerous other. Many a time, I recounted his adventures for CleanTechnica, including when he travelled to Sicily and Albania. Today, he is travelling in comfort in a glaringly orange Ford Mustang Mach-E GT from Poland through the Balkans to the historic city of Sparta in Greece.

I'll use this opportunity to draw some comparisons to what we remember from 2018 and what we can see today. The context is broader, as Europe has just introduced the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), setting very ambitious goals for all member states concerning deployment of charging infrastructure for both passenger and heavy-duty vehicles. While many European countries are meeting the targets defined for 2025 today, forecasts of future EV uptake suggest the infrastructure will need to quadruple. The number one challenge today seems to be accelerating the process of granting permits and fast-tracking charging hubs along TEN-T routes. Let's see what the starting point is in our subjective overview of the states on the Mustang Mach-E's way.

Slovakia's charging name is GreenWay, an unquestionable leader and a good friend of CleanTechnica for years. The first impression is that the power of most chargers is 100 kW or greater now, as compared to 2018, when 50 kW was still considered a great option. It's worth noting that many of the chargers still include ChaDeMo plugs, so older vehicles, most notably from Nissan, are still catered to.

Apart from GreenWay, there is a good coverage of other providers such as Shell, Drive&Charge, and Lidl. However, the ease of using a GreenWay roaming card naturally narrowed our search to this one option. When checking current reports on European charging targets, Slovakia looks very solid, with its infrastructure already meeting 2024 and 2025 targets. Work needs to be done, though, to meet 2026 requirements, and there seems to be no reason for concern.

Tomek's team still have vivid memories of being shouted away from a Nissan charger by an unfriendly guard, as Teslas were not allowed to use it. That was the first attempt to charge in Hungary back in 2018. The network that saved the day at the time was ... Kaufland, a chain of supermarkets with a strong policy of installing chargers next to their locations (interestingly, the location in my small town in Poland has just gotten a Kaufland charger). Anyway, these dark days are over and Hungary welcomes EV users with a good network of fast chargers, especially along motorways where most petrol stations from MOL, OMV, and Shell have a DC charger in place. Inner city areas are well covered with supermarket networks, especially Kaufland's and Lidl's.

These are serious improvement since 2018 and the shouting guard at a Nissan store. This subjective view of infrastructure rollout doesn't mean Hungary is on track with European targets. According to EAFO, Hungary is lagging behind its 2024 targets, so it needs to multiply its efforts to meet the goals for 2025 and further on.

Back in 2018, Romania only offered supermarket charging stations -- Kaufland to the rescue again. We slipped through Romania then nonetheless and now we could enjoy another easy drive, as the charging stations have multiplied with Rompetrol stations leading the way. The uptake of EVs may be slower than in other countries here, and hence it has a good result in meeting AFIR targets for 2024. Romania is doing okay today, but around the corner there is a lot of infrastructure investment to be done to keep up with the pace of new EV purchases.

Bulgaria's charging infrastructure used to be confined to the capitol of Sofia plus a few supermarket stations. It's undergone a revolution in the number of public chargers, especially in cities but less so at petrol stations. Meanwhile, sadly, the fleet of EVs remains at a very low level. That is the reason Bulgaria may be a leader in charging stations per electric vehicle but we will not call it a leader in e-mobility, at least not yet. The charging station targets for 2026 are already fulfilled. Time to bring the fleet to use the infrastructure!

Tomek and his team turned to Albania and Macedonia 6 years ago and so never got to Greece. No comparisons can be made to the situation back then, and we can only judge what's there today. Today is looking quite good. Considering the range of modern EVs, the density of charging stations appears to be sufficient. With the Mustang's 98 kW battery, you can travel everywhere at ease. The DEI Blue network seems to be the most common one, and we used it after downloading the network's PCC Blue app. That would be in line with the Greek experience of our other travelers, journalists from WysokieNapiecie.pl who travelled through Greece in 2022. Although the network was okay, the roaming services on the cards they had were unavailable. The subjectivity of our views is exposed here more than in other places. Greece is way below the European targets and may find it difficult to catch up. More pressure is needed, ideally from a growing community of EV owners.

All in all, the travelling experience is worth the effort. EV adventures are always present, especially when you decide to ask for a charging socket at every hotel or lodge you stay at. We all know nothing is better than a good night's charge from a simple wall socket. Let it drip when you enjoy your evening wine and a good sleep.

(ING) and Mizuho Bank, Ltd (Mizuho) on the financing of the innovative geothermal heating project Eavor-LoopTM in the German state of Bavaria by loan facilities of up to 130 million euros. The Canadian technology company Eavor is using its closed-loop technology for the first time on a commercial scale in the project in the town of Geretsried.

Part of the financing of the first commercial-scale Eavor-LoopTM is being built with the additional support of a 91.6 million euros grant from the EU Innovation Fund. The EIB loan comes with a guarantee by the European InvestEU-programme. The project is co-financed by JBIC, ING Bank N.V. ING and Mizuho and is insured by Japan's Export Credit Agency, Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). It qualifies as a green loan in accordance with the Loan Market Association's Green Loan Principles.

In contrast to conventional geothermal heating, the Eavor-LoopTM technology does not capture heat from subsurface water or steam reservoirs. Instead, the company drills deeply into the earth and harvests the heat directly from underground rocks. The Eavor-LoopTM system resembles a giant underground radiator. Two vertical wells are drilled to a depth of 4 500 to 5 000 metres. Then 12 pairs of horizontal laterals, 3 000 to 3 500 metres long, are drilled from the bases of each of the two wells, for a total of about 90 kilometres of drilling (about 320 to 360 kilometres for four loops). The giant radiator is then filled with fluid.

""Geothermal energy is one of the most important and still underutilised renewable energy sources. The EavorLoop technology avoids some of the risks associated with conventional geothermal projects and therefore has the potential to be a game changer in heat supply. The issues associated with the novelty of the technology in combination with the financing by international institutions with different requirements was and remains an exciting challenge for the entire team,"" comments the responsible partner Dirk Trautmann.

The Norton Rose Fulbright team was led by Munich partner Dirk Trautmann (lead, financing/energy and infrastructure projects, Head of Infrastructure Europe). He was supported by partners Dr Klaus Bader (Munich, Corporate / M&A, Head of Energy Europe), Dr Valerian von Richthofen (Düsseldorf, Energy and Infrastructure Projects, Head of Infrastructure Europe). Valerian von Richthofen (Düsseldorf, energy law), Michael Jürgen Werner (Brussels, state aid and antitrust law), Colin Rice (Singapore, hedging) and Akihiko Takamatsu (Japan, financing), counsel Timothy Nelmes (Munich, financing), senior associates Matthias Zimmermann (Munich, financing), Sebastian Eisenhut (Munich, Corporate / Due Diligence) and Mai Tezuka (Japan, Financing), as well as associates Benedict Schiller (Munich, Due Diligence / Financing), Sebastian Jeschke (Munich, Financing), Sebastian Gerber (Brussels, State Aid) and MaximVakhromov (Singapore, Hedging).

The Norton Rose Fulbright team provided comprehensive advice on reviewing and commenting on the project documents (permits, project contracts) and drafted and negotiated the complex financing agreements.

Norton Rose Fulbright's Energy team is one of the largest in the world; the German team in Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich is fully integrated into the global network. Norton Rose Fulbright is one of the global market leaders in energy law, not least because of its award-winning advice in connection with clean energy projects and climate change.

The Norwegian Offshore Directorate confirms that it has approved drilling at two blocks located in the central parts of the Barents Sea. The blocks are located in the area of Wisting, the field discovered in 2013 and believed to hold more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent.

License partners are AkerBP (35%), Equinor (35%), Petoro (20%) and Inpex Idemitsu Norge (10%).

The well drilling is due to be launched in the course of May this year and semisubmersible rig Scarabeo-8 is expected to soon set course for the area.

Wisting is located about 300 km north of the Norwegian mainland and only about 50 km south of the Arctic sea-ice edge.

Environmental organisations have strongly warned against drilling in the area, arguing that a spill could seriously harm marine life. The organisations rejoiced as the license holders in 2022 announced that they would postpone of the project investment decision.

""This is a great victory for everyone that cares about climate and the environment,"" Truls Gulowsen, leader of Friends of the Earth Norway, said following the decision.

""Time is over for the development of new major oil fields [and] we are convinced that this means the end for this horrible project,"" he underlined.

The upcoming well drilling could indicate that the environmentalists' fight with the oil companies over Wisting is not yet over.

The resources of Wisting might exceed the resources of Johan Castberg, the project currently under development and expected to start production in course of 2024.

So far, six wells have been drilled at Wisting.

The license partners originally planned to launch production at the field in 2028. It would include a circular Floating Production and Storage Unit (FPSO), not unlike the one applied in the Goliat project.

Equinor is operator of the Wisting project.

Eavor-Lite, Alberta. (Credit: Eavor Technologies Inc.)

One of the significant developments has been Chubu Electric Power's decision to participate in the Eavor-Loop project under development by Alberta (Canada) based start-up Eavor Technologies at Geretsried, Bavaria, Germany. Chubu is taking a 40% stake in Eavor Erdwärme Geretsried GmbH, the operating company for the project, and is already a shareholder in Eavor itself. Eavor holds the remaining 60% of Eavor Erdwärme Geretsried GmbH.

Eavor-Loop is a ""closed-loop"" concept for geothermal heat extraction in which a working fluid that is completely isolated from the below-ground environment is circulated in subsurface pipework, ""collecting heat from the natural geothermal gradient of the Earth via conduction.""

Eavor (pronounced ""Ever""), established in 2017, says this approach ""represents the world's first truly scalable form of clean, dispatchable, baseload capable, and flexible heat and power,"" and achieves this by ""mitigating or eliminating many of the issues that have traditionally hindered geothermal energy.""

Building on Eavor's experience with a pilot installation in Canada and the Eavor-Deep deep drilling demonstration in New Mexico, the Geretsried project will see four closed loops installed about 4500 meters underground. It will be the first commercial application of Eavor-Loop technology.

The heated circulating fluid will be used to provide district heating (64 MWt) and for power generation (8.2 MWe) via an organic Rankine cycle (ORC).

The ORC technology provider is Turboden (part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Group).

Another key supplier is pipe maker Vallourec, which previously worked with Eavor on the New Mexico demo project.

Drilling of the first loop at Geretsried started in July 2023, with ""partial commercial operations"" - completion of the first loop - expected in October 2024. The start of full-scale commercial operation, with all four loops completed, is targeted for August 2026.

This project is receiving a 91.6 million euro grant from the EU Innovation Fund.

By participating, Chubu says it plans to acquire experience in and additional knowledge of the geothermal business, with the possibility of future applications of the Eavor-Loop technology in Japan.

The project also benefits. ""Geretsried, with Chubu's involvement, changes everything,"" said John Redfern, Eavor president & CEO.

In June 2023, Eavor completed the first close of their Series B equity round. OMV led the round with a €34 million investment and entered into a commercial agreement with Eavor to pursue large-scale deployment of Eavor-Loop technology in Europe and beyond.

OMV will be focused initially on the deployment of Eavor-Loop in Austria, Romania, and Germany.

In March 2023, Eavor announced the signing of a cooperation agreement with Sonoma Clean Power for the development of up to 200 MWe of new geothermal power through the GeoZone initiative in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, California.

An Eavor-Loop entails the connection of two vertical wells with many horizontal multilateral wellbores creating a closed sealed radiator-like system.

Eavor has developed a set of technologies for economically drilling and connecting such a network of loops thousands of meters below the surface.

Successful completion of the Eavor-Deep drilling demonstration project in New Mexico was announced in January 2023.

Combined with the proof of concept demonstrated at the Derek Riddell Eavor-Lite™ demonstration facility in Alberta, Canada in 2019, the milestones reached at Eavor-Deep ""validated all the key elements required to construct and operate commercial Eavor-Loops,"" says Eavor.

The Eavor-Lite prototype facility consists of two vertical wells, joined by two multilateral legs at 2.4 km depth, connected by a pipeline at the surface. The rationale for this design, which is not intended to be commercially viable, is to build a facility that proves and demonstrates all the critical elements of Eavor's technologies at the lowest cost. The demonstration was ""designed to achieve the most efficient path to acceptance and commercialisation of the technology by facility developers and commercial financiers.""

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (who has visited the Geretsried site) has pledged to greatly increase the use of geothermal energy in Germany, envisaging tenfold expansion by 2030.

Meanwhile, in the UK, ORC technology provider Exergy International and Geothermal Engineering, developer and operator of geothermal plants, have signed a contract for the supply of a 3 MWe gross capacity ORC power plant at the United Downs site, in Cornwall. This represents the first integrated deep geothermal project in the UK. As well as 3 MW of baseload electricity, it will also deliver up to 10 MWt of zero-carbon heat to a large housing estate at Langarth Garden Village, a project being developed by Cornwall Council.

Exergy is also working with Pertamina Geothermal Energy on the development of geothermal power plant projects in Indonesia.

In Kenya, Globeleq, described as ""the leading independent power company in Africa"" and its project partner, the state-owned Geothermal Development Company, have broken ground on the 35 MW Menengai geothermal project in Nakuru County.

The $108 million Menengai project is Globeleq's first geothermal plant. It will operate and maintain the power plant once it achieves commercial operation, targeted for 2025.

Menengai is a greenfield geothermal project and part of the first phase of the wider Menengai complex, which is the second large-scale geothermal field being developed in Kenya after Olkaria. Steam will be supplied to the power plant by GDC under a 25-year project implementation and steam supply agreement. Once the plant is operational, electricity will be sold to Kenya Power, under a power purchase agreement for the same timeframe. Toyota Tsusho Corporation from Japan is the EPC contractor. Fuji Electric is manufacturing and supplying the steam turbine and generator.

The outlook for residential and commercial geothermal projects has also improved in New York, following a vote by the NY legislature to reform geothermal drilling regulations.

The vote was in particular welcomed by the New York Geothermal Energy Organization (NY-GEO), a trade association representing the geothermal heat pump industry in New York State.

Jens Ponikau, president of NY-GEO and co-owner of Buffalo Geothermal said: ""To expand the drilling depth for closed loop geothermal bore holes is an important step forward to enable geothermal systems to be installed in dense urban settings.""

The change in current regulations, which treat geothermal systems at depths greater than 500 ft as oil and gas drilling, is expected to open up opportunities for buildings with smaller footprints, and ""residential and commercial buildings not able to benefit from the energy bill savings of geothermal heat pumps now can. The ability to drill beyond 500 ft will make geothermal systems more affordable to install and accessible to more New Yorkers.""

Looking at the wider European geothermal market picture, the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC) has recently published its assessment of geothermal market developments in 2022, the 12th edition of its annual Geothermal Market Report.

In 2022, there were 142 geothermal power plants in operation with an installed capacity of about 3.5 GWe, achieving an average capacity factor of 79%, the ""highest of all electricity sources,"" notes EGEC.

In 2022, the expansion of geothermal district heating and cooling capacity persisted and by year-end, there were 395 operational systems -- an increase of 14 compared with 2021 - as well as more than 300 projects under development.

EGEC expects more than 30 wells to be drilled over the next three to five years for geothermal power plants, and more than 100 wells for heating projects.

2022 witnessed an all-time high in the sales of geothermal heat pump systems, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. With over 141 300 GHP systems installed, sales in 2022 were 17% higher than the previous year. A continuation of this upward trend has already been confirmed in the first quarter of 2023, particularly in Germany and Sweden. More than 2.19 million geothermal heat pumps are in operation in Europe.

EGEC observes that 2023 marks the 110th anniversary of the first-ever geothermal power plant, which entered operation in 1913 in Larderello, Italy. It also notes that the oldest geothermal power plant still in operation is from 1986.",nsenergybusiness.com,news,NS Business,,0.223529411764706,452856646,5,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Eavor.jpg,eng-9552487

Market Growth:

The global electric two-wheeler market is primarily being propelled by stringent government regulations aimed at reducing vehicle emissions and minimizing carbon footprints. With governments worldwide implementing strict emission norms and regularly enforcing renewals, the adoption of electric two-wheelers is gaining momentum. Favorable environmental schemes and increasing awareness among consumers about environmental issues are further driving the popularity of electric two-wheelers across all regions.

In India, for example, the introduction of Bharat Stage (BS) emission standards has played a significant role in regulating vehicle emissions. BS-IV standards, applied to new type approvals in April 2016 and all vehicle sales and registrations in April 2017, marked the implementation of evaporative emission standards for two- and three-wheelers. Subsequently, BS-VI standards, effective from April 2020, align emission limits for two-wheeled vehicles more closely with European standards, albeit with slightly relaxed criteria. These regulations significantly tighten hydrocarbon (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) values compared to existing standards and introduce independent NOx standards for two-wheelers.

The rapid acceptance of electric two-wheelers is driving the need for the development of electric charging infrastructure worldwide. This has attracted substantial funds and investments from both governments and private players across the globe. Regions like Europe are already making significant strides in electric charging infrastructure projects.

For instance, a consortium primarily comprising German carmakers is set to launch ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations, with plans to establish a pan-European network of 400 stations by 2020. Additionally, IONITY, a joint venture involving BMW AG, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Co, and Volkswagen with its Audi and Porsche brands, aims to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway, and Austria. These stations, located approximately 120 km apart, are established in collaboration with Tank & Rast, Circle K, and OMV.

The Austrian Centre for the Enforcement of Human Rights International (CEHRI), in collaboration with the Dutch peace organization PAX, has lodged a criminal complaint against former senior executives of OMV AG, an Austrian company that had a business partnership with the Swedish company Lundin Energy AB.

The two organizations have urged Austrian prosecutors to open a criminal investigation into OMV AG, alleging that the company also abetted serious crimes committed by government forces in South Sudan between 1999 and 2003 with the aim of gaining control of an area where the Swedish-Austrian consortium wanted to search for oil.

Nearly one third of OMV AG is owned by the Austrian government. According to CEHRI and PAX, OMV AG joined the consortium in 1997 during the civil conflict in South Sudan to explore oil in Block 5A, an area beyond government control.

The region witnessed clashes marked by widespread crimes and violent displacements. Despite calls for respecting human rights, OMV AG failed to acknowledge its impact on the population. In 2003, the company sold its Sudanese assets, profiting US$50 million.

""Two former executives of Lundin are presently standing trial in Stockholm. They have been charged with complicity in war crimes while managing the Consortium in which OMV AG participated,"" CEHRI and PAX said Tuesday in a statement.

OMV AG also benefited from the alleged crimes and the victims have been denied justice since 1999, they explained. The committed atrocities allegedly include the systematic and deliberate targeting of civilians and the destruction of vital resources for survival.

""By the time OMV AG left Sudan, an estimated 12,000 people had died, 160,000 had been forcibly displaced, and their area of operation was thrown into abject poverty,"" the two organizations claimed, adding that OMV AG is believed to have been aware of the atrocities.

""OMV AG is accused of consciously accepting this in pursuit of its economic interests and of encouraging the criminal conduct of the Government of Sudan,"" according to CEHRI and PAX.

The Lundin trial in Sweden revealed that OMV AG owned 26% of the consortium. CEHRI and PAX contend that with just over one fourth of the voting power in the Joint Operating Committee, OMV AG wielded significant influence in crucial decisions.

Despite being regularly briefed on security matters and the consortium's actions, OMV's senior management never distanced themselves from the consortium's practices, according to CEHRI and PAX.

In November 2023, ADNOC submitted a non-binding offer that valued Braskem's equity at approximately $2.1bn.

Braskem in a securities filing confirmed that ADNOC has decided not to pursue the potential transaction.

""We have been informed by ADNOC that they have no interest in continuing the process of analysis and negotiations with Novonor on the potential transaction. Novonor remains fully engaged in the process, in line with its commitment to its related parties,"" the filing read.

According to Bloomberg, for years Novonor, which is financially distressed, has been attempting to divest its stake in the petrochemical company.

Brazil's state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, holding the second-largest stake in Braskem, has also been seeking a new investor to replace Novonor.

The demand for products derived from petrochemicals, such as plastics, paints and automotive parts, is anticipated to increase within the region.

Braskem's production facilities, located in Brazil and other nations, are poised for expansion should the market demand increase.

ADNOC's interest in Braskem was part of a broader strategy to expand its global chemicals portfolio and reduce its reliance on crude oil and refined products.

ADNOC is also exploring other significant transactions, including a potential multibillion-dollar deal with German chemical company Covestro and a merger of two of its plastics divisions, which would create a combined entity valued at more than $30bn.

However, these discussions have also encountered obstacles.

The proposed merger of ADNOC's Borouge with Borealis has been stalled due to valuation disagreements with Austrian partner OMV, and upcoming elections in Austria might result in further postponements.

Meanwhile, Covestro remains in ongoing negotiations with ADNOC, which may be holding out for a better offer, the report said.",offshore-technology.com,news,Offshore Technology,Shivam Mishra,0.2,452773130,1,https://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/05/ADNOC-shutterstock_1599018643-5.jpg,eng-9543102

In the statement, Braskem published the contents of a letter it received from Novonor related Adnoc's decision. Novonor said it remained fully engaged in the sale process, according to the correspondence.

""We can confirm that we have withdrawn from the process to acquire a shareholding in Braskem,"" an Adnoc spokesman said by email.

Oil producers have long supplied chemical companies with fuels like naphtha or gases that are the building blocks for plastics and other materials. Now petrostates like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are increasingly turning to chemicals to bolster demand for their natural resources amid the energy transition.

Adnoc wants to develop a global chemicals business to diversify beyond the production and sale of crude oil and refined products, which make up the bulk of the company's profit. It's also pursuing other deals, including a proposed multibillion-dollar acquisition of German chemicals group Covestro AG and a separate merger of two plastics units that would create a business worth more than $30 billion.

So far those talks have also run into hurdles. The company's plan to merge Abu Dhabi-listed Borouge Plc with Borealis AG has been held up over valuation talks with partner OMV AG of Austria.
